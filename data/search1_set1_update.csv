"Hussain, AN; Al-Jubori, WKS; Kadom, HF",Hybrid Design of Optimal Capacitor Placement and Reconfiguration for Performance Improvement in a Radial Distribution System,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING,"Distribution System Reconfiguration (DSR) and Optimal Capacitor Placement (OCP) are the most alternative techniques for increasing the power system generation and covering the growth of power demands. These techniques reduce the Radial Distribution System (RDS) losses and enhance the voltage profile. Combining both techniques gives better performance than using the individual technique. In this paper, two operation modes were implemented. First, the individual mode of OCP is applied. Second, the dual mode of DSR after OCP process is applied. Multiobjective functions with considering the weighting factors are used for minimizing real losses, improving voltage profile, and increasing saving cost. The optimal selections of open switches, location, and size of capacitors in the individual and dual design for RDS are achieved using four different optimization algorithms. These algorithms are Modified Biogeography-Based Optimization (MBBO) algorithm, Cuckoo Search (CS) algorithm, Modified Imperialist Competitive (MIC) algorithm, and Modified Bacterial Foraging-Based Optimization (MBFBO) algorithm. These algorithms are applied for two standard networks (IEEE 33- and IEEE 69-bus). Comparisons among the proposed algorithms are done, and the results demonstrated that the MBBO algorithm is the most strong and fast algorithm to attain the optimum solution. In addition, comparisons with literature works are done to validate the effectiveness of proposed algorithms.",2019,2019,10.1155/2019/1696347

The biogeographic distribution of archaeal community in mangroves remains poorly known. In this study, six mangroves at different geographic locations in China were selected. Mangrove archaeal community was found to considerably change with geographic location, which might be driven by a variety of environmental variables (etc., pH and carbon and nitrogen contents). Archaeal communities were primarily comprised of Thaumarchaeota (54.7-85.2%) and Euryarchaeota (11.8-43.9%).

"Nguyen, CH; Beattie, GAC; Haigh, AM; Astuti, IP; Mabberley, DJ; Weston, PH; Holford, P",Molecular differentiation of the Murraya paniculata Complex (Rutaceae: Aurantioideae: Aurantieae),BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,"Background: Orange jasmine has a complex nomenclatural history and is now known as Murraya paniculata (L.) Jack. Our interest in this common ornamental stemmed from the need to resolve its identity and the identities of closely related taxa as hosts of the pathogen Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus and its vector Diaphorina citri. Understanding these microbe-vector-plant relationships has been hampered by taxonomic confusion surrounding Murraya at both the generic and specific levels. Results: To resolve the taxonomic uncertainty, six regions of the maternally-inherited chloroplastal genome and part of the nuclear-encoded ITS region were amplified from 85 accessions of Murraya and Merrillia using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Clustering used maximum parsimony (MP), maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference (BI). Chronograms were produced for molecular dating, and to test the monophyly of Murraya rigorously, using selected accessions of Murraya and 26 accessions of the Rutaceae and Simarubaceae. Sequence data from the ITS and chloroplastal regions suggest that Murraya paniculata (sensu (Swingle WT and Reece CR, The Citrus Industry, p. 190-430, 1967)) can be separated into four distinct but morphologically somewhat cryptic taxa: Murraya paniculata (sensu (Mabberley DJ, Taxon 65:366-371, 2016)), M. elongata, M. sumatrana and M. lucida. In addition, Murraya omphalocarpa was identified as a putative hybrid of M. paniculata and M. lucida with two geographically isolated nothovarieties representing reciprocal crosses. Murraya is monophyletic, and molecular dating suggests that it diverged from Merrillia during the Miocene (23-5 Ma) with this Murraya group speciating and dispersing during the Middle Miocene onwards. Conclusions: The accessions from Asia and Australasia used in this study grouped into biogeographical regions that match herbarium specimen records for the taxa that suggest natural allopatric distributions with limited overlap and hybridity. Murraya paniculata has been distributed around the world as an ornamental plant. The division of the Murraya paniculata complex into four species with a rare hybrid also confirms morphological studies.",2019,19,10.1186/s12862-019-1555-4

"del Campo, J; Bass, D; Keeling, PJ",The eukaryome: Diversity and role of microeukaryotic organisms associated with animal hosts,FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,"Awareness of the roles that host-associated microbes play in host biology has escalated in recent years. However, microbiome studies have focused essentially on bacteria, and overall, we know little about the role of host-associated eukaryotes outside the field of parasitology. Despite that, eukaryotes and microeukaryotes in particular are known to be common inhabitants of animals. In many cases, and/or for long periods of time, these associations are not associated with clinical signs of disease. Unlike the study of bacterial microbiomes, the study of the microeukaryotes associated with animals has largely been restricted to visual identification or molecular targeting of particular groups. So far, since the publication of the influential Human Microbiome Project Consortium paper in 2012, few studies have been published dealing with the microeukaryotes using a high-throughput barcoding microbiome-like approach in animals. Nonetheless, microeukaryotes have an impact on the host physiology and lifestyle and also on the diversity and composition of the wider symbiotic community of bacteria and viruses. Beyond being parasites, microeukaryotes have many different roles in animals. For example, they directly interact with the host immune system in mammals; they have a key role on cellulose degradation, lignocellulose in xylophage termites and cockroaches; and they have an essential role in providing photosynthates to reef-building corals. Certain microeukaryotic lineages have diversified within hosts more than others. These cases of co-evolution led to different forms of symbiosis: from mutualism (like Symbiodinium in corals or parabasalians in termites), to commensalism (Blastocystis in humans) or to strict parasitism (apicomplexans or microsporidians in a broad range of hosts). We will review the ecological context and the evolutionary mechanisms that ended up in these different symbiotic scenarios, across the taxonomic range of both symbionts and their metazoan hosts. Host-associated microeukaryotes have impacts at many levels, from individual animal health to ecosystems and to agroeconomy. Therefore, it is crucial to have a better understanding of their diversity and roles. Novel methodologies are being developed to access the eukaryotic fraction of the microbiome using high-throughput methods. From -omics, to imaging and barcoding approaches biased against metazoans, these novel methodologies and strategies are helping us to increase and improve our knowledge of microeukaryotes in animal-associated environments.

This fact has hampered our knowledge about their ecology and genetic diversity. Here we examined 175 SAR11 genomes, including 47 new single-amplified genomes. The presence of the first genomes associated with subclade IV suggests that, in the same way as subclade V, they might be outside the proposed Pelagibacterales order. An expanded phylogenomic classification together with patterns of metagenomic recruitment at a global scale have allowed us to define new ecogenomic units of classification (genomospecies), appearing at different, and sometimes restricted, metagenomic data sets. We detected greater microdiversity across the water column at a single location than in samples collected from similar depth across the global ocean, suggesting little influence of biogeography. In addition, pangenome analysis revealed that the flexible genome was essential to shape genomospecies distribution. In one genomospecies preferentially found within the Mediterranean, a set of genes involved in phosphonate utilization was detected. While another, with a more cosmopolitan distribution, was unique in having an aerobic purine degradation pathway. Together, these results provide a glimpse of the enormous genomic diversity within this clade at a finer resolution than the currently defined clades.",,,10.1111/1462-2920.14896

Using binary presence-absence data, we evaluate species co-occurrences that help elucidate relationships among organisms and environments. To summarize similarity between occurrences of species, we routinely use the Jaccard/Tanimoto coefficient, which is the ratio of their intersection to their union. It is natural, then, to identify statistically significant Jaccard/Tanimoto coefficients, which suggest non-random co-occurrences of species. However, statistical hypothesis testing using this similarity coefficient has been seldom used or studied. Results: We introduce a hypothesis test for similarity for biological presence-absence data, using the Jaccard/Tanimoto coefficient. Several key improvements are presented including unbiased estimation of expectation and centered Jaccard/Tanimoto coefficients, that account for occurrence probabilities. The exact and asymptotic solutions are derived. To overcome a computational burden due to high-dimensionality, we propose the bootstrap and measurement concentration algorithms to efficiently estimate statistical significance of binary similarity. Comprehensive simulation studies demonstrate that our proposed methods produce accurate p-values and false discovery rates. The proposed estimation methods are orders of magnitude faster than the exact solution, particularly with an increasing dimensionality. We showcase their applications in evaluating co-occurrences of bird species in 28 islands of Vanuatu and fish species in 3347 freshwater habitats in France. The proposed methods are implemented in an open source R package called jaccard (https://cran.r-project.org/package=jaccard). Conclusion: We introduce a suite of statistical methods for the Jaccard/Tanimoto similarity coefficient for binary data, that enable straightforward incorporation of probabilistic measures in analysis for species co-occurrences. Due to their generality, the proposed methods and implementations are applicable to a wide range of binary data arising from genomics, biochemistry, and other areas of science.",2019,20,10.1186/s12859-019-3118-5

However, the extent to which geographic distance can affect marine microbial communities is still unclear, especially for the microbial communities in well-connected surface seawaters. In this study, the bacterial community compositions of 21 surface seawater samples, that were distributed over a distance of 7800 km, were surveyed to investigate how bacterial community similarity changes with increasing geographical distance. Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes were the dominant bacterial phyla, with Proteobacteria accounting for 52.6-92.5% and Bacteroidetes comprising 3.5-46.9% of the bacterial communities. A significant bacterial distance-decay relationship was observed in the well-connected Southern Ocean surface seawater. The number of pairwise shared operational taxonomic units (OTUs), and community similarities tended to decrease with increasing geographic distance. Calculation of the similarity indices with all, abundant or rare OTUs did not affect the observed distance-decay relationship. Spatial distance can largely explain the observed bacterial community variation. This study shows that even in well-connected surface waters, bacterial distance-decay patterns can be found as long as the geographical distance is great enough. The biogeographic patterns should then be present for marine microorganisms considering the large size and complexity of the marine ecosystem.",,,10.1007/s00248-019-01472-x

However, information regarding the degree of overlap and partitions of microbial communities across different habitats in grasslands is limited. This study investigated the microbial communities in three distinct habitats from Xilingol steppe grassland, i.e. animal excrement, phyllosphere, and soil samples, by Illumina MiSeq sequencing. All microbial community structures, i.e. for bacteria, archaea, and fungi, were significantly distinguished according to habitat. A high number of unique microorganisms but few coexisting microorganisms were detected, suggesting that the structure of microbial communities was mainly regulated by species selection and niche differentiation. However, the sequences of those limited coexisting microorganisms among the three different habitats accounted for over 60% of the total sequences, indicating their ability to adapt to variable environments. In addition, the biotic interactions among microorganisms based on a co-occurrence network analysis highlighted the importance of Microvirga, Blastococcus, RB41, Nitrospira, and four norank members of bacteria in connecting the different microbiomes. Collectively, the microbial communities in the Xilingol steppe grassland presented strong habitat preferences with a certain degree of dispersal and colonization potential to new habitats along the animal excrement-phyllosphere-soil gradient. This study provides the first detailed comparison of microbial communities in different habitats in a single grassland, and offers new insights into the biogeographic patterns of the microbial assemblages in grasslands.",2019,9,10.1038/s41598-019-55940-y

Here, we tested how community structure and species interactions among diverse groups of soil microbes (bacteria, fungi, non-fungal eukaryotes) change across a fundamental ecological gradient, succession. Our study system is a high-elevation alpine ecosystem that exhibits variability in successional stage due to topography and harsh environmental conditions. We used hierarchical Bayesian joint distribution modeling to remove the influence of environmental covariates on species distributions and generated interaction networks using the residual species-to-species variance-covariance matrix. We hypothesized that as ecological succession proceeds, diversity will increase, species composition will change, and soil microbial networks will become more complex. As expected, we found that diversity of most taxonomic groups increased over succession, and species composition changed considerably. Interestingly, and contrary to our hypothesis, interaction networks became less complex over succession (fewer interactions per taxon). Interactions between photosynthetic microbes and any other organism became less frequent over the gradient, whereas interactions between plants or soil microfauna and any other organism were more abundant in late succession. Results demonstrate that patterns in diversity and composition do not necessarily relate to patterns in network complexity and suggest that network analyses provide new insight into the ecology of highly diverse, microscopic communities.",2019,10,10.3389/fmicb.2019.02887

However, it is still unclear how and to what extent bacterioplankton communities respond to the two factors, despite the functional importance of bacterioplankton in biogeochemical cycles. In this study, significant organic pollution index (OPI) and offshore distance gradients, as respective proxies of disturbance intensity and disturbance frequency, were detected in a regional scale across the East China Sea. A multiple regression on matrices (MRM) revealed that the biogeography of bacterioplankton community depended on spatial scale, which was governed by local characters. Bacterioplankton community compositions (BCCs) were primarily governed by the conjointly direct (-0.28) and indirect (-0.48) effects of OPI, while offshore distance contributed a large indirectly effect (0.52). A SEGMENTED analysis depicted non-linear responses of BCCs to increasing disturbance intensity and disturbance frequency, as evidenced by significant tipping points. This was also true for the dominant bacterial phyla. Notably, we screened 30 OPI-discriminatory taxa that could quantitatively diagnose coastal OPI levels, with an overall 79.3% accuracy. Collectively, the buffer capacity of bacterioplankton communities to increasing disturbance intensity and disturbance frequency is limited, of which the significant tipping points afford a warning line for coastal management. In addition, coastal pollution level can be accurately diagnosed by a few OPI-discriminatory taxa. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2019,696,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.134015

The finch phylogeny showed moderate congruence with the microbiome, which was comprised mostly of the bacterial phyla Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria. Diet, as measured with stable isotope values and foraging observations, also correlated with microbiome differentiation. Additionally, each gut microbial community could easily be classified by the habitat of origin independent of host species.

Here, using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, we investigated the co-occurrence patterns and assembly processes of abundant and rare microbial communities during an early spring diatom bloom in Xiangshan bay. Our results showed that alpha-diversity indices in the rare subcommunity (RS) were significantly higher than those in the abundant and common subcommunities. beta-Diversity of the RS was the highest among three subcommunities, and the variation of beta-diversity in the three subcommunities was mainly induced by species turnover, which was also the highest in the RS. The assembly of microbial communities was mainly driven by the neutral processes, but the roles of neutral processes might differ in each subcommunity. Co-occurrence network analysis revealed that abundant and common operational taxonomic units were more often located in central positions within the network. Most of the modules in the network were specific to a particular bloom stage, owing to the succession of Skeletonema costatum.

Resource availability shapes microbial community structure, but less is known about how landscape-mediated availability of nutrients and carbon can control microbial functions in streams. Using comparative metagenomics, we examined the relationship between microbial functional genes and composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM), nutrients, and suspended microbial communities in 11 streams, divided into three groups based on the predominant land cover category (agriculture, forested, or wetland). Using weighted gene co-occurrence network analysis, we identified clusters of functions related to DOM composition, agricultural land use, and/or wetland and forest land cover. Wetland-dominated streams were characterized by functions related to nitrogen metabolism and processing of aromatic carbon compounds, with strong positive correlations with dissolved organic carbon concentration and DOM aromaticity. Forested streams were characterized by metabolic functions related to monomer uptake and carbohydrates, such as mannose and fructose metabolism. In agricultural streams, microbial functions were correlated with more labile, protein-like DOM, PO4, and NO3, likely reflecting functional adaptation to labile DOM and higher nutrient concentrations. Distinct changes in the functional composition and loss of functional diversity of microorganisms became evident when comparing natural to agricultural catchments. Although all streams showed signs of functional redundancy, loss of species richness per function in agricultural catchments suggests that microbial functions in natural catchments may be more resilient to disturbance.

In this study, we investigated the relationships between the composition of the soil bacterial, acidobacterial, and fungal communities and the transformation of wetlands by human activities in the Sanjiang Plain. Soil microbial communities were assessed in wetland soils collected from pristine marsh, neighboring cropland (wetland turned into arable land), and land that had been reforested with Larix gmelinii. The alpha-diversities of bacteria, Acidobacteria, and fungi were affected by land-use change and were highest in the arable land and lowest in the wetland soils. The soil microbial community structures were also altered with changing land-use. Canonical correlation analyses showed that beta-diversity was significantly affected by soil pH, available phosphorus, soil nitrogen, and total organic carbon. Overall, our results showed that the agricultural cultivation of wetlands changes the available soil carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus pools, thereby influencing the bacterial, acidobacterial, and fungal diversity and community structure. Once the soil microbial community has been altered by human activity, it might be difficult to restore it to its original state.

However, a comprehensive understanding of the diversity and community composition of microbiome associated with different plant compartments as well as bulk soils of cycad species remains elusive. Method An extensive investigation of species diversity and community composition of bacterial and fungal microbiome in roots, seeds, unfertilized seeds, ovules, pollens, and soils of Cycas panzhihuaensis L. Zhou & S. Y. Yang has been conducted by high-through sequencing technology. Moreover, principal component analysis (PCA), hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), and heatmap analysis were applied to test the niche-specific effect and biogeography factor among different sample types of this cycad species. Results Highly diverse microbiota and significant variation of community structure were found among different compartments of C. panzhihuaensis. Soils exhibited a remarkable differentiation of bacterial community composition compared to the other five plant organs as revealed by PCA, HCA, and heatmap analyses. Different compartments possessed unique core microbial taxa with Pseudomonadaceae and Nectriaceae shared among them. According to the indicator species analysis, there was almost no differentiation of dominant microbiomes with regard to the geography of the host cycad. Two main transmission models existed in the C. panzhihuaensis. Conclusions Each sample type represented a unique niche and hosted a niche-specific core microbial taxa. Contrary to previous surveys, biogeography hardly exerted impact on microbial community variation in this study. The majority of the cycad-associated microbes were horizontally derived from soils and/or air environments with the rest vertically inherited from maternal plants via seeds.

We considered these data from the perspective of a novel metacommunity framework. In agreement with our heuristic, we found evidence for distinct mechanisms underlying the composition and diversity of bacterial and fungal assemblages in precipitation. Specifically, we determined that (1) bacterial operational taxonomic unit (OTU) composition of precipitation was strongly associated with macroscale drivers including season and high-altitude characteristics of storms; (2) fungal OTU composition was strongly correlated with mesoscale drivers including particular spatial locations; (3) beta-diversity (heterogeneity of taxa among samples) for both bacteria and fungi was largely maintained by turnover of taxa; however, (4) bacterial assemblages had higher contributions to total beta-diversity from nestedness (i.e., lower richness assemblages were largely taxonomic subsets of richer assemblages), due to losses of taxa during dispersal, particularly among potential ice nucleation active bacteria; and (5) fungal assemblages had higher contributions to total beta-diversity from turnover due to OTU replacement. Spatiotemporal trends in precipitation-borne metacommunities allowed delineation of a large number of statistically significant indicator taxa for particular sites and seasons, including trends for bacteria that are potentially ice nucleation active.

However, little is known about the relative importance of the different ecological processes underlying the assembly of communities of sand microbiota. Here, we employed 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing to investigate the sand microbiota of two coastal beaches, in southern China. The results showed that sand microbial assemblages at intertidal and supratidal zones exhibited contrasting compositions that can be attributed to environmental filtering by electric conductivity. A consistent pattern of habitat generalists and specialists of sand microbiota was observed among different beach zones. Null and neutral model analyses indicated that the environmental filtering was mainly responsible for supratidal microbial communities, while the neutral processes could partially influence the assembly of intertidal communities. Moreover, environmental filtering was found to shape the habitat specialists, while random dispersal played a major role in shaping generalists. The neutral model analysis revealed that the habitat generalists exceeding the neutral prediction harbored a relatively higher proportion of microbial taxa than the specialist counterparts.

In soil, these mechanisms support fertility. Genes associated with hydrolysis of organic phosphoesters represent an interesting set of genes with which to study maintenance of function in microbiomes. Here, we shown that the richness of ecotypes for each gene varies considerably in response to application of manure and various inorganic fertilizer combinations. We show, at unprecedented phylogenetic resolution, that phylogenetic diversity of phosphohydrolase genes are more responsive to soil management and edaphic factors than the taxonomic biomarker 16S rRNA gene. Available phosphorus - assessed by measuring Olsen-P - exerted some influence on alkaline phosphatase distribution: however, consistent and significant differences were observed in gene abundance between treatments that were inconsistent with bioavailable orthophosphate being the dominant factor determining gene abundance. Instead, we observed gene niche separation which was most strongly associated with soil exchangeable calcium. Our study suggests that the bioavailability of enzyme cofactors (exchangeable calcium in the case of phoD, phoX and beta PPhy studied here) influence the abundance of genes in soil microbial communities; in the absence of cofactors, genes coding for alternative enzyme families that do not require the limiting cofactor (for example, non-specific acid phosphatases which require vanadate) become more abundant.",2019,139,10.1016/j.soilbio.2019.107613

However, only little is known about temporal variation in metacommunities and their underlying drivers. We examined temporal variation in the relative roles of environmental and spatial factors for diatom community composition among brackish-watered rock pools on the Baltic Sea coast over a 3-month period. We used a combination of direct ordination, variation partition, and Mantel tests to investigate the metacommunity patterns. The studied communities housed a mixture of freshwater, brackish, and marine species, with a decreasing share of salinity tolerant species along both temporal and spatial gradients. The community composition was explained by both environmental and spatial variables (especially conductivity and distance from the sea) in each month; the joint effect of these factors was consistently larger than the pure effects of either variable group. Community similarity was related to both environmental and spatial distance between the pools even when the other variable group was controlled for. The relative influence of environmental factors increased with time, accounting for the largest share of the variation in species composition and distance decay of similarity in July. Metacommunity organization in the studied rock pools was probably largely explained by a combination of species sorting and mass effect given the small spatial study scale. The found strong distance decay of community similarity indicates spatially highly heterogeneous diatom communities mainly driven by temporally varying conductivity gradient at the marine-freshwater transition zone.",2019,49,10.1007/s12526-019-01016-z

Sparsely-distributed freshwater systems in arid central Australia provide important refuges for mobile species and act as biotic reservoirs under adverse conditions. Some of these perennial systems are also evolutionary refugia that support relictual insects. Microbes play an important role in driving aquatic biogeochemical processes, but little is known about their composition and spatial patterns in and across these arid landscapes. Here we sought to assess the diversity and spatial distribution of aquatic Bacteria and Archaea in arid Australian waterbodies. We used 16s-rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to analyze the structure of microbial assemblages in biofilms and the water column from 8 waterbodies along a geographic axis across 2 drainage divisions. We used isotope hydrology to differentiate between groundwater-dominated waterbodies and those fed by surface water. We tested predictions and used metacommunity theory to explore spatial patterns between water column and biofilm microbiota, between perennial and temporary waterbodies, and between groundwater-fed and surface water-fed systems. We found greater similarity between assemblages of water column microbiota than those of the benthic biofilms. The spatial distributions of water column and biofilm assemblages were best explained by different metacommunity concepts. Distance decay matched the composition of the water column microbiota, whereas species sorting appeared to drive the composition of biofilm assemblages. The latter showed considerable within-site variability, changing with the type of benthic substrate present. Electrical conductivity and pH partly explained the composition of the water column and biofilm microbial assemblages, but only the water column microbiota was associated with the aquatic isotopic signatures. No distinctive microbiota were associated with perennial, groundwater-dominated sites previously identified as evolutionary refugia for aquatic insects. Temporary waterbodies contained significantly more heat and arid resilient microbial taxa commonly found in soils. Further investigation of temporal dynamics is now needed to determine how arid land aquatic microbiota might change under a warming climate.",2019,38,10.1086/706106

Unraveling the relative importance of stochastic versus deterministic processes in shaping biogeographic patterns of fungal communities has long been a challenge in microbial ecology, owing to high biodiversity and difficulties in identifying fungal taxa. Using a unique anthropogenic system of geographically isolated paddy islands, we collected 198 soil samples with a spatially explicit design to examine how ecological processes shaped fungal biogeographic patterns. Fungal community structure showed scale-dependent distance-decay relationships. Stochastic processes (dispersal and drift) contributed more to community assembly than deterministic processes (selection) at the local scale, which was largely attributed to drift. In contrast, deterministic processes contributed more to community assembly than stochastic processes at the regional scale, with soil dissolved organic carbon being the most important measured factor. Collectively, scale dependence of fungal biogeographical patterns in paddy soils is influenced by differential contribution of deterministic and stochastic processes.

Some Microcystis strains produce harmful toxins such as microcystin, impacting drinking water quality. Microcystis colony morphology, rather than genetic similarity, is often used to classify Microcystis into morphospecies. Yet colony morphology is a plastic trait, which can change depending on environmental and laboratory culture conditions, and is thus an inadequate criterion for species delineation. Furthermore, Microcystis populations are thought to disperse globally and constitute a homogeneous gene pool. However, this assertion is based on relatively incomplete characterization of Microcystis genomic diversity. To better understand these issues, we performed a population genomic analysis of 33 newly sequenced genomes mainly from Canada and Brazil. We identified 17 Microcystis clusters of genomic similarity, five of which correspond to monophyletic clades containing at least three newly sequenced genomes. Four out of these five clades match to named morphospecies. Notably, M. aeruginosa is paraphyletic, distributed across 12 genomic clusters, suggesting it is not a coherent species. A few clades of closely related isolates are specific to a unique geographic location, suggesting biogeographic structure over relatively short evolutionary time scales. Higher homologous recombination rates within than between clades further suggest that monophyletic groups might adhere to a Biological Species-like concept, in which barriers to gene flow maintain species distinctness. However, certain genes-including some involved in microcystin and micropeptin biosynthesis-are recombined between monophyletic groups in the same geographic location, suggesting local adaptation.",2019,13,10.1038/s41396-019-0481-1

Notably, members of the Rickettsiales genus Wolbachia influence several aspects of the fitness and evolution of their terrestrial hosts, but few analogous partnerships have been found in marine systems. We report here the genome, phylogenetics, and biogeography of a ubiquitous and novel Rickettsiales species that primarily associates with marine organisms. We previously showed that this bacterium was found in scleractinian corals, responds to nutrient exposure, and is associated with reduced host growth and increased mortality. This bacterium, like other Rickettsiales, has a reduced genome indicative of a parasitic lifestyle. Phylogenetic analysis places this Rickettsiales within a new genus we define as Candidatus Aquarickettsia. Using data from the Earth Microbiome Project and SRA databases, we also demonstrate that members of Ca. Aquarickettsia are found globally in dozens of invertebrate lineages. The coral-associated Candidatus A. rohweri is the first finished genome in this new Glade. Ca. A. rohweri lacks genes to synthesize most sugars and amino acids but possesses several genes linked to pathogenicity including Tlc, an antiporter that exchanges host ATP for ADP, and a complete Type IV secretion system. Despite its inability to metabolize nitrogen, Ca. A. rohweri possesses the NtrY-NtrX two-component system involved in sensing and responding to extracellular nitrogen. Given these data, along with visualization of the parasite in host tissues, we hypothesize that Ca. A. rohweri reduces coral health by consuming host nutrients and energy, thus weakening and eventually killing host cells. Last, we hypothesize that nutrient enrichment, which is increasingly common on coral reefs, encourages unrestricted growth of Ca.

However, the biogeography of soil fungi in the forest ecosystem is poorly understand, especially in arid or semiarid areas. Here, a regional scale study in an arid area was conducted on the Loess Plateau to illustrate the geographic distributions of soil fungi and their driving forces. The results showed that Ascomycota, Basidiomycota and Zygomycota were the most dominant phyla in 24 sample sites. Fungal Shannon diversity and OTUs richness were significantly correlated with mean annual precipitation (MAP), total soil nitrogen (TN), ammonium nitrogen (NH4N) and soil organic carbon (SOC) levels. The decay-curve analysis demonstrated that soil fungal Bray-Cutis dissimilarities were significantly regressed with geographic distance, revealing that the soil fungal community structure was affected by historical factors. Variation partitioning analysis revealed that the soil properties (15%) contributed more to the fungal community variations than geographic distance (9%). Additionally, there were many predictors of soil fungi geography that were not detected. These results suggest that the fungal geography on the Loess Plateau is mainly regulated by soil properties or other unmeasured variables.

In this study, we used 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to investigate the prokaryotic microbiomes (bacteria and archaea) in the Ogosta river floodplain, which is contaminated because of historic mining and a tailings dam failure in 1964. We established a 700 m long soil transect exhibiting extreme contamination gradients particularly reflected in arsenic levels, ranging from < 50 mg to > 10 g per kg soil. Boosted regression trees analysis suggested that microbial biomass (soil DNA as proxy) and prokaryotic taxonomic and phylogenetic richness were mainly determined by the availability of limiting nutrients, first of all organic C, but were also positively related to the contamination. Taxonomic evenness was evidenced to be mainly determined by the contamination level, with more strongly contaminated soils harboring more even communities. Soil pH was indicated to play an important role in community shifts between the soils (beta-diversity). Functional profiling through hidden state prediction (HSP) evidenced that relative numbers of metal(loid) resistance and antioxidant defense genes were positively related to the level of contamination and tended to co-occur in the inferred genomes. Our results contrast the common prediction of decreased microbial biomass and diversity because of metal(loid) contamination. We suggest that in our study the net increase in prokaryotic community richness and evenness is related to mild toxicity diminishing competitive advantages of dominating OTUs, allowing other OTUs to thrive which were competitively excluded.",2019,144,10.1016/j.apsoil.2019.07.022

However, understanding interactions between plastic and microbes in the Plastisphere-the thin layer of life on the surface of PMD-has been technology-limited. Research into microbe-microbe and microbe-substrate interactions requires knowledge of community phylogenetic composition but also tools to visualize spatial distributions of intact microbial biofilm communities. We developed a CLASI-FISH (combinatorial labelling and spectral imaging - fluorescence in situ hybridization) method using confocal microscopy to study Plastisphere communities. We created a probe set consisting of three existing phylogenetic probes (targeting all Bacteria, Alpha-, and Gammaproteobacteria) and four newly designed probes (targeting Bacteroidetes, Vibrionaceae, Rhodobacteraceae and Alteromonadaceae) labelled with a total of seven fluorophores and validated this probe set using pure cultures. Our nested probe set strategy increases confidence in taxonomic identification because targets are confirmed with two or more probes, reducing false positives. We simultaneously identified and visualized these taxa and their spatial distribution within the microbial biofilms on polyethylene samples in colonization time series experiments in coastal environments from three different biogeographical regions. Comparing the relative abundance of 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing data with cell-count abundance data retrieved from the microscope images of the same samples showed a good agreement in bacterial composition.

Here we examine microbial (prokaryotic and eukaryotic) community changes associated with the surface low salinity layer (LSL) and underlying seawater in multiple fjords in Fiordland National Park (New Zealand). High rainfall (1200-8000 mm annually) and linked runoff from native forested catchments results in surface LSLs with high tannin concentrations within each fjord. These gradients are expected to drive changes in microbial communities. We used amplicon sequencing (16S and 18S) to assess the impact of these gradients on microbial communities and identified depth linked changes in diversity and community structure. With increasing depth, we observed significant increases in Proteobacteria (15%) and SAR (37%), decreases in Opisthokonta (35%), and transiently increased Bacteroidetes (3% increase from 0 to 40 m, decreasing by 8% at 200 m). Community structure differences were observed along a transect from the head to the mouth, specifically 25% mean relative abundance decreases in Opisthokonta and Bacteroidetes, and increases in SAR (25%) and Proteobacteria (>5%) at the surface, indicating changes based on distance from the ocean.

During the past decades, nitrogen (N) addition induced by human has been regarded as the main driver of global changes to soil microecological processes. Although growing studies demonstrated the loss of biodiversity due to N addition in regional scale, the role of global N addition on soil microbial diversity is lacking. Here, we sought to illuminate the impacts and driving factors of soil microbial diversity in relation to global N addition using a meta-analysis from 1,078 paired observations in 212 studies. We found a negative influence of global N addition on soil microbial diversity, and the reduction of soil microbial diversity was determined by land use types, N fertility types, methods, N addition rates, and duration. In fact, there was a linear decrease of soil microbial diversity along the latitudinal gradient, and N addition-induced acidification was the predominant contributor to the reduction of soil microbial diversity. Both of soil properties (pH, soil organic carbon, soil total N, and soil microbial biomass C) and climatic factors (mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation) determined soil microbial diversity under global N addition. It was noted that soil fungal diversity was more adaptable to acidic environments, whereas soil bacterial diversity was more adaptable to neutral environment. Most importantly, soil fungal diversity was more sensitive than soil bacterial diversity under global N addition. Our meta-analysis provides a new insight in understanding the key role of global N addition in shaping soil microbial diversity. Thereby, we recommend that future research should be focused on the soil microbial processes using manipulative controlled experiments, which identify the available measures to reduce the loss of soil microbial diversity globally.",2020,31,10.1002/ldr.3439

The passenger hypothesis assumes that this heterogeneity is driven by host plant distribution. Plant composition and host plant configuration should then influence root fungal assemblages. We used a large-scale experimental design of 25 mixtures of grassland plants. We sampled Brachypodium pinnatum in each mesocosm, and used amplicon mass-sequencing to analyze the endospheric mycobiota. We used plant distribution maps to assess plant species richness and evenness (heterogeneity of composition), and patch size and the degree of isolation of B. pinnatum (heterogeneity of configuration) on fungal community assembly. The Glomeromycotina community in B. pinnatum roots was not related to either floristic heterogeneity or productivity. For Ascomycota, the composition of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) was driven by plant evenness while OTU richness decreased with plant richness. For Basidiomycota, richness increased with host plant aggregation and connectivity. Plant productivity influenced Ascomycota, inducing a shift in OTU composition and decreasing evenness. Plant heterogeneity modified root mycobiota, with potential direct (i.e. host preference) and indirect (i.e. adaptations to abiotic conditions driven by plant occurrence over time) effects.

"Thompson, AW; Kouba, K",Differential Activity of Coexisting Prochlorococcus Ecotypes,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,"The abundance and widespread distribution of the unicellular cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus is attributed to its extensive genetic diversity. At least twelve distinct clades, or ecotypes, of Prochlorococcus have been discovered so far, and follow distinct distribution patterns over horizontal and vertical gradients in the oligotrophic ocean. However, multiple ecotypes (and sub-ecotypes) of Prochlorococcus always coexist in varying proportions. While laboratory experiments and genomic analysis suggest that ecotypes contribute differently to biogeochemical cycles, no studies have tested the differential activity of coexisting ecotypes in natural assemblages of Prochlorococcus. Here, we performed DNA stable isotope probing (DNA-SIP) experiments in on-deck incubations of oceanic microbial communities with C-13-labeled bicarbonate to identify ecotypes actively assimilating carbon. In addition, we identified cells in G1 and G2 phases of the cell cycle to determine the ecotypes engaged in cell division. We found that closely related ecotypes and sub-ecotypes could exhibit differential activity in carbon assimilation and cell division. In the case of cell division, the most actively dividing ecotype was among the most abundant ecotypes. In the case of carbon assimilation, both a rare OTU and an abundant OTU were the most active. We discuss how intrinsic genomic characteristics, acclimation state, microbial interactions, and physical dynamics of the ocean could contribute to these patterns of activity. Together, these experiments suggest that Prochlorococcus community structure is an important facet of Prochlorococcus contributions to the ocean ecosystem that should be studied further to predict the influence of Prochlorococcus on global processes.",2019,6,10.3389/fmars.2019.00701

Additionally, patterns of genetic variation in interacting species can reveal ecological traits that are important to gene flow and co-evolution. In this study, we define patterns of spatial and temporal genetic variation of a coral reef fish, Siphamia tubifer, and its luminous bacterial symbiont, Photobacterium mandapamensis in the Okinawa Islands, Japan. Using restriction site-associated sequencing (RAD-Seq) methods, we show that populations of the facultative light organ symbiont of S. tubifer exhibit genetic structure at fine spatial scales of tens of kilometers despite the absence of physical barriers to dispersal and in contrast to populations of the host fish. These results suggest that the hosts behavioral ecology and environmental interactions between host and symbiont help to structure symbiont populations in the region, consequently fostering the specificity of the association between host generations. Our approach also revealed several symbiont genes that were divergent between host populations, including hfq and a homolog of varS, both of which play a role in host association in Vibrio cholerae.

While surface nutrient supply impacts the elemental ratios of primary production, stoichiometric control by remineralization remains unclear. Here we develop a mechanistic description of remineralization and its stoichiometry in a marine microbial ecosystem model. The model simulates the observed elemental plasticity of phytoplankton and the relatively constant, lower C:N of heterotrophic biomass. In addition, the model captures the observed decreases in the C:N of more labile dissolved organic matter (DOM) and the C:N of its remineralization with depth, which are driven by a switch in the dominant source of DOM from phytoplankton to heterotrophic biomass. Only a model version with targeted remineralization of N-rich components is able to simulate the observed profiles of preferential remineralization of N relative to C and the elevated C:N of bulk DOM. The model suggests that more labile substrates are associated with C-limited heterotrophic growth and not with preferential remineralization, while less labile substrates are associated with growth limited by processing rates and with preferential remineralization. The resulting patterns of variable remineralization stoichiometry mediate the extent to which a proportional increase in carbon production resulting from changes in phytoplankton stoichiometry can increase the efficiency of the biological pump.

However, the generality in beta diversity patterns and underlying processes remains less studied across trophic levels and geographical regions. We documented beta diversity patterns and underlying ecological processes of stream bacteria, diatoms and macroinvertebrates along six elevational gradients. Locations Asia and Europe. Methods We examined stream communities using molecular and morphological methods. We characterised community uniqueness with local contributions to beta diversity (LCBD), and investigated the drivers of its geographic patterns using Mid-Domain Effect (MDE), coenocline simulation, Raup-Crick null model approach, and through comparisons to environmental factors. MDE is a stochastic model by considering species elevational range, while coenocline simulation is a deterministic model by considering species niche optima and tolerance. The null model provides possible underlying mechanisms of community assembly with the degree to which deterministic processes create communities deviating from those of null expectations. Results Across all taxa, we revealed a general U-shaped LCBD-elevation relationship, suggesting higher uniqueness of community composition at both elevational ends. This pattern was confirmed and could be explained by both stochastic and deterministic models, that is, MDE and coenocline simulation, respectively, and was supported by the dominance of species replacement. Temperature was the main environmental factor underlying elevational patterns in LCBD. The generalists with broad niche breadths were key in maintaining community uniqueness, and the higher relative importance of deterministic processes resulted in stronger U-shaped patterns regardless of taxonomic group. Conclusions Our synthesis across both mountains and taxonomic groups clearly shows that there are consistent elevational patterns in LCBD among taxonomic groups, and that these patterns are explained by similar ecological mechanisms, producing a more complete picture for understanding and bridging the spatial variation in biodiversity under changing climate.",,,10.1111/geb.13035

Here, we surveyed the microbiome associated with Microcystis aeruginosa during blooms in 12 lakes spanning four continents as an initial test of the hypothesized Microcystis interactome. We predicted that microbiome composition and functional potential would be similar across blooms globally. Our results, as revealed by 16S rRNA sequence similarity, indicate that M. aeruginosa is cosmopolitan in lakes across a 280 degrees longitudinal and 90 degrees latitudinal gradient. The microbiome communities were represented by a wide range of operational taxonomic units and relative abundances. Highly abundant taxa were more related and shared across most sites and did not vary with geographic distance, thus, like Microcystis, revealing no evidence for dispersal limitation. High phylogenetic relatedness, both within and across lakes, indicates that microbiome bacteria with similar functional potential were associated with all blooms. While Microcystis and the microbiome bacteria shared many genes, whole-community metagenomic analysis revealed a suite of biochemical pathways that could be considered complementary.

However, the response of microbial functional gene structure (FGS) to regime shift has not been thoroughly elucidated to date. In this study, we used a functional gene array (GeoChip 5.0) in combination with high-throughput sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene to investigate the FGS and BCC between the two regimes in Lake Taihu, a large shallow freshwater lake in China. A simultaneous change in the BCC and FGS was observed between the two different regimes. We observed higher numbers of bacterial operational taxonomic units and functional genes detected by the GeoChip 5.0 in the MD samples than in the PD samples. By performing network analyses, we observed stronger microbe-microbe interactions but weaker functional gene interactions involved in nutrient metabolism in the MD community than in the PD community. We speculate that at higher concentrations of phosphorus, the domination of Microcystis bloom may weaken the interactions among microbial species by releasing more labile dissolved organic carbon, but enhance the selection and interactions of functional genes involved in carbon cycling in the PD community. In contrast, the lower levels of phosphorus may enhance microbe-microbe interactions but weaken the interactions between the primary nutrients and particular genes.

Community compositions differed significantly between planktonic and benthic microeukaryotes, with the former presenting size-fractionated discrepancies and the latter showing seasonal variation. Community turnover between planktonic and benthic microeukaryotes was mainly driven by stramenopiles and alveolates. Distance-decay patterns were found in both communities, with the rate of community turnover being higher for planktonic than benthic microeukaryotes. Among the environmental factors measured, the concentration of Cd and the water content of sediment were closely associated with benthic community variations, whereas none of the factors measured was identified as being responsible for planktonic community variation. Phylogenetic null model analysis indicated that dispersal limitation was the most crucial ecological process mediating community assembly for both planktonic and benthic microeukaryotes in intertidal zones, with heterogeneous selection making a higher contribution to community variation of benthic than planktonic microeukaryotes. Stochastic processes, mainly dispersal limitation, were found to prevail in both communities. This study thus provides new insights into the diversity distribution and assembly mechanism of microeukaryotes in intertidal zones.",2019,10,10.3389/fmicb.2019.02640

Yet, we lack an integrative conceptual framework for understanding the patterns and mechanisms driving soil biodiversity. One of the underlying reasons for our poor understanding of soil biodiversity patterns relates to whether key biodiversity theories (historically developed for aboveground and aquatic organisms) are applicable to patterns of soil biodiversity. Here, we present a systematic literature review to investigate whether and how key biodiversity theories (species-energy relationship, theory of island biogeography, metacommunity theory, niche theory and neutral theory) can explain observed patterns of soil biodiversity. We then discuss two spatial compartments nested within soil at which biodiversity theories can be applied to acknowledge the scale-dependent nature of soil biodiversity.",2020,95,10.1111/brv.12567

Here, we perform deep sequencing of the CRISPRome-all spacers contained in a microbiome-associated with hyperthermophilic archaea of the order Sulfolobales recovered directly from an environmental sample and from enrichment cultures established in the laboratory. The 25 million CRISPR spacers sequenced from a single sampling site dwarf the diversity of spacers from all available Sulfolobales isolates and display complex temporal dynamics. Comparison of closely related virus strains shows that CRISPR targeting drives virus genome evolution. Furthermore, we show that some archaeal viruses carry mini-CRISPR arrays with 1-2 spacers and preceded by leader sequences but devoid of cas genes. Closely related viruses present in the same population carry spacers against each other. Targeting by these virus-borne spacers represents a distinct mechanism of heterotypic superinfection exclusion and appears to promote archaeal virus speciation.",2019,10,10.1038/s41467-019-13205-2

A close relationship between soil biodiversity and soil physicochemical properties (e.g. soil pH) is evident in most studies, but a large unexplained residual variance is usually reported. This suggests that a deeper exploration into the multidimensional nature of these biotic-abiotic interactions will help develop our understanding of how a combination of soil properties drives soil biodiversity more than any one soil attribute. This was tested by analysing the multivariate associations between soil microbial diversity and soil physicochemical heterogeneity across different Australian soil landscapes. The study area involved two orthogonal transects each of -1000 km across the state of New South Wales (NSW). A set of 33 abiotic attributes including soil properties and other key environmental covariates were correlated against a soil microbial DNA dataset (16S rRNA and ITS genes) to profile the soil bio-physicochemical relationships. This was undertaken for two land use archetypes representing natural and managed ecosystems. The study found that soil microbial communities were highly related to multiple soil attributes and vegetation. Even though the extent of these relationships varied depending on the environmental scenario and the structural microbial community component analysed, the multidimensional association with soil heterogeneity was evident beyond any single soil property, environmental gradient or land use.",2019,354,10.1016/j.geoderma.2019.07.018

The study of local communities along a regional metacommunity can reveal patterns of community assembly, and disentangle the underlying ecological processes. In particular, we seek drivers of community assembly at the regional scale using a large lacustrine dataset (>300 lakes) along the geographical, limnological and physico-chemical gradients in the Pyrenees. By using high throughput amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, and inferring environmental sources of bacterial immigrants, we showed that surface aquatic bacterial assemblages were strongly influenced by terrestrial populations from soil, biofilms or sediments, and primarily selected by a pH-alkalinity gradient. Indeed, source proportions explained 27% of the community variation, and chemistry 15% of the total variation, half of it shared with the sources. Major taxonomic groups such as Verrucomicrobia, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes showed higher aquatic affinities than Parcubacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria or Betaproteobacteria, which may be recruited and selected through different hydrographic habitats. A regional fingerprint was observed with lower alpha diversity and higher beta diversity in the central Pyrenees than in both ends.

Previous studies report that anammox bacteria are distributed in a wide range of habitats and plays significant roles in the global nitrogen cycle. However, most studies focus only on individual ecosystems or datasets from public databases. To date, our understanding of how anammox bacteria respond to environmental properties and are distributed in different habitats on a global scale, remain unclear. To explore the global distribution of anammox bacteria, samples were collected from different habitats at different locations globally, including wetlands, drylands, groundwater aquifers and snow from 10 countries across six continents. We then used high-throughput amplicon sequencing targeting the functional gene hydrazine synthase (HZS) and generated community profiles. Results showed that Candidatus Brocadia is detected as the dominant genus on a global scale, accounting for 80.0% to 99.9% of the retrieved sequences in different habitats. The Jettenia-like sequences were the second most abundant group, accounting for no more than 19.9% of the retrieved sequences in all sites. The samples in drylands, wetlands and groundwater aquifers showed similar community composition and diversity, with the snow samples being the most different. Deterministic processes seem stronger in regulating the community composition of anammox bacteria, which is supported by the higher proportion explained by local-scale factors. Groundwater aquifers showed high gene abundance and the most complex co-occurrence network among the four habitat types, suggesting that it might be the preferred habitat of anammox bacteria. There is little competition between anammox bacterial species based on co-occurrence analysis. Hence, we could infer that environmental factors such as anaerobic and stable conditions, instead of substrate limitations, may be vital factors determining the anammox bacteria community. These results provide a better understanding of the global distribution of anammox bacteria and the ecological factors that affect their community structuring in diverse habitats.",2019,10,10.3389/fmicb.2019.02583

The sampled soils at the center of the Critical Zone were acidic, highly weathered, and clay loam to clay in texture, and developed from Quaternary red clay. Bacterial richness and phylogenetic diversity decreased with depth in the upper soil zone (0-90 cm), but was constant in the deeper zone (90-420 cm). In both the upper and deeper zones, richness was strongly and positively correlated with total organic carbon, dissolved organic carbon and total nitrogen. Depth-dependent changes of community structure were observed above the upper but not deeper zones.

By using high-performance cell sorting, P. bekefii-like cell rosettes were selectively enriched from lake water. The retrieved 16S rRNA gene sequence was nearly identical to those in dozens of metagenomes assembled from freshwater lakes during cyanobacterial blooms and was phylogenetically placed within a large group of environmental sequences originating from various freshwater habitats worldwide.

This study focuses on the assembly processes in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area (TGRA). A total of 42 sediment samples were collected from the TGRA, both in the mainstream and the tributaries, and in different seasons. Metagenomic analyses of 16S rRNA using Exact Sequence Variants revealed the spatiotemporal distribution patterns of the microbial communities. Linear regressions between dissimilarity of microbial communities, geographic and environmental distance showed that environmental, rather than geographic factors, impacted the microbial community. However, the environmental differences explained little variations (14.14%) in community structure, implying the homogeneity of environmental conditions across the TGRA From the quantification of ecological processes, homogeneous selection was shown to be a dominating factor (51.34%) in the assembly of the microbial communities. The co-occurrence network showed that keystone species were more important than prevalent abundant species in interspecies interactions. Overall, the assembly of microbial community in the deep-water reservoir sediment is mediated by both deterministic and stochastic processes, and homogeneous selection plays a leading role.

One of them is Bacillus subtilis, which can travel around the world through dust storms rising from various deserts. Upon landing, bacterial survival is determined by the ability to adjust to the heterogonous environments and bacteria isolated from extremely different environments, such as desert and riverbank soil, are expected to be less related due to the environmental pressure of each region. However, little is known about the influence of soil and habitat on B. subtilis evolution. Here, we show that desert and riverbank B. subtilis strains differ in genetic relatedness and physiological traits, such as biofilm morphology and utilisation of carbon sources. Desert strains showed more diversity at the genetic level and were able to utilise more carbon sources than riverbank strains which were highly genetically conserved. Biofilm morphologies of desert and riverbank strains generally segregated and both groups formed different morphology clusters despite the astonishing diversity observed among riverbank strains.

Microbial communities found within peat-rich systems are important biogeochemical cyclers in terms of methane and carbon dioxide sequestration. To address the critical lack of knowledge about microbial communities in tropical (peat-draining) rivers, this study represents the first seasonal assessment targeted at establishing a foundational understanding of the microbial communities of the Rajang River-South China Sea continuum. This was carried out utilising 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing via Illumina MiSeq in size-fractionated samples (0.2 and 3.0 mu m GF/C filter membranes) covering different biogeographical features and sources from headwaters to coastal waters. The microbial communities found along the Rajang River exhibited taxa common to rivers (i.e. predominance of beta-Proteobacteria) while estuarine and marine regions exhibited taxa that were common to the aforementioned regions as well (i.e. predominance of alpha- and gamma-Proteobacteria). This is in agreement with studies from other rivers which observed similar changes along salinity gradients. In terms of particulate versus free-living bacteria, nonmetric multi-dimensional scaling (NMDS) results showed similarly distributed microbial communities with varying separation between seasons. Distinct patterns were observed based on linear models as a result of the changes in salinity along with variation of other biogeochemical parameters. Alpha diversity indices indicated that microbial communities were higher in diversity upstream compared to the marine and estuarine regions, whereas anthropogenic perturbations led to increased richness but less diversity. Despite the observed changes in bacterial community composition and diversity that occur along the continuum of the Rajang River to the sea, the PICRUSt predictions showed minor variations. The results provide essential context for future studies such as further analyses on the ecosystem response to anthropogenic land-use practices and probable development of biomarkers to improve the monitoring of water quality in this region.",2019,16,10.5194/bg-16-4243-2019

The typical argument has been that phytoplankton is ubiquitous, but that distinct assemblages form under environmental selection. It is well established that phytoplankton assemblages vary considerably between coastal ecosystems. However, the relative roles of compartmentalization of regional seas and site-specific environmental conditions in shaping assemblage structures have not been specifically examined. We collected data from coastal embayments that fall within two different water compartments within the same regional sea and are characterized by highly localized environmental pressures. We used principal coordinates of neighbour matrices (PCNM) and asymmetric eigenvector maps (AEM) models to partition the effects that spatial structures, environmental conditions and their overlap had on the variation in assemblage composition. Our models explained a high percentage of variation in assemblage composition (59-65%) and showed that spatial structure consistent with marine compartmentalization played a more important role than local environmental conditions. At least during the study period, surface currents connecting sites within the two compartments failed to generate sufficient dispersal to offset the impact of differences due to compartmentalization. In other words, our findings suggest that, even for a prototypical cosmopolitan group, everything is not everywhere.",2019,286,10.1098/rspb.2019.1890

However, it remains challenging to quantitatively evaluate the contribution of this process to the microbial diversity and function in the receiving ecosystems. Currently used methods, i.e., counting shared microbial species, microbial source tracking, and neutral community model, rely on abundance profile to reveal the extent of overlapping between the upstream and downstream communities. Thus, they cannot suggest the quantitative contribution of immigrants to the downstream community function because activities of individual immigrants are not considered after entering the receiving environment. This limitation can be overcome by using an approach that couples a mass balance model with high-throughput DNA sequencing, i.e., ecogenomics-based mass balance. It calculates the net growth rate of individual microbial immigrants and partitions the entire community into active populations that contribute to the community function and inactive ones that carry minimal function. Linking activities of immigrants to their abundance further provides quantification of the contribution from an upstream environment to the downstream community. Considering only active populations can improve the accuracy of identifying key environmental parameters dictating process performance using methods such as machine learning.",2019,7,10.1186/s40168-019-0760-0

We recently described novel Olpidiopsis species infecting red algae in Scotland, and thus hypothesized that this genus is more abundant and widespread than previously recognized. Here, we show that the eukaryotic microbiome of macroscopically healthy Porphyra umbilicalis thalli frequently contains marker genes closely related to Olpidiopsis. Thanks to a custom pipeline that allows for de novo OTU and biogeography discovery, and the recovery of precomputed OTUs from large-scale metabarcoding campaigns, we unveil more than 20 unknown Olpidiopsis taxa with a worldwide distribution. Additionally, laboratory-controlled cross-infection experiments show that a Scottish variety of O. porphyrae is virulent on the most commonly cultivated Pyropia yezoensis cultivar in Korea and that conversely, a Korean strain of O. porphyrae successfully infects wild Bangia sp. strains isolated from Scotland. These results provide proof-of-concept that a native Olpidiopsis pathogen may threaten an introduced crop or that an Olpidiopsis pathogen potentially introduced alongside a non-native crop might cross-infect a native European alga. Thus, we draw parallels with several current biosecurity crises, where major risks to native floras and faunas, as well as crops, are caused by the inadvertent introduction of poorly known pathogens through the agricultural and horticultural trades. Therefore, we express concern that the rapid growth of algal cultivation worldwide, linked to international movement of seaweed seed and the absence of biosecurity monitoring or regulation pertaining to this trade, potentially lays the ground for grave ecological and economic crises in the marine environment.",,,10.1080/09670262.2019.1664769

To tackle this challenge, the construction of computational models of interacting microbes is an indispensable tool.

Here, we seek to demonstrate how resource allocation models of microbial growth offer the potential to advance ecosystem simulations and their parametrization. In particular, recent work on quantitative resource allocation allow us to formulate mechanistic models of microbial growth that are physiologically meaningful while remaining computationally tractable. These models go beyond Michaelis-Menten and Monod-type growth models, and are capable of accounting for emergent properties that underlie the remarkable plasticity of microbial growth. We outline the utility and advantages of using biochemical resource allocation models by considering a coarse-grained model of cyanobacterial growth and demonstrate how the model allows us to address specific questions of relevance for the simulation of marine microbial ecosystems, including the physiological acclimation of protein expression to different environments, the description of co-limitation by several nutrients and the differential use of alternative nutrient sources, as well as the description of metabolic diversity based on our increasing knowledge about quantitative cell physiology.",2019,16,10.1098/rsif.2019.0474

Using the Lake Hazen watershed (Nunavut, Canada; 82 degrees N, 71 degrees W) as a sentinel system, we related microbial community composition (16S rRNA gene sequencing) to physicochemical parameters (e.g. dissolved oxygen and nutrients) over an annual hydrological cycle in three freshwater compartments within the watershed: (i) glacial rivers; (ii) active layer thaw-fed streams and waterbodies and (iii) Lake Hazen, into which (i) and (ii) drain. Microbial communities throughout these freshwater compartments were strongly interconnected, hydrologically, and often correlated with the presence of melt-sourced chemicals (e.g. dissolved inorganic carbon) as the melt season progressed. Within Lake Hazen itself, water column microbial communities were generally stable over spring and summer, despite fluctuating lake physicochemistry, indicating that these communities and the potential ecosystem services they provide therein may be resilient to environmental change.

While several studies have targeted the prokaryotic sand filter communities, little is known about the eukaryotic communities, despite the obvious need for knowledge of microorganisms that get in contact with human drinking water. With a new general eukaryotic primer set (18S, V1-V3 region), we performed FLX-454 sequencing of material from 21 waterworks sand filters varying in age (3-40 years) and geographical location on a 250 km east-west axis in Denmark, and put the data in context of their previously published prokaryotic communities. We find that filters vary highly in trophic complexity depending on age, from simple systems with bacteria and protozoa (3-6 years) to complex, mature systems with nematodes, rotifers and turbellarians as apex predators (40 years). Unlike the bacterial communities, the eukaryotic communities display a clear distance-decay relationship that predominates over environmental variations, indicating that the underlying aquifers feeding the filters harbor distinct eukaryotic communities with limited dispersal in between.

This study characterizes chemosynthetic biotopes at active hydrothermal vents discovered at the Kemp Caldera in the South Sandwich Arc. The caldera hosts sulfur and anhydrite vent chimneys in 1375-1487 m depth, which emit sulfide-rich fluids with temperatures up to 212 degrees C, and the microbial community of water samples in the buoyant plume rising from the vents was dominated by sulfur-oxidizing Gammaproteobacteria. A total of 12 macro- and megafaunal taxa depending on hydrothermal activity were collected in these biotopes, of which seven species were known from the East Scotia Ridge (ESR) vents and three species from vents outside the Southern Ocean. Faunal assemblages were dominated by large vesicomyid clams, actinostolid anemones, Sericosura sea spiders and lepetodrilid and cocculinid limpets, but several taxa abundant at nearby ESR hydrothermal vents were rare such as the stalked barnacle Neolepas scotiaensis. Multivariate analysis of fauna at Kemp Caldera and vents in neighbouring areas indicated that the Kemp Caldera is most similar to vent fields in the previously established Southern Ocean vent biogeographic province, showing that the species composition at island-arc hydrothermal vents can be distinct from nearby seafloor-spreading systems. delta C-13 and delta N-15 isotope values of megafaunal species analysed from the Kemp Caldera were similar to those of the same or related species at other vent fields, but none of the fauna sampled at Kemp Caldera had delta C-13 values, indicating nutritional dependence on Epsilonproteobacteria, unlike fauna at other island-arc hydrothermal vents.",2019,6,10.1098/rsos.191501

However, there is an obvious demand to pick out the best performing metaheuristics that are expected to be permanent.

However, the relative importance of different biotic and abiotic factors in determining the bacterial community has not been properly clarified. In this study, the effects of inocula and recipients on the assembly of the soil community were investigated to evaluate their importance by inoculation experiments with sterile soil. Two distinct soils, conventional nitrogen-fertilized soil and aromatic-compound-contaminated soil, were sterilized, cross inoculated, and incubated for 2 months under different inoculation doses and oxygen conditions. The results showed that the greatest variation in community structure emerged in the samples inoculated with distinct inocula rather than in the samples of different soil recipients. The phylogenies in the two inocula were diverse and dissimilar, although there were many ecologically equivalent bacteria. When the inocula with dissimilar ecologically equivalent species were used, the assembled communities were primarily determined by the inocula as indicated by the beta diversity and variation partitioning analyses. In contrast, environmental selection dominated the process when ecologically equivalent species in the inocula were similar, as when only one type of inoculum was used, where the soil habitat selected the most adaptive bacteria from the defined inoculum pool. These results indicate that inoculated bacteria are dominant over environmental selection if they are sufficiently dissimilar, although the effect of environmental selection is more obvious when similar bacteria are inoculated in the soil for community assembly. Our findings suggest that the immigration of exotic bacteria could be a primary factor impacting community assembly. IMPORTANCE The soil microbiota conducts important biological ecosystem functions, but the mechanism underlying community-environment interactions for soil microbiota remains unclear. By using two distinct soils for cross inoculation, we successfully simulated the assembly of the bacterial community in sterile soil. Thus, the reasons why inoculum and recipient have dominated community assembly in previous investigations are investigated in this study. We found that inoculated bacteria presided over environmental selection for community assembly due to the varied difference of ecological equivalent bacteria, either divergent or convergent. The significance of neutrality for the ecologically equivalent bacterial species that immigrated into the recipients should be emphasized in exploring the mechanisms of community assembly. Our finding is helpful for understanding the community- environment interaction, a basic question in ecology, and it would shed light on this issue that has perplexed scientists for many years.",2019,4,10.1128/mSystems.00496-19

The distribution and biogeography of these ammonia oxidizers might be distinctive in high-elevation rivers, which are generally characterized by low temperature and low ammonium concentration but strong solar radiation; however, these characteristics have rarely been documented. This study explored the abundance, community, and activity of ammonia oxidizers in the overlying water of five rivers in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). Potential nitrification rates in these rivers ranged from 5.4 to 38.4 nmol N liter(-1) h(-1), and they were significantly correlated with ammonium concentration rather than temperature. Comammox were found in 25 of the total 28 samples, and they outnumbered AOA in three samples. Contrary to most studied low-elevation rivers, average AOB amoA gene abundance was significantly higher than that of AOA, and AOB/AOA ratios increased with decreasing water temperature. The Simpson index of the AOA community increased with elevation (P < 0.05), and AOA and AOB communities exhibited high dissimilarities with low-elevation rivers. Cold-adapted (Nitrosospira amoA cluster 1, 33.6%) and oligotrophic (Nitrosomonas amoA cluster 6a, 31.7%) groups accounted for large proportions in the AOB community. Suspended sediment concentration exerted significant effects on ammonia oxidizer abundance (r > 0.56), and owing to their elevational variations in source and concentration, suspended sediments facilitated distance-decay patterns for AOA and AOB community similarities. This study demonstrates distinctive biogeography and distribution patterns for ammonia oxidizers in high-elevation rivers of the QTP. Extensive research should be conducted to explore the role of these microbes in the nitrogen cycle of this zone. IMPORTANCE Ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB) as well as co-mammox contribute to ammonia oxidation, which plays significant roles in riverine nitrogen cycle and N2O production. Source regions of numerous rivers in the world lie in high-elevation zones, but the abundance, community, and activity of ammonia oxidizers in rivers in high-elevation regions have rarely been investigated. This study revealed distinctive distribution patterns and community structures for ammonia oxidizers in five high-elevation rivers of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and the individual and combined effects of low temperature, low nutrients, and strong solar radiation on ammonia oxidizers were elucidated. The findings of this study are helpful to broaden our knowledge on the biogeography and distribution pattern of ammonia oxidizers in river systems. Moreover, this study provides some implications to predict the performance of ammonia oxidizers in high-elevation rivers and its variations under global climate warming.",2019,85,10.1128/AEM.01701-19

However, when compared with the northern Mid-Atlantic Ridge (NMAR), the SMAR has not been extensively explored. In particular, there is little information on the vent ecology, with no comprehensive ecological surveys conducted along the SMAR south of 10 degrees S. In 2011, a new hydrothermal vent field, named Deyin-1, was discovered on the SMAR at 15.17 degrees S. In this study, we recorded hydrothermal vent fauna and microbial diversity in both the hydrothermal plumes and deposits of Deyin-1. The biodiversity and distribution of the vent inhabitants were surveyed by phylogenetic analysis, high-throughput pyrosequencing, and in situ observation using a remotely operated vehicle. Results showed that the predominant primary consumers were shrimp (Rimicaris exoculate), crabs (Segonzacia maatlantica), and Bathymodiolus-like mussels, in addition to the common vent predators Macrouridae fish (Cetonurus globiceps), eelpout-like fish, and suspected octopuses. Phylogenetic analysis based on the mitochondria cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene and nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis based on the vent fauna occurrence data revealed that the Deyin-1 vent fauna was closely related to species found on the NMAR. Sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (SOB) of the SUP05 Glade and ammonia-oxidizing archaea belonging to the phylum Thaumarchaeota dominated the vent plume microbial community. Putative thermophilic hydrogenoxidizing chemo-lithoautotrophs, including those belonging to archaeal genera Archaeogiobus and Methanocaldococcus and bacterial genera Desulfurobacterium and Nautilia, dominated the active chimney community, as well as a putative hyperthermophilic sulfur-reducing chemo-organoheterotroph belonging to archaeal genus Thermococcus. While Sulfurovum SOB constituted the predominant episymbionts of the vent shrimp.

Here, microbial communities were characterized for 29 sites across multiple years in >700 samples. The composition of the seafloor microbiome was broadly consistent across the region and was well approximated by the overlying water depth and depth within the sediment column, while geographic distance played a limited role. Biogeographical distributions were employed to generate predictive models for over 4000OTU that leverage easy-to-obtain geospatial variables which are linked to measured sedimentary oxygen profiles. Depth stratification and putative niche diversification are evidenced by the distribution of taxa that mediate the microbial nitrogen cycle. Furthermore, these results demonstrate that sediments impacted by the DWH spill had returned to near baseline conditions after 2years. The distributions of benthic microorganisms in the Gulf can be constrained, and moreover, deviations from these predictions may pinpoint impacted sites and aid in future response efforts or long-term stability studies.",2019,21,10.1111/1462-2920.14794

However, the distribution of fungal communities in the ocean, especially the vertical distribution along depth in the water column, remained poorly understood. Here, we assess the depth-related distribution pattern of fungal communities along the water column from epi- to abyssopelagic zones of the Western Pacific Ocean using internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) metabarcoding. Majority of the assigned OTUs were affiliated to Ascomycota, followed by three other minor phyla (Basidiomycota, Chytridiomycota, and Mucoromycota). The epipelagic zone harbored a higher OTU richness with distinct fungal communities as compared with meso-, bathy-, and abyssopelagic zones. Across the whole water column, depth appears as a key parameter for both fungal alpha- and beta-diversity. However, when the dataset was split into the upper (5-500 m) and deeper (below 500 m) layers, no significant correlation was observed between depth and community compositions. In the upper layer, temperature and dissolved oxygen were recognized as the primary environmental factors shaping fungal alpha- and beta- diversity. By parsing fungal OTUs into ecological categories, multi-trophic mode of nutrition was found to be more prevalent with increasing depth, suggesting a potential adaptation to the extreme conditions of the deep sea. This study provides new and meaningful information on the depth-stratified fungal diversity, community structure, and putative ecological roles in the open sea.",2019,78,10.1007/s00248-019-01374-y

However, several different cotton-strip assays are routinely used, complicating the interpretation of results across studies, and hindering broader synthesis. Here, we compare the decay rates and assemblages of bacteria and fungi colonizing the three most commonly used cotton materials: Artists canvas, Calico cloth, and Empa fabric. Cotton strips from each material type were incubated in 10 streams that span a wide range of physicochemical properties across five ecoregions. Additionally, to evaluate responses to environmental stress without potentially confounding biogeographical effects, we deployed identical bioassays in five streams across an acidification gradient within a single ecoregion. Across all streams decomposition rates (as tensile strength loss [TSL]) differed among the three cotton materials; Calico cloth decomposed fastest (time to 50% TSL [T-50] = 16.7 d), followed by the Empa fabric (T-50 = 18.3 d) and then Artists canvas (T-50 = 21.4 d). Despite these differences, rates of TSL of the three cotton materials responded consistently to variation in environmental conditions; TSL of each fabric increased with stream temperature, dissolved-nutrient concentrations and acid-neutralizing capacity, although Artists canvas and Calico cloth were more sensitive than Empa fabric. Microbial communities were similar among the materials, and values of community structure (e.g., phylotype richness and diversity) were comparable to those reported for decaying leaves in streams from the same region, the major natural basal carbon resource in forested-stream ecosystems. We present linear calibrations among pairs of assays so that past and future studies can be expressed in a common currency (e.g., Artists-fabric equivalents) past and future studies repeated two times in the sentence. Lastly, given its relatively low within-site variability, and the large number of streams where it has been used ( > 700 across the globe), we recommend Artists fabric for future work. These results show that cotton provides an effective and realistic standardized substrate for studying heterotrophic microbial assemblages, and acts as a reasonable proxy for more chemically complex forms of detritus. These findings add to growing evidence that cotton-strip bioassays are simple, effective and easily standardized indicators of heterotrophic microbial activity and the ecosystem processes that result.",2019,106,10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.105466

However, whether this niche segregation is maintained under field conditions in terrestrial ecosystems remains unresolved, particularly at the global scale. We hypothesized that perennial vegetation might favor AOB vs. AOA communities compared with adjacent open areas devoid of perennial vegetation (i.e., bare soil) via several mechanisms, including increasing the amount of ammonium in soil. To test this niche-differentiation hypothesis, we conducted a global field survey including 80 drylands from 6 continents. Data supported our hypothesis, as soils collected under plant canopies had higher levels of ammonium, as well as higher richness (number of terminal restriction fragments; T-RFs) and abundance (qPCR amoA genes) of AOB, and lower richness and abundance of AOA, than those collected in open areas located between plant canopies. Some of the reported associations between plant canopies and AOA and AOB communities can be a consequence of the higher organic matter and available N contents found under plant canopies. Other aspects of soils associated with vegetation including shading and microclimatic conditions might also help explain our results. Our findings provide strong evidence for niche differentiation between AOA and AOB communities in drylands worldwide, advancing our understanding of their ecology and biogeography at the global scale.",2019,13,10.1038/s41396-019-0465-1
"Cobian, GM; Egan, CP; Amend, AS",Plant-microbe specificity varies as a function of elevation,ISME JOURNAL,"Specialized associations between interacting species fundamentally determine the diversity and distribution of both partners. How the specialization of guilds of organisms varies along environmental gradients underpins popular theories of biogeography and macroecology, whereas the degree of specialization of a species is typically considered fixed. However, the extent to which environmental context impacts specialization dynamics is seldom examined empirically. In this study, we examine how specialization within a bipartite network consisting of three co-occurring plant species and their foliar fungal endophyte symbionts changes along a 1000-meter elevation gradient where host species were held constant. The gradient, along the slope of Mauna Loa shield volcano, represents almost the entire elevational range of two of the three plants. Network and plant specialization values displayed a parabolic relationship with elevation, and were highest at middle elevations, whereas bipartite associations were least specific at low and high elevations. Shannons diversity of fungal endophytes correlated negatively with specificity, and was highest at the ends of the transects. Although plant host was a strong determinant of fungal community composition within sites, fungal species turnover was high among sites. There was no evidence of spatial or elevational patterning in fungal community compositon. Our work demonstrates that specificity can be a plastic trait, which is influenced by the environment and centrality of the host within its natural range.",2019,13,10.1038/s41396-019-0470-4

Here we address this issue with an abundance-manipulation experiment that was conducted in a semiarid grassland. We manually increased the abundance of six randomly chosen resident bacterial species in separate, closed, communities and allowed the communities to recover in situ for 1 year. The single episode of increase in the abundance of different species drove species-specific community divergence accompanied by a decline in local diversity. Four of the six added species caused a decrease in the abundance of their closely related species, suggesting an important role of interspecific competition in driving the observed community divergence. Our results also suggested a lack of effective population regulations to force the relative abundance of manipulated species to revert to original level, which would allow persistence of the divergence among soil bacterial communities. We concluded that biotic interactions were important in determining soil bacterial community composition, which could result in substantial variation in soil bacterial community composition in abiotically homogenous environment.",2019,13,10.1038/s41396-019-0477-x

Here, we explored the response patterns of abundant and rare bacterial taxa to disturbances by invasive plant growth and oil contamination in agricultural soils across a large spatial scale (latitude gradient = 18.62 degrees-46.51 degrees). Our meta-analysis based on existing Illumina sequencing datasets showed that abundant taxa persisted under the disturbances whereas rare taxa were more easily affected, indicating the higher resilience or resistance of abundant taxa to disturbances. The responses of abundant taxa were associated with mean annual temperature at the sampling sites, while rare taxa instead showed stochastic responses. There were significantly negative linear regressions between bacterial alpha-diversity and community dissimilarities (disturbed vs. undisturbed soils), suggesting stronger resilience or resistance in those bacterial communities with higher alpha-diversity. This resilience or resistance was mainly associated with the alpha-diversity of abundant taxa. Our network analysis showed that the disturbances substantially decreased the strength of the connections, loosened the co occurrence relationships, and reshaped the complex bacterial interactions. In the undisturbed soils, abundant taxa were located in central positions within the network more often than were rare taxa, while these trends were reversed in the disturbed soils. Our results suggest that abundant taxa play a dominant role in the stability and maintenance of agro-soil bacterial communities, while rare taxa could greatly influence local bacterial interactions under environmental disturbances.

Rhodnius pallescens is a major vector of Chagas disease in Panama. Understanding the microbial ecology of disease vectors is important in the development of vector management strategies that target vector survival and fitness. In this study we examined the whole-body microbial composition of R. pallescens from three locations in Panama. Methods: We collected 89 R. pallescens specimens using Noireau traps in Attalea butyracea palms. We then extracted total DNA from whole-bodies of specimens and amplified bacterial microbiota using 16S rRNA metabarcoding PCR. The 16S libraries were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq and analyzed using QIIME2 software. Results: We found Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes to be the most abundant bacterial phyla across all samples. Geographical location showed the largest difference in microbial composition with northern Veraguas Province having the most diversity and Panama Oeste Province localities being most similar to each other. Wolbachia was detected in high abundance (48-72%) at Panama Oeste area localities with a complete absence of detection in Veraguas Province. No significant differences in microbial composition were detected between triatomine age class, primary blood meal source, or T. cruzi infection status. Conclusions: We found biogeographical regions differ in microbial composition among R. pallescens populations in Panama. While overall the microbiota has bacterial taxa consistent with previous studies in triatomine microbial ecology, locality differences are an important observation for future studies.

Streptomyces densities can vary across the landscape, and inhibitory phenotypes are often a result of selection mediated by microbial competitive interactions in soil communities. Diverse environmental factors, including those specific to habitat, are likely to determine microbial densities in the soil and the outcomes of microbial species interactions. Here, we characterized indigenous Streptomyces densities and inhibitory phenotypes from soil samples (n = 82) collected in 6 distinct habitats across the Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve (CCESR; agricultural, prairie, savanna, wetland, wet-woodland, and forest). Significant variation in Streptomyces density and the frequency of antagonistic Streptomyces were observed among habitats. There was also significant variation in soil chemical properties among habitats, including percent carbon, percent nitrogen, available phosphorus, extractable potassium, and pH. Density and frequency of antagonists were significantly correlated with one or more environmental parameters across all habitats, though relationships with some parameters differed among habitats. In addition, we found that habitat rather than spatial proximity was a better predictor of variation in Streptomyces density and inhibitory phenotypes. Moreover, habitats least conducive for Streptomyces growth and proliferation, as determined by population density, had increased frequencies of inhibitory phenotypes. Identifying environmental parameters that structure variation in density and frequency of antagonistic Streptomyces can provide insight for determining factors that mediate selection for inhibitory phenotypes across the landscape.",,,10.1007/s00248-019-01443-2

In these ecosystems, bacteria and archaea can oxidize the released iron and therefore play an important role in the biogeochemical cycles of essential nutrients. These organisms often form microbial mats, and the primary producers in these communities can support diverse higher trophic levels. One such class of bacteria are the Zetaproteobacteria. This class of bacteria oxidize iron and commonly produce extracellular iron oxyhydroxide matrices that provide architecture to the microbial mats, so they are considered foundational members of the community and ecosystem engineers. Zetaproteobacteria are responsible for the majority of iron-oxidation in circumneutral, marine, low-oxygen environments. To study the composition of these communities, microbial mats were collected using a biomat sampler, which allows for fine-scale collection of microbial mats. DNA was then extracted and amplified for analysis of the SSU rRNA gene. After quality control and filtering, the SSU rRNA genes from Mariana Arc and Loihi Seamount microbial mat communities were compared pairwise to determine which site exhibits a greater microbial diversity and how much community overlap exists between the two sites. In-depth analysis was performed with the rule-based microbial network (RMN) algorithm, which identified a possible competitive relationship across oligotypes of a cosmopolitan Zetaproteobacteria operational taxonomic unit (OTU). This result demonstrated the ecological relevance of oligotypes, or fine-scale OTU variants. The oligotype distributions of the cosmopolitan ZetaOTUs varied greatly across the Pacific Ocean. The competitive relationship between dominant oligotypes at Loihi Seamount and the Mariana Arc and back-arc may be driving their differential distributions across the two regions and may result in species divergence within a cosmopolitan ZetaOTU. This implementation of the RMN algorithm can both predict directional relationships within a community and provide insight to the level at which evolution is occurring across ecosystems.",2019,10,10.3389/fmicb.2019.02389

Through high-throughput 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing, distinguishable patterns were retrieved between habitats. In particular, community composition was more similar between the two zooplankton taxa, between the two water depths, and was rather different in sediments, where a large fraction of the total diversity was present. Most bacterial taxa were restricted to one or few habitats, whereas only few were found as generalists on different habitats. Our results indicate a limited role of source-sink dynamics between habitats for aquatic bacteria. Similarly to patterns of diversity in larger organisms, community composition was different between habitats, potentially because of specific mechanisms creating and maintaining habitat filtering.",2020,847,10.1007/s10750-019-04068-1

Further, all components of the microeukaryotic communities (including total, dominant, always rare, and conditionally rare taxa) exhibited a significant distance-decay pattern in both seasons, and these communities had a stronger distance-decay relationship during the dry season, especially for the conditionally rare taxa. Although several variables had a significant influence on the microeukaryotic communities, the environmental and spatial factors showed minor roles in shaping the communities. Importantly, these microeukaryotic communities were strongly driven by stochastic processes, with 89.9%, 88.5%, and 89.6% of the community variation explained by neutral community model during wet, dry, and both seasons, respectively. The neutral community model also explained a large fraction of the community variation across different taxonomic groups and levels. Additionally, the microeukaryotic taxa, which were above and below the neutral prediction, were ecologically and taxonomically distinct groups, which might be interactively structured by deterministic and stochastic processes. Conclusions This study demonstrated that stochastic processes are sufficient in shaping substantial variation in river microeukaryotic metacommunity across different hydrographic regimes, thereby providing a better understanding of spatiotemporal patterns, processes, and mechanisms of microeukaryotic community in waters.",2019,7,10.1186/s40168-019-0749-8

Here, we describe the first systematic study of an archaeal plasmid family, the pT26-2 plasmid family. The in-depth analysis of the distribution, biogeography and host-plasmid co-evolution patterns of 26 integrated and 3 extrachromosomal plasmids of this plasmid family shows that they are widespread in Thermococcales and Methanococcales isolated from around the globe but are restricted to these two orders. All members of the family share seven core genes but employ different integration and replication strategies. Phylogenetic analysis of the core genes and CRISPR spacer distribution suggests that plasmids of the pT26-2 family evolved with their hosts independently in Thermococcales and Methanococcales, despite these hosts exhibiting similar geographic distribution. Remarkably, core genes are conserved even in integrated plasmids that have lost replication genes and/or replication origins suggesting that they may be beneficial for their hosts. We hypothesize that the core proteins encode for a novel type of DNA/protein transfer mechanism, explaining the widespread oceanic distribution of the pT26-2 plasmid family.",2019,21,10.1111/1462-2920.14800

However, the direction and magnitude of this feedback remain highly uncertain due largely to our limited understanding of the spatial heterogeneity of soil C decomposition and its temperature sensitivity. Here we quantified C decomposition and its response to temperature change with an incubation study of soils from 203 sites across tropical to boreal forests in China spanning a wide range of latitudes (18 degrees 16  to 51 degrees 37  N) and longitudes (81 degrees 01  to 129 degrees 28  E). Mean annual temperature (MAT) and mean annual precipitation primarily explained the biogeographic variation in the decomposition rate and temperature sensitivity of soils: soil C decomposition rate decreased from warm and wet forests to cold and dry forests, while Q(10-MAT) (standardized to the MAT of each site) values displayed the opposite pattern. In contrast, biological factors (i.e. plant productivity and soil bacterial diversity) and soil factors (e.g. clay, pH, and C availability of microbial biomass C and dissolved organic C) played relatively small roles in the biogeographic patterns. Moreover, no significant relationship was found between Q(10-MAT) and soil C quality, challenging the current C quality-temperature hypothesis. Using a single, fixed Q(10-MAT) value (the mean across all forests), as is usually done in model predictions, would bias the estimated soil CO2 emissions at a temperature increase of 3.0 degrees C. This would lead to overestimation of emissions in warm biomes, underestimation in cold biomes, and likely significant overestimation of overall C release from soil to the atmosphere. Our results highlight that climate-related biogeographic variation in soil C responses to temperature needs to be included in next-generation C cycle models to improve predictions of C-climate feedbacks.",2020,26,10.1111/gcb.14838

Despite their importance, there is virtually no knowledge about bioaerosols emitted by pristine forests. Here we provide the very first survey of the prokaryotic community of a bioaerosol collected inside pristine Amazon forest at 2 m above ground. Total atmospheric particles were collected at the Amazon Tall Tower Observatory, subjected to metagenomic DNA extraction and the prokaryotic diversity was determined by 16S rRNA gene ampl icon sequencing. A total of 271,577 reads of 250 bp of the 16S rRNA gene amplicon were obtained. Only 27% of the reads could be classified using the 165 SILVA database. Most belonged to Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Firmicutes which is in good agreement with other bioaerosol studies. Further inspection of the reads using Blast searches and the 18S SILVA database revealed that most of the dataset was composed of Fungi sequences.

"Jiao, S; Lu, YH",Soil pH and temperature regulate assembly processes of abundant and rare bacterial communities in agricultural ecosystems,ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY,"The factors determining stochastic and deterministic processes that drive microbial community structure, specifically the balance of abundant and rare bacterial taxa, remain underexplored. Here we examined biogeographic patterns of abundant and rare bacterial taxa and explored environmental factors influencing their community assembly processes in agricultural fields across eastern China. More phylogenetic turnover correlating with spatial distance was observed in abundant than rare sub-communities. Homogeneous selection was the main assembly process for both the abundant and rare sub-communities; however, the abundant sub-community was more tightly clustered phylogenetically and was more sensitive to dispersal limitations than the rare sub-community. Rare sub-community of rice fields and abundant sub-community of maize fields were more governed by stochastic assembly processes, which showed higher operational taxonomic unit richness. We propose a conceptual paradigm wherein soil pH and mean annual temperature mediate the assembly of the abundant and rare sub-communities respectively. A higher soil pH leads to deterministic assembly of the abundant sub-community. For the rare sub-community, the dominance of stochasticity in low-temperature regions indicates weaker niche-based exclusion and the arrival of more evolutionary lineages. These findings suggest that the community assembly processes for abundant and rare bacterial taxa are dependent on distinct environmental variables in agro-ecosystems.",2020,22,10.1111/1462-2920.14815

However, there is significant heterogeneity in salinity influences on TAI soil biogeochemical function. This heterogeneity is perhaps related to unrecognized mechanisms associated with carbon (C) chemistry and microbial communities. To investigate this potential, we evaluated hypotheses associated with salinity-associated shifts in organic C thermodynamics; biochemical transformations; and nitrogen-, phosphorus-, and sulfur-containing heteroatom organic compounds in a first-order coastal watershed on the Olympic Peninsula of Washington, USA. In contrast to our hypotheses, thermodynamic favorability of water-soluble organic compounds in shallow soils decreased with increasing salinity (43-867 mu S cm(-1)), as did the number of inferred biochemical transformations and total heteroatom content. These patterns indicate lower microbial activity at higher salinity that is potentially constrained by accumulation of less-favorable organic C. Furthermore, organic compounds appeared to be primarily marine- or algae-derived in forested floodplain soils with more lipid-like and protein-like compounds, relative to upland soils that had more lignin-, tannin-, and carbohydrate-like compounds. Based on a recent simulation-based study, we further hypothesized a relationship between C chemistry and the ecological assembly processes governing microbial community composition. Null modeling revealed that differences in microbial community composition - assayed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing - were primarily the result of limited exchange of organisms among communities (i.e., dispersal limitation). This results in unstructured demographic events that cause community composition to diverge stochastically, as opposed to divergence in community composition being due to deterministic selection-based processes associated with differences in environmental conditions. The strong influence of stochastic processes was further reflected in there being no statistical relationship between community assembly processes (e.g., the relative influence of stochastic assembly processes) and C chemistry (e.g., heteroatom content). This suggests that microbial community composition does not have a mechanistic or causal linkage to C chemistry. The salinity-associated gradient in C chemistry was, therefore, likely influenced by a combination of spatially structured inputs and salinity-associated metabolic responses of microbial communities that were independent of community composition. We propose that impacts of salinity on coastal soil biogeochemistry need to be understood in the context of C chemistry, hydrologic or depositional dynamics, and microbial physiology, while microbial composition may have less influence.",2019,16,10.5194/bg-16-3911-2019

HGT events often involve mobile genetic elements like plasmids, which can promote their own dissemination by associating with adaptive traits in the gene pool of the so-called mobilome. Novel traits that evolve through HGT can therefore lead to the exploitation of new ecological niches, prompting an adaptive radiation of bacterial species. In this study, we present phylogenetic, biogeographic, and functional analyses of a previously unrecognized RepL-type plasmid found in diverse members of the marine Roseobacter group across the globe. Noteworthy, 100% identical plasmids were detected in phylogenetically and geographically distant bacteria, revealing a so-far overlooked, but environmentally highly relevant vector for HGT. The genomic and functional characterization of this plasmid showed a completely conserved backbone dedicated to replication, stability, and mobilization as well as an interchangeable gene cassette with highly diverse, but recurring motifs. The majority of the latter appear to be involved in mechanisms coping with toxins and/or pollutants in the marine environment. Furthermore, we provide experimental evidence that the plasmid has the potential to be transmitted across bacterial orders, thereby increasing our understanding of evolution and microbial niche adaptation in the environment.",2019,116,10.1073/pnas.1905878116

Most isolated to date infect nonmarine protists, leaving their strategies and prevalence in marine environments largely unknown. Using eukaryotic single-cell metagenomics in the Pacific, we discovered a Mimiviridae lineage of giant viruses, which infects choanoflagellates, widespread protistan predators related to metazoans. The ChoanoVirus genomes are the largest yet from pelagic ecosystems, with 442 of 862 predicted proteins lacking known homologs. They are enriched in enzymes for modifying organic compounds, including degradation of chitin, an abundant polysaccharide in oceans, and they encode 3 divergent type-1 rhodopsins (VirR) with distinct evolutionary histories from those that capture sunlight in cellular organisms. One (VirR(DTS)) is similar to the only other putative rhodopsin from a virus (PgV) with a known host (a marine alga). Unlike the algal virus, ChoanoViruses encode the entire pigment biosynthesis pathway and cleavage enzyme for producing the required chromophore, retinal. We demonstrate that the rhodopsin shared by ChoanoViruses and PgV binds retinal and pumps protons. Moreover, our 1.65-angstrom resolved VirRDTS crystal structure and mutational analyses exposed differences from previously characterized type-1 rhodopsins, all of which come from cellular organisms. Multiple VirR types are present in metagenomes from across surface oceans, where they are correlated with and nearly as abundant as a canonical marker gene from Mimiviridae. Our findings indicate that light-dependent energy transfer systems are likely common components of giant viruses of photosynthetic and phagotrophic unicellular marine eukaryotes.",2019,116,10.1073/pnas.1907517116
"Salmaso, N",Effects of Habitat Partitioning on the Distribution of Bacterioplankton in Deep Lakes,FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY,"In deep lakes, many investigations highlighted the existence of exclusive groups of bacteria adapted to deep oxygenated and hypoxic and anoxic hypolimnia. Nevertheless, the extent of bacterial strain diversity has been much less scrutinized. This aspect is essential for an unbiased estimation of genetic variation, biodiversity, and population structure, which are essential for studying important research questions such as biogeographical patterns, temporal and spatial variability and the environmental factors affecting this variability. This study investigated the bacterioplankton community in the epilimnetic layers and in the oxygenated and hypoxic/anoxic hypolimnia of five large and deep lakes located at the southern border of the Alps using high throughput sequencing (HTS) analyses (16S rDNA) and identification of amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) resolving reads differing by as little as one nucleotide. The study sites, which included two oligomictic (Garda and Como) and three meromictic lakes (Iseo, Lugano, and Idro) with maximum depths spanning from 124 to 410 m, were chosen among large lakes to represent an oxic-hypoxic gradient. The analyses showed the existence of several unique ASVs in the three layers of the five lakes. In the case of cyanobacteria, this confirmed previous analyses made at the level of strains or based on oligotyping methods. As expected, the communities in the hypoxic/anoxic monimolimnia showed a strong differentiation from the oxygenated layer, with the exclusive presence in single lakes of several unique ASVs. In the meromictic lakes, results supported the hypothesis that the formation of isolated monimolimnia sustained the development of highly diversified bacterial communities through ecological selection, leading to the establishment of distinctive biodiversity zones. The genera identified in these layers are well-known to activate a wide range of redox reactions at low O-2 conditions. As inferred from 16S rDNA data, the highly diversified and coupled processes sustained by the monimolimnetic microbiota are essential ecosystem services that enhance mineralization of organic matter and formation of reduced compounds, and also abatement of undesirable greenhouse gasses.",2019,10,10.3389/fmicb.2019.02257

A major gap in our understanding remains the comparison of diversity patterns across a broad spectrum of evolutionarily and functionally diverse organisms, particularly in the marine realm. Here, we aim to narrow this gap by comparing the diversity patterns of free-living microbes and macro-invertebrates across a natural experiment provided by the marine lakes of Palau: geographically discrete and environmentally heterogeneous bodies of seawater with comparable geological and climatic history, and a similar regional species pool. We find contrasting patterns of alpha-diversity but remarkably similar patterns of beta-diversity between microbial and macro-invertebrate communities among lakes. Pairwise dissimilarities in community composition among lakes are positively correlated between microbes and macro-invertebrates, and influenced to a similar degree by marked gradients in oxygen concentration and salinity. Our findings indicate that a shared spatio-temporal and environmental context may result in parallel patterns of beta-diversity in microbes and macro-invertebrates, in spite of key trait differences between these organisms.

Here we investigated the biogeographic assemblies and co-occurrence patterns of sedimentary bacterial and fungal communities in the Jinsha River, one of the largest rivers in southwestern China. The mainstream of river was divided into upstream, midstream and downstream. The results showed that both bacterial and fungal communities differed significantly among three sections. For both communities, their composition variations in all sites or each river section were controlled by the combination of dispersal limitation and environmental selection, and dispersal limitation was the dominant factor. Compared with bacteria, fungi had stronger dispersal limitation. Co-occurrence network analyses revealed higher network connectivity but a lower proportion of positive interaction in the bacterial than fungal network at all sites. In particular, the keystone species belonging to bacterial phyla Proteobacteria and Firmicutes and fungal phyla Ascomycota and Chytridiomycota may play critical roles in maintaining community function. Together, these observations indicate that fungi have a stronger dispersal limitation influence and less network connectivity than bacteria, implying different community assembly mechanisms and ecological functions between bacteria and fungi in large rivers.",2020,22,10.1111/1462-2920.14795

This study took soil samples from 300 forest plots spanning six forest types along a latitudinal gradient in eastern China, which ranges from tropical rainforest to boreal forest ecosystems. A null-model analysis was used to compare the observed soil fungal beta diversity (beta-diversity) with the beta-diversity expected from random sampling of each local species pool. We also compared the relative importance of environmental and spatial variables on soil fungal beta-diversity among forest types along the latitudinal gradient. Our results found that observed beta-diversity was greater than expected beta-diversity in all six forest types, which means that species tend to be more aggregated than expected. We determined that this species aggregation resulted from both environmental filtering and species dispersal limitations. Further, environmental variables had stronger influences on beta-diversity than spatial dispersions. Additionally, the co-occurrence network showed that more species interactions occurred in the mid-latitude forests which lead to decreased soil fungal beta-diversity and low interpretations of environmental and spatial variables. Study of these processes in different forest types along latitudinal gradients will provide important insights that local differences in the relative importance of different community assembly processes creates different gradients in global biodiversity.",2019,10,10.3390/f10100863

However, only one stygobitic lineage, Speleonerilla nom. nov. (previously known as Longipalpa), seems obligate to this environment.

All species have been collected from the water column of anchialine caves in the Caribbean, Bermuda, and Canary Islands, contrary to their benthic and interstitial nerillid relatives. New species were described combining light, scanning electron, and confocal laser scanning microscopy and named after traditional dances from their corresponding countries.

Therefore, a manipulated microcosm experiment with a gradient of HA amendment was conducted to unveil this. The results showed that common and rare taxa had similar patterns in species richness, while rare taxa exhibited a higher turnover, which caused their higher structural dissimilarity. Common species with wider niche breadths were more strongly influenced by deterministic filtering when compared to rare taxa, which occupied narrow niches and were primarily controlled by stochastic processes. Generally, species with wider niche breadths were always more strongly influenced by deterministic selection.

Results Biofilms were collected across an altitude range of 0 to 860 m asl, occurring from the coast to 60-km inland. A dominant presence of the filamentous terrestrial green alga Trentepohlia umbrina (Kutzing) Bornet was confirmed in all sites sometimes mixed with cyanobacteria of the genus Gloeocapsa. The distribution of Trentepohliales is generally given as pan-tropical, but some species, such as T. umbrina, are also distributed in temperate climates. Here, it is reported for the first time a Mediterranean occurrence of the species. Low humidity and light conditions, such as those occurring on vertical surfaces with mainly northern aspects, are the preferred environmental conditions. Coastal areas were more favourable for its growth, probably due to the higher nocturnal condensation that occurs here. Concrete and mortars were particularly bioreceptive to T. umbrina, but marble and trachyte were also colonised under favourable conditions. Conclusions The findings better define the ecological range of this species, suggesting a wider biogeographic distribution, and adding information on morphological features and genetic data.",2019,69,10.1007/s13213-019-01472-9

However, our understanding of how bacteria are transported through these same networks is limited. Here, we applied 16S rRNA gene sequencing to over 500 soil, stream water and stream sediment samples collected within a native forest catchment to determine the extent to which bacterial communities in these habitats are connected. We provide evidence that while the bacterial communities in each habitat were significantly distinct from one another (PERMANOVA pairwise P < 0.001), the bacterial communities in soil and stream samples were weakly connected to each other when stream sediment sample locations were downhill of surface runoff flow paths. This pattern decreased with increasing distance between the soil and sediment samples. The connectivity between soil and stream water samples was less apparent and extremely transient; the greatest similarity between bacterial communities in soil and stream water overall was when comparing stream samples collected 1 week post soil sampling. This study shows how bacterial communities in soil, stream water and stream sediments are connected at small spatial scales and provides rare insights into the temporal dynamics of terrestrial and aquatic bacterial community connectivity.",2020,22,10.1111/1462-2920.14792

However, the impact of long-term conservation pasture management on soil microbial communities remains unclear. Therefore, soil microbiome responses to conservation pasture management is an important component of soil health, especially in the largest agricultural land-use in the US. The aim of this study was to identify soil microbiome community differences following 13-years of pasture management (hayed (no cattle), continuously grazed, rotationally grazed with a fenced, un-grazed and unfertilized buffer strip, and a control (no poultry litter or cattle manure inputs)). Since 2004, all pastures (excluding the control) received annual poultry litter at a rate of 5.6 Mg ha(-1). Soil samples were collected at a 0-15 cm depth from 2016-017 either pre or post poultry litter applications, and bacterial communities were characterized using Illumina 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Overall, pasture management influenced soil microbial community structure, and effects were different by year (P < 0.05). Soils receiving no poultry litter or cattle manure had the lowest richness (Chao). Continuously grazed systems had greater (P < 0.05) soil community richness, which corresponded with greater soil pH and nutrients. Consequently, continuously grazed systems may increase soil diversity, owing to continuous nutrient-rich manure deposition; however, this management strategy may adversely affect aboveground plant communities and water quality. These results suggest conservation pasture management (e.g., rotationally grazed systems) may not improve microbial diversity, albeit, buffer strips were reduced nutrients and bacterial movement as evident by low diversity and fertility in these areas compared to areas with manure or poultry litter inputs. Overall, animal inputs (litter or manure) increased soil microbiome diversity and may be a mechanism for improved soil health.",2019,7,10.7717/peerj.7839

The microbiota colonizing the endophytic compartment (endorhizosphere) and the rhizosphere contribute to productivity, plant growth, phytoremediation and carbon sequestration. The main objective of this study was to investigate how fungal communities are enriched in different habitats outside and inside of grapevine roots. For this purpose, the spatial dynamics of the fungal communities associated with three soil-plant compartments (bulk soil, rhizosphere and endorhizosphere) were characterized by ITS high-throughput amplicon sequencing (HTAS). Fungal communities were largely affected in their diversity and composition by soil-plant compartments, whereas the spatial variation (i.e. across five vineyards) was low. The endorhizosphere compartment differed most from the other two, suggesting that the root tissues entail a barrier for fungal colonization. The results of functional prediction via FUNGuild suggested an increase in the relative abundances of potential plant pathogens, endophytes and arbuscular mycorrhiza, and a decrease in wood, dung and undefined saprotrophs from bulk soil towards the endorhizosphere. Roots of asymptomatic vines were a microbial niche that is inhabited by soilborne fungi associated with grapevine trunk diseases, which opens up new perspectives in the study of the endophytic role of these pathogens on grapevines. Results obtained in this study provide helpful information to better know how the host shapes its microbiome and the implications for vineyard productivity and management.

Vibrio parahaemolyticus is found in warm coastal waters and causes gastroenteritis in humans and economically significant disease in shrimps. Based on data from 1103 genomes of environmental and clinical isolates, we show that V. parahaemolyticus is divided into four diverse populations, VppUS1, VppUS2, VppX and VppAsia. The first two are largely restricted to the US and Northern Europe, while the others are found worldwide, with VppAsia making up the great majority of isolates in the seas around Asia. Patterns of diversity within and between the populations are consistent with them having arisen by progressive divergence via genetic drift during geographical isolation. However, we find that there is substantial overlap in their current distribution. These observations can be reconciled without requiring genetic barriers to exchange between populations if long-range dispersal has increased dramatically in the recent past. We found that VppAsia isolates from the US have an average of 1.01% more shared ancestry with VppUS1 and VppUS2 isolates than VppAsia isolates from Asia itself. Based on time calibrated trees of divergence within epidemic lineages, we estimate that recombination affects about 0.017% of the genome per year, implying that the genetic mixture has taken place within the last few decades. These results suggest that human activity, such as shipping, aquatic products trade and increased human migration between continents, are responsible for the change of distribution pattern of this species.",2019,13,10.1038/s41396-019-0461-5

Evidence from regional scale studies suggests that foliar fungal symbiont distributions are influenced both by plant hosts and environmental variation in climate and soil resources. However, previous surveys have focused on either one plant host across an environmental gradient or one gradient and multiple plant hosts, making it difficult to disentangle the influence of host identity from the influence of the environment on foliar endophyte communities. We used a culture-based approach to survey fungal symbiont composition in the leaves of nine C-3 grass species along replicated elevation gradients in grasslands of the Colorado Rocky Mountains. In these ecosystems, the taxonomic richness and composition of foliar fungal symbionts were mostly structured by the taxonomic identity of the plant host rather than by variation in climate. Plant traits related to size (height and leaf length) were the best predictors of foliar fungal symbiont composition and diversity, and composition did not vary predictably with plant evolutionary history. The largest plants had the most diverse and distinctive fungal communities. These results suggest that across the similar to 300 m elevation range that we sampled, foliar fungal symbionts may indirectly experience climate change by tracking the shifting distributions of plant hosts rather than tracking climate directly.",2019,78,10.1007/s00248-019-01336-4

Associated microbial communities, in particular, eukaryotes, play significant roles in nutrient fixation and turnover. In order to understand better the ecological processes driven by these organisms, the first step is to characterise these associated organisms. We characterised the taxonomic diversity, and from this, inferred the functional diversity of microeukaryotes in Sphagnum mosses in tropical, subtropical and temperate climatic zones through an environmental DNA diversity metabarcoding survey of the V9 region of the gene coding for the RNA of the small subunit of the ribosomes (SSU rRNA). As microbial processes are strongly driven by temperatures, we hypothesised that saprotrophy would be highest in warm regions, whereas mixotrophy, an optimal strategy in oligotrophic environments, would peak under colder climates. Phylotype richness was higher in tropical and subtropical climatic zones than in the temperate region, mostly due to a higher diversity of animal parasites (i.e. Apicomplexa). Decomposers, and especially opportunistic yeasts and moulds, were more abundant under warmer climates, while mixotrophic organisms were more abundant under temperate climates. The dominance of decomposers, suggesting a higher heterotrophic activity under warmer climates, is coherent with the generally observed faster nutrient cycling at lower latitudes; this phenomenon is likely enhanced by higher inputs of nutrients most probably brought in the system by Metazoa, such as arthropods.",2019,78,10.1007/s00248-019-01325-7

Yet, despite increasing efforts to characterize soil bacterial and fungal assemblages, it is challenging to disentangle the influences of sampling design on assessments of communities. Here, we sought to determine whether composite samples-often analyzed as a low cost and effort alternative to replicated individual samples-provide representative summary estimates of microbial communities. At three Minnesota agricultural research sites planted with an oat cover crop, we conducted amplicon sequencing for soil bacterial and fungal communities (16S(V4) and ITS2) of replicated individual or homogenized composite soil samples. We compared soil microbiota from within and among plots and then among agricultural sites using both sampling strategies. Results indicated that single or multiple replicated individual samples, or a composite sample from each plot, were sufficient for distinguishing broad site-level macroecological differences among bacterial and fungal communities. Analysis of a single sample per plot captured only a small fraction of the distinct OTUs, diversity, and compositional variability detected in the analysis of multiple individual samples or a single composite sample. Likewise, composite samples captured only a fraction of the diversity represented by the six individual samples from which they were formed, and, on average, analysis of two or three individual samples offered greater compositional coverage (i.e., greater number of OTUs) than a single composite sample. We conclude that sampling design significantly impacts estimates of bacterial and fungal communities even in homogeneously managed agricultural soils, and our findings indicate that while either strategy may be sufficient for broad macroecological investigations, composites may be a poor substitute for replicated samples at finer spatial scales.",2019,78,10.1007/s00248-019-01318-6

Across the plot, all bacterial and fungal richness (number of OTUs) and diversity indices (Shannon diversity and phylogenetic diversity) showed strong spatial autocorrelations. Soil microbial richness and diversity indices displayed a unimodal pattern from south to north in the karst forest, with peaks in the low and middle areas of the plot. Slope was found to be the best predictor of soil bacterial and fungal richness and diversity indices. Soil pH was negatively related with bacterial richness, and with bacterial and fungal phylogenetic diversity. Tree Shannon diversity and density together explained much of the variations in fungal OTUs and diversity indices. Spatial factors explained much less of the variation in soil microbial richness and diversity indices than the selected environmental variables, which indicated that habitat heterogeneity rather than dispersal limitation played an important role in soil microbial richness and diversity in the karst forest.

Soil microbial fuel cells (MFCs) can promote the degradation efficiency of contaminants while generating bioelectricity under anaerobic conditions. MFC performance varies amongst different types of soils due to distinctive soil properties. This study assesses the performance of soil MFCs filled with four typical Chinese soils and explores key factors regulating bioelectricity generation and tetracycline degradation. Except for the MFCs filled with black soil, tetracycline degradation rates improved in soil MFCs, particularly in those filled with Chao soil, which enhanced the degradation rate by 39% relative to the corresponding control. Additionally, soil MFCs filled with Chao soil exhibited the highest charge output of 1347 � 357C, which was 100-499% higher than that of MFCs with other soils. According to redundancy analysis, soil particle size, pH, conductivity and dissolved organic carbon content showed positive association with tetracycline degradation and charge output, while the adsorption of tetracycline had a negative association with degradation rate. Thus, the adsorption of tetracycline restricted its removal efficiency in soil MFCs, and high soil conductivity and large particle size promoted electron transfer, enhancing biocurrent intensity, which increased tetracycline degradation efficiency.

Currently, for archived soils, there is a concern whether the spatial differences are still preserved in them after long-term storage. Considering plenty of archived soils being stored by institutions, we tried to explore whether they could provide certain information about microbial biogeography. In the present study, high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene was conducted for archived soil samples, which were collected in different years from four agricultural long-term experimental stations of the Chinese Ecosystem Research Network and had been stored for approximate 1, 6 and 11 years. After processing the raw high-throughput sequencing data, a total of 10,623 OTUs belonging to 46 phyla were detected across all 72 soil samples. The results of OTU analysis showed that the overlap ratio (> 57.35%) of bacterial OTUs between sampling years at the same station was higher than that (< 32.39%) between experimental stations in the same year. Simultaneously, the differences in taxonomic counts among stations in the same sampling year overwhelmed those among sampling years at the same station, and a similar result was observed for bacterial alpha-diversity as well. More importantly, soil bacterial communities were distinctly different among geographic locations (ANOSIM R = 0.997 and p < 0.001), while differed far less among sampling years (R = 0.085, p = 0.005). Altogether, the results from this investigation demonstrated that soils archived for about a decade were still applicable in revealing spatial differences in soil bacterial communities, and these differences were hardly obscured by storage time, suggesting the potential of archived soils in studies on microbial geography.",2019,142,10.1016/j.apsoil.2019.05.021

Here, we analyzed a comprehensive database of marine benthic ciliates found along the coast of China from 1991 to 2018 to examine the geographical patterns in species and trait composition and functional diversity. According to redundancy analysis conducted at large spatial scales, environmental variables, i.e. habitat type and salinity, explained more variance in species composition than latitude. In contrast, trait composition was better explained by spatial and climatic variables. At small spatial scales, both species and trait composition were probably influenced by mass effects due to the high dispersal ability of ciliates at such small scales, resulting in spatially homogenized communities. Several traits, including body size, feeding type and mobility, exhibited significant positive or negative latitudinal gradients. Functional diversity showed a significant positive correlation with latitude between 20 and 40 degrees N, which may be caused by certain groups of ciliates possessing particular traits related to temperature.

Here, an integrative approach, combining high-throughput cDNA sequencing and quantitative protargol stain, was used to analyze ciliate communities collected temporally along a transect from coastal to oceanic regions at depths ranging from the surface to 1000 m. The mesopelagic zone exhibited comparable alpha diversity to surface water which was consistent over temporal variation, with high diversity occurring at the interface with the euphotic zone. Comparison with the northeastern and the western Pacific Ocean revealed consistency of this vertical distribution of ciliates across oceanic basins. Mesopelagic ciliates harbored distinct community structure without significant seasonal differences, with the vertical variations driven largely by members of the classes Spirotrichea and Oligohymenophorea. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) affiliated with Scuticociliatia, Astomatida and Apostomatida, members of which are known to be bacterivorous and/or commensal/parasitic species, were more abundant in mesopelagic waters than above, implying they are an important component of food webs in the mesopelagic zone. A combination of depth, geographic distance and environment shaped the ciliate communities, with depth being the most influential factor. Phylogenetic null modeling analysis further indicated that 57.1 and 33.3% of mesopelagic community variation was governed by dispersal limitation and heterogeneous selection, respectively, probably due to the marked biochemical and physical gradients down the water column. This suggests that ciliate community structure in the mesopelagic zone is mainly controlled by stochastic processes. Collectively, this study reports mesopelagic ciliates exhibited high diversity and distinct community structure across spatiotemporal scales and informs the processes mediating ciliate assembly in the mesopelagic zone.

Within one region, soil and soil water samples were additionally taken from the surrounding watersheds in order to cover the full terrestrial-aquatic continuum. The composition of methanotrophic communities across the boreal landscape showed only a modest degree of regional differentiation but a strong structuring along the hydrologic continuum from soil to lake communities, regardless of regions. This pattern along the hydrologic continuum was mostly explained by a clear niche differentiation between type I and type II methanotrophs along environmental gradients in pH, and methane concentrations. Our results suggest very different roles of type I and type II methanotrophs within inland waters, the latter likely having a terrestrial source and reflecting passive transport and dilution along the aquatic networks, but this is an unresolved issue that requires further investigation.",2019,28,10.1111/mec.15223

Soil microbes are the main driver of biogeochemical cycling in this forest ecosystem and have complex interactions with carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) components in the soil. Results We investigated the vertical soil microbial community structure in a primary Korean pine-broadleaved mixed forest in Changbai Mountain (from 699 to 1177 m) and analyzed the relationship between the microbial community and both C and N components in the soil. The results showed that the total phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) of soil microbes and Gram-negative bacteria (G-), Gram-positive bacteria (G), fungi (F), arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), and Actinomycetes varied significantly (p < 0.05) at different sites (elevations). The ratio of fungal PLFAs to bacterial PLFAs (F/B) was higher at site H1, and H2. The relationship between microbial community composition and geographic distance did not show a distance-decay pattern. The coefficients of variation for bacteria were maximum among different sites (elevations). Total soil organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), soil water content (W), and the ratio of breast-height basal area of coniferous trees to that of broad-leaved tree species (RBA) were the main contributors to the variation observed in each subgroup of microbial PLFAs. The structure equation model showed that TOC had a significant direct effect on bacterial biomass and an indirect effect upon bacterial and fungal biomass via soil readily oxidized organic carbon (ROC). No significant relationship was observed between soil N fraction and the biomass of fungi and bacteria. Conclusion The total PLFAs (tPLFA) and PLFAs of soil microbes, including G-, G, F, AMF, and Actinomycetes, were significantly affected by elevation.

In this study, we aim to identify the efficacy of feces as a gut proxy in birds using chickens as a model. We collected 1,026 samples from 206 chickens, including duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, and feces samples, for 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing analyses. In this study, the efficacy of feces as a gut proxy was partitioned to microbial community membership and community structure. Most taxa in the small intestine (84.11-87.28%) and ceca (99.39%) could be identified in feces. Microbial community membership was reflected with a gut anatomic feature, but community structure was not. Excluding shared microbes, the small intestine and ceca contributed 34.12 and 5.83% of the total fecal members, respectively. The composition of Firmicutes members in the small intestine and that of Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria members in the ceca could be well mirrored by the observations in fecal samples (p = 0.54-0.71 and 0.71-0.78, respectively, P < 0.001). However, there were few significant correlations for each genus between feces and each of the four gut segments, and these correlations were not high (p = -0.2-0.4, P < 0.05) for most genera. Our results suggest that fecal microbial community has a good potential to identify most taxa in the chicken gut and could moderately mirror the microbial structure in the intestine at the microbial population level with phylum specificity.

A 10-year perspective,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"Tadpoles are diverse and abundant consumers, and knowledge of their feeding ecology and trophic status is essential in understanding their functional roles within aquatic habitats. Here we revisit Altig, Whiles, and Taylor (2007)s paper, which highlighted the knowledge gaps in tadpole feeding ecology and the application of modern techniques, such as stable isotope and fatty acid analyses to better quantify dominant food resources, food assimilation, and the trophic status of tadpoles. We reviewed the ecological studies that have been published since 2007 that used stable isotopes and fatty acid analyses, also metagenomics and ecological stoichiometry analyses. We describe the ecological roles of tadpoles in freshwater ecosystems and identify knowledge gaps regarding tadpole feeding ecology across biogeographic regions. Worldwide declines in amphibian abundance and diversity create an urgent need to document their feeding ecology and trophic status. As consumers, tadpoles play important functional roles in nutrient cycling, energy flow, and bioturbation. They also exhibit context-dependent trophic plasticity in response to abiotic and biotic gradients, which complicates understanding of their trophic roles. Most studies of tadpole trophic ecology have been conducted primarily on species from the families Ranidae, Bufonidae, and Hylidae from Neotropic and Nearctic regions, while species in tropical regions such as Africa and Asia lack ecological information for tadpoles. There continues to be a need for studies of tadpole diets and/or trophic ecology in Africa and Southeast Asia regions where species endemism is threated by the growth of anthropogenic activities. The majority of studies have focused on trophic ecology of tadpoles from the perspective of single species or at relatively small spatial and temporal scales. Studies that address questions from an ecosystem perspective were scarce, but are critical for conservation and management.

Despite the ecological significance of bacterial communities, the integrated biogeography of planktonic and sedimentary bacterial communities in response to anthropogenic activities is not adequately understood. Here, we examined environmental parameters and the composition of planktonic and sedimentary bacteria in the Yulin River, a tributary of Three Gorges Reservoir, in response to changes in land use and dam construction. The results revealed that human-induced land use changes enhanced the nutrient concentrations in surface water and dam construction reduced the content of carbon and nitrogen in immediately downstream sediments. Intensified human-dominated land use showed a slight impact on sedimentary bacterial communities but largely reduced the diversity of planktonic bacterial communities. Moreover. human-induced land use changes increased the abundance of genes associated with denitrification, nitrification, and anammox in planktonic bacterial communities by 19.04%, 32.40% and 30.45%, respectively. In dam construction regions, the diversity and nutrient-related metabolic activity of sedimentary bacterial communities immediately downstream of the dam were decreased, whereas these changes were not observed in planktonic bacterial communities. Additionally, bacterial community composition was significantly related to nutrient concentrations variability and followed a distance-decay pattern. Furthermore, environmental effects explained more of the variation in planktonic bacterial community composition as compared with spatial effects did, whereas, sedimentary bacterial communities were more closely related to spatial effects. Our results demonstrated the distinct responses of planktonic and sedimentary bacterial communities to anthropogenic activities, and offered new insight for understanding their potential ecological influence on rivers.

The A pathotype has a broad host spectrum, while A* and A(w) are more restricted both in hosts and in geography. Two previous phylogenomic studies led to contrasting well-supported clades for sequenced genomes of these pathotypes. No extensive biogeographical or divergence dating analytic approaches have been so far applied to available genomes. Results Based on a larger sampling of genomes than in previous studies (including six new genomes sequenced by our group, adding to a total of 95 genomes), phylogenomic analyses resulted in different resolutions, though overall indicating that A  A(W) is the most likely true clade. Our results suggest the high degree of recombination at some branches and the fast diversification of lineages are probable causes for this phylogenetic blurring effect. One of the genomes analyzed, X. campestris pv. durantae, was shown to be an A* strain; this strain has been reported to infect a plant of the family Verbenaceae, though there are no reports of any X. citri subsp. citri pathotypes infecting any plant outside the Citrus genus. Host reconstruction indicated the pathotype ancestor likely had plant hosts in the family Fabaceae, implying an ancient jump to the current Rutaceae hosts. Extensive dating analyses indicated that the origin of X. citri subsp. citri occurred more recently than the main phylogenetic splits of Citrus plants, suggesting dispersion rather than host-directed vicariance as the main driver of geographic expansion. An analysis of 120 pathogenic-related genes revealed pathotype-associated patterns of presence/absence. Conclusions Our results provide novel insights into the evolutionary history of X. citri subsp. citri as well as a sound phylogenetic foundation for future evolutionary and genomic studies of its pathotypes.",2019,20,10.1186/s12864-019-6007-4

While the relationships between biological community structures and ecological functions are a central issue in ecological theory, these relationships remain poorly understood at the large scale. We selected nine forests along the North-South Transect of Eastern China (NSTEC) to determine how plant functional traits influence the latitudinal pattern of soil microbial functions and how soil microbial communities and functions are linked at the regional scale. We found that there was considerable latitudinal variation in the profiles of different substrate use along the NSTEC. Specifically, we found that the substrate use by microorganisms was highest in the temperate forest soils (soil microbial substrate use intensities of 10-12), followed by the subtropical forest soils (soil microbial substrate use intensities of 7-10), and was least in the coniferous forest soils (soil microbial substrate use intensities of 4-7). The latitudinal variation in soil microbial function was more closely related to plant functional traits (leaf dry matter content, leaf C concentrations, and leaf N concentrations, P = 0.002) than climate (mean annual precipitation, P = 0.022). The soil silt, leaf dry matter, and leaf C and N contents were the main controls on the biogeographical patterns of microbial substrate use in these forest soils. The soil microbial community structures and functions were significantly correlated along the NSTEC. Soil carbohydrate and polymer substrate use were mainly related to soil Gram-positive (G()) bacterial and actinomycic phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs), while the use of amine and miscellaneous substrates were related to soil Gram-negative (G(-)) bacterial and fungal PLFAs. The enzyme production varied with changes in the soil microbial communities. The soil enzyme activities were positively correlated with the bacterial PLFAs but were not correlated with the fungal PLFAs. The soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition rates were significantly higher in the temperate forests than in the subtropical and tropical forests, emphasizing the rapid degradability of high-energy substrates such as soil microbial biomass carbon, carbohydrates, and amino acids. The SOM decomposition rates were significantly and negatively related to soil dissolved organic carbon concentrations, carboxylic acids, polymers, and miscellaneous substrate use. The relationships between soil PLFAs and microbial substrate use, enzyme activities, and SOM decomposition rate show that as the soil microbial community structure changes, soil biogeochemical processes also change.",2019,16,10.5194/bg-16-3333-2019

Their extensive diversity challenges emerging operational boundaries defined for microbial species  and complicates efforts of population genetics to study their evolution. Here, we employed single-amino acid variants (SAAVs) to investigate ecological and evolutionary forces that maintain the genomic heterogeneity within ubiquitous SAR11 populations we accessed through metagenomic read recruitment using a single isolate genome. Integrating amino acid and protein biochemistry with metagenomics revealed that systematic purifying selection against deleterious variants governs non-synonymous variation among very closely related populations of SAR11. SAAVs partitioned metagenomes into two main groups matching large-scale oceanic current temperatures, and six finer proteotypes that connect distant oceanic regions.

However, most research has focused on the topsoil, while the subsoil is assumed to have microbial diversity patterns similar to those of the topsoil. Here we compared patterns and drivers of microbial alpha and beta diversity in and between topsoils (0 to 10 cm) and subsoils (30 to 50 cm) of temperate grasslands in Inner Mongolia of China, covering an similar to 1,500-km transect along an aridity gradient. Counter to the conventional assumption, we find contrasting biogeographic patterns of diversity and influencing factors for different bacterial and archaeal groups and between depths. While bacterial diversity remains constant or increases with increasing aridity in topsoil and decreases in subsoil, archaeal diversity decreases in topsoil and remains constant in subsoil. Microbial diversity in the topsoil is most strongly influenced by aboveground vegetation and contemporary climate but is most strongly influenced by the factor historical temperature anomaly since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and by soil pH in the subsoil. Moreover, the biogeographic patterns of topsoil-subsoil community dissimilarities vary for different microbial groups and are overall most strongly influenced by soil fertility differences between depths for bacteria and by contemporary climate for archaea. These findings suggest that diversity patterns observed in the topsoil may not be readily applied to the subsoil horizons. For the subsoil in particular, historical climate plays a vital role in the spatial variation of bacterial diversity. Overall, our study provides novel information for understanding and predicting soil microbial diversity patterns at depth. IMPORTANCE Exploring the biogeographic patterns of soil microbial diversity is critical for understanding mechanisms underlying the response of soil processes to climate change. Using top- and subsoils from an similar to 1,500-km temperate grassland transect, we find divergent patterns of microbial diversity and its determinants in the topsoil versus the subsoil. Furthermore, we find important and direct legacy effects of historical climate change on the microbial diversity of subsoil yet indirect effects on topsoil. Our findings challenge the conventional assumption of similar geographic patterns of soil microbial diversity along soil profiles and help to improve our understanding of how soil microbial communities may respond to future climate change in different regions with various climate histories.",2019,4,10.1128/mSystems.00566-19

Mangroves lie in special locations connecting coastal and estuarine areas and experience fluctuating conditions, which are expected to intensify with climate change, creating a need to better understand the relative roles of stochastic and deterministic processes in shaping microbial community assembly. Here, a study of microbial communities inhabiting mangrove sediments across southeastern China, spanning mangroves in six nature reserves, was conducted. We performed high-throughput DNA sequencing of these samples and compared them with data of 1,370 sediment samples collected from the Earth Microbiome Project (EMP) to compare the microbial diversity of mangroves with that of other biomes. Our results showed that prokaryotic alpha diversity in mangroves was significantly higher than that in other biomes and that microbial beta diversity generally clustered according to biome types. The core operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in mangroves were mostly assigned to Gammaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Euryarchaeota. The majority of beta nearesttaxon index values were higher than 2, indicating that community assembly in mangroves was better explained through a deterministic process than through a stochastic process. Mean annual precipitation (MAP) and total organic carbon (TOC) were main deterministic factors explaining variation in the microbial community. This study fills a gap in addressing the unique microbial diversity of mangrove ecosystems and their microbial community assembly mechanisms. IMPORTANCE Understanding the underlying mechanisms of microbial community assembly patterns is a vital issue in microbial ecology. Mangroves, as an important and special ecosystem, provide a unique environment for examining the relative importance of stochastic and deterministic processes.

We quantified the impact of spatial and environmental factors on bacterial community structure using variation partitioning analysis, illustrating a nonrandom distribution across the region. pH was confirmed as the key environmental driver structuring Arctic soil bacterial communities, while total organic carbon (TOC), moisture and conductivity were shown to have little effect. Specialist taxa were more abundant in acidic and alkaline soils while generalist taxa were more abundant in acidoneutral soils. Of the 48 147 bacterial taxa, a core microbiome composed of only 13 taxa that were ubiquitously distributed and present within 95% of samples was identified, illustrating the high potential for endemism in the region.

Fungi play major roles in ecosystem processes, but the determinants of fungal diversity and biogeographical patterns in saline agricultural systems remain poorly understood. Here we performed Illumina MiSeq high throughput sequencing of the fungal ITS1 region from 31 soils covering representative saline agricultural lands in northwest China. The results showed that Dothideomycetes, Eurotiomycetes and Sordariomycetes were the dominant taxonomic groups across all soil samples (>5% of all sequences), while saprotroph, pathotroph-saprotroph-symbiotroph and pathotroph were the main functional guilds across all soil samples. Interestingly, the fungal abundance and alpha diversity increased with increasing longitudinal gradient from 84 degrees 13 E to 89 degrees 11 E. Soil moisture, followed by salinity and total potassium, were the primary environmental drivers of the fungal community; these soil parameters were significantly (P < 0.05) correlated with longitude, and therefore potentially result in longitudinal fungal gradients. Furthermore, the fungal community assembly was mainly stochastic; fungal community exhibited distance-decay distribution patterns, which were mainly influenced by geographical distance. By contrast, environmental factors (such as salinity pH, soil moisture, or nutrients) mainly contributed to the variation in trophic guilds.

We tracked relationships between the soil microbiome and the human intestinal microbiome. We propose a novel environmental microbiome hypothesis, which implies that a close linkage between the soil microbiome and the human intestinal microbiome has evolved during evolution and is still developing. From hunter-gatherers to an urbanized society, the human gut has lost alpha diversity. Interestingly, beta diversity has increased, meaning that people in urban areas have more differentiated individual microbiomes. On top of little contact with soil and feces, hygienic measures, antibiotics and a low fiber diet of processed food have led to a loss of beneficial microbes. At the same time, loss of soil biodiversity is observed in many rural areas. The increasing use of agrochemicals, low plant biodiversity and rigorous soil management practices have a negative effect on the biodiversity of crop epiphytes and endophytes. These developments concur with an increase in lifestyle diseases related to the human intestinal microbiome. We point out the interference with the microbial cycle of urban human environments versus pre-industrial rural environments. In order to correct these interferences, it may be useful to adopt a different perspective and to consider the human intestinal microbiome as well as the soil/root microbiome as superorganisms which, by close contact, replenish each other with inoculants, genes and growth-sustaining molecules.",2019,7,10.3390/microorganisms7090287

HTS-based characterization of metabolically active (RNA-derived) and total (DNA-derived) fungal communities in different terrestrial habitats has revealed profound differences in both richness and community compositions. However, such DNA- and RNA-based HTS comparisons are widely missing for fungal communities of groundwater aquifers in the terrestrial biogeosphere. Therefore, in this study, we extracted DNA and RNA from groundwater samples of two pristine aquifers in the Hainich CZE and employed paired-end Illumina sequencing of the fungal nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) region to comprehensively test difference/similarities in the total and active fungal communities. We found no significant differences in the species richness between the DNA- and RNA-derived fungal communities, but the relative abundances of various fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) appeared to differ. We also found the same set of environmental parameters to shape the total and active fungal communities in the targeted aquifers. Furthermore, our comparison also underlined that about 30%-40% of the fungal OTUs were only detected in RNA-derived communities. This implies that the active fungal communities analyzed by HTS methods in the subsurface aquifers are actually not a subset of supposedly total fungal communities. In general, our study highlights the importance of differentiating the potential (DNA-derived) and expressed (RNA-derived) members of the fungal communities in aquatic ecosystems.",2019,7,10.3390/microorganisms7090341

However, few studies have attempted to interpret the microbial distance-decay pattern from the perspective of quantifying underlying processes. In this study, we examined the processes governing bacterial community assembly at multiple spatial scales in maize fields of Northeast China using Illumina MiSeq sequencing. Results showed that the processes governing spatial turnover in bacterial community composition shifted regularly with spatial scale, with homogenizing dispersal dominating at small spatial scales and variable selection dominating at larger scales, which in turn explained the distance-decay pattern that closer located sites tended to have higher community similarity. Together, homogenizing dispersal and dispersal limitation resulting from geographic factors governed about 33% of spatial turnover in bacterial community composition. Deterministic selection processes had the strongest influence, at 57%, with biotic factors and abiotic environmental filtering (mainly imposed by soil pH) respectively contributing about 37% and 63% of variation. Our results provided a novel and comprehensive way to explain the distance-decay pattern of soil microbiome via quantifying the assembly processes at multiple spatial scales, as well as the method to quantify the influence of abiotic, biotic, and geographic factors in shaping microbial community structure, thus enabling understanding of widely acknowledged microbial biogeographic patterns and microbial ecology.",2019,8,10.1002/mbo3.851

A Comprehensive Review,CUREUS,"Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is the autoimmune-mediated destruction of platelets. ITP is a diagnosis of exclusion after other identifiable etiologies have been ruled out. After the first report by Gasbarrini et al. (1998) showing rising platelet counts in ITP patients following Helicobacter pylori (HP) eradication therapy, there is growing evidence that highlights the role of HP in triggering ITP. However, the exact pathophysiology of HP-associated ITP is still unclear, but many theories have been implicated in this regard. According to various reports, the postulated mechanisms for the role of HP in cITP include molecular mimicry, increased plasmacytoid dendritic cell numbers, phagocytic perturbation, and variable host immune response to HP virulence factors. One famous theory suggested molecular mimicry between platelet surface antigen and bacterial virulence factor, i.e. cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA). It is thought that a chronic inflammatory response following an HP infection induces the host autoantibodies response against CagA, which cross-reacts with platelet surface glycoproteins; therefore, it may accelerate platelet destruction in the host reticuloendothelial system. However, further studies are mandated to better understand the causal link between ITP and HP and study the role of biogeography. Nowadays, it is recommended that every patient with ITP should undergo HP diagnostic testing and triple therapy should be administered in all those candidates who test positive for HP infection. In our review, there were a few pregnant female ITP patients who took HP eradication therapy mainly after 20 weeks of gestation without maternal or fetal worst outcomes. However, large-scale studies are advisable to study the adverse fetal outcomes following triple therapy use.",2019,11,10.7759/cureus.5551
"Ma, ZS",A new DTAR (diversity-time-area relationship) model demonstrated with the indoor microbiome,JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY,"Aim The spatio-temporal distribution of biodiversity is a core field of biogeography, and the so-termed species-time-area relationship (STAR), together with its siblings, that is the SAR (species-area relationship) and STR (species-time relationship), has achieved the rare status of classic laws in ecology and biogeography. Traditionally, the STAR or its recent generalization DTAR (diversity-time-area relationship) has been described with the bivariate power law (BPL) model or more recently with Whittaker, Triantis, and Ladle (2008, Journal of Biography; 35: 18) general dynamic model (GDM). We propose to extend the classic BPL into a more flexible DTAR model, which offers new quantitative methods for estimating maximal global diversity and charactering the relationship between local and regional diversity. Location Indoor microbiome. Taxon Microbes. Method We revise the BPL model by introducing two taper-off (cut-off) parameters or BPLEC (bivariate power law with exponential cutoffs) model, which eventually overwhelms the unsaturated increase of diversity over time and/or space and consequently can offer more realistic modelling of the joint spatio-temporal distribution of biodiversity. Based on the BPLEC model, we further define three new concepts for DTAR: maximal accrual diversity (MAD) profile, local-to-regional diversity (LRD) ratio profile and local-to-global diversity (LGD) ratio profile. Results We introduce and demonstrate the new BPLEC model with the indoor microbiome datasets (Lax et al., 2014, Science; 345: 1048-1052). The new model fitted to the microbiome datasets equally well or slightly better than existing BPL and GDM models, but it possesses two advantages stated below. Main conclusion First, the new BPLEC model overcomes the unlimited diversity accrual in temporal and/or spatial dimensions and hence offers more realistic modelling to the DTAR. Second, the MAD and LRD/LGD offer useful methods for estimating the dark or potential diversity, which accounts for the species locally absent but present in a habitat-specific regional species pool.",2019,46,10.1111/jbi.13636

Land-use intensification drives changes in microbial communities and the soil functions they regulate, but the mechanisms underlying these changes are poorly understood as land use can affect soil communities both directly (e.g. via changes in soil fertility) and indirectly (e.g. via changes in plant inputs). 2. The speed of microbial responses is also poorly understood. For instance, whether it is long-term legacies or short-term changes in land-use intensity that drive changes in microbial communities. 3. To address these topics, we measured multiple microbial functions, bacterial and fungal biomass and abiotic soil properties at two time intervals 3 years apart. This was performed in 150 grassland sites differing greatly in management intensity across three German regions. 4. Observed changes in microbial soil properties were related to both long-term means and short-term changes in: abiotic soil properties, land-use intensity, community abundance-weighted means of plant functional traits and plant biomass properties in regression and structural equation models. Plant traits, particularly leaf phosphorus, and soil pH were the best predictors of change in soil microbial function, as well as fungal and bacterial biomass, while land-use intensity showed weaker effects. 5. Indirect legacy effects, in which microbial change was explained by the effects of long-term land-use intensity on plant traits, were important, thus indicating a time lag between plant community and microbial change. Whenever the effects of short-term changes in land-use intensity were present, they acted directly on soil microorganisms. 6. Synthesis. The results provide new evidence that soil communities and their functioning respond to short-term changes in land-use intensity, but that both rapid and longer time-scale responses to changes in plant functional traits are at least of equal importance. This suggests that management which shapes plant communities may be an effective means of managing soil communities and the functions and services they provide.",2019,107,10.1111/1365-2745.13182

Moniliophthora spp. species are endemic from South America and infect Americas cocoa crops. Objetive. The objective of the study was to analyze the potential distribution and the fundamental niche of Moniliophthora roreri (Mr) and M. perniciosa (Mp) in America and Africa. Materials and methods. The occurrence records were obtained from a bibliographic review. Bioclimatic variables were used as predictors in the maximum entropy niche model (MaxEnt) and for its visualization in Niche Analyst 3.0. Results. The areas where Mr was most likely to occur were Esmeraldas and Los Rios, Ecuador, coastal zones of Costa Rica, Santander and Antioquia of Colombia, and for Mp the States of Bahia and Acre of Brazil. The variables that most influenced the distribution of Mr are those associated with precipitation. Temperature-related conditions were more important in the Mp model. The risk of Mr invasion was identified in the Acre and Para regions, Brazil. The transfer of the models evidenced the potential of Mr and Mp invasion in cocoa crops in Africa. The fundamental niche of pathogens and cocoa showed average similarity values, while the niche of fungal species showed a low similarity. Low pathogen niche similarity and differences in bioclimatic variables affecting pathogens distribution were related to a process of niche partitioning. Conclusion. Geographical regions with a greater potential distribution of pathogens and bioclimatic characteristics that would favor their probability of presence in Americas cocoa crops were identified.

However, the impact of soil on the assembly of bacterial communities after inoculation with suspensions from different soils is not clear. Here, we explored environmental filtering of bacterial community assembly. Diluted suspensions from different soils harboring different bacterial diversities were used to cross-inoculate three pre-sterilized soils. The main differences in the abiotic factors of the soils were organic matter, ammonium, nitrate, and phosphorus content, pH and the C:N ratio. We used 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to determine the bacterial community structure of the suspensions and the soils. When the different diluted suspensions were used to inoculate their native soils, the regrown soil bacterial communities clustered together; by contrast, the communities were separated when the same suspensions were used to inoculate soils other than their native soils. The diversity indices of the suspensions decreased significantly upon dilution. The strength of selection of bacterial communities by soil was stronger for the 10(-1) diluted soil samples than for the 10(-9) diluted soil samples.

One of the factors that provide information on the mechanisms regulating biodiversity is spatial scaling. We characterized the microbial communities using 16S rRNA gene sequences from DNA isolated from halite at various locations and correlated these to geographic distance in the Uyuni salt flat (Bolivia). Sequences from each site were analyzed to determine any spatial patterns of diversity, as well as to describe the microbial communities. Results suggest that different taxa are able to disperse over Uyunis surface crust regardless of distance.

Archaeal communities were homogeneous across the salt flat. In contrast, bacterial communities present strong local variations which could be attributed to external factors.

"Walsh, CM; Gebert, MJ; Delgado-Baquerizo, M; Maestre, FT; Fierer, N",A Global Survey of Mycobacterial Diversity in Soil,APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY,"Mycobacteria are a diverse bacterial group ubiquitous in many soil and aquatic environments. Members of this group have been associated with human and other animal diseases, including the nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), which are of growing relevance to public health worldwide. Although soils are often considered an important source of environmentally acquired NTM infections, the biodiversity and ecological preferences of soil mycobacteria remain largely unexplored across contrasting climates and ecosystem types. Using a culture-independent approach by combining 16S rRNA marker gene sequencing with mycobacterium-specific hsp65 gene sequencing, we analyzed the diversity, distributions, and environmental preferences of soil-dwelling mycobacteria in 143 soil samples collected from a broad range of ecosystem types. The surveyed soils harbored highly diverse mycobacterial communities that span the full extent of the known mycobacterial phylogeny, with most soil mycobacteria (97% of mycobacterial clades) belonging to previously undescribed lineages. While mycobacteria tended to have higher relative abundances in cool, wet, and acidic soil environments, several individual mycobacterial clades had contrasting environmental preferences. We identified the environmental preferences of many mycobacterial clades, including the clinically relevant Mycobacterium avium complex that was more commonly detected in wet and acidic soils. However, most of the soil mycobacteria detected were not closely related to known pathogens, calling into question previous assumptions about the general importance of soil as a source of NTM infections. Together, this work provides novel insights into the diversity, distributions, and ecological preferences of soil mycobacteria and lays the foundation for future efforts to link mycobacterial phenotypes to their distributions. IMPORTANCE Mycobacteria are common inhabitants of soil, and while most members of this bacterial group are innocuous, some mycobacteria can cause environmentally acquired infections of humans and other animals. Human infections from nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are increasingly prevalent worldwide, and some areas appear to be hotspots for NTM disease. While exposure to soil is frequently implicated as an important mode of NTM transmission, the diversity, distributions, and ecological preferences of soil mycobacteria remain poorly understood. We analyzed 143 soils from a range of ecosystems and found that mycobacteria and lineages within the group often exhibited predictable preferences for specific environmental conditions. Soils harbor large amounts of previously undescribed mycobacterial diversity, and lineages that include known pathogens were rarely detected in soil. Together, these findings suggest that soil is an unlikely source of many mycobacterial infections. The biogeographical patterns we documented lend insight into the ecology of this important group of soil-dwelling bacteria.",2019,85,10.1128/AEM.01180-19

Therefore, understanding the bacterial abundance, diversity, community composition, biogeography, and controlling environmental factors in such habitats is important. However, the information is still unexplored in Himalayan Rivers and their associated ecosystem towards the southern slopes, Nepal. Thus, composition and diversity of particle-attached (PA) and free-living (FL) bacteria was investigated along the mainstream and major tributaries of Koshi River i.e. the largest river of Nepal, using 16S rRNA gene-based Illumina MiSeq platform. Bacterial community composition significantly differed in habitat (mainstream and tributaries) and lifestyle (PA and FL), and the habitat variation was more pronounced than lifestyle variation. Likewise, bacterial communities were dissimilar in more geographically distant sites and vice versa. Distinct dominant taxa in mainstream and tributaries were indicative of different input sources and environmental conditions. Ten OTUs belonging to the phyla Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes contributed to more 50% of the bacterial community dissimilarity in two habitats. Geographical distance and water physicochemical properties explained for the most variation in PA and FL bacteria, respectively. Nonetheless, the individual effect of geographical distance was highest in both PA and FL bacteria. Effect of particulate environmental factor like TSS in variation of PA bacteria and that of dissolved environment factors like DOC and EC in FL bacteria was remarkable.",2019,104,10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.05.009

Also, to understand how microorganisms colonize and persist in non-sterile food fermentations across a specific table olive producing area, i.e. a specific agroecosystem. The microbial diversity, bacteria and yeast, in 30 ten-ton fermenters of three different fermentations yards (patios) along the olive fermentation was studied. A total of 951 microbial isolates were obtained which were clustered according to their RAPD profile. A total of 376 distinct genotypes were identified, belonging to 57 different microbial species, 41 bacterial and 16 yeast species. Up to 16 bacterial species had not been described before in table olives. Only the species Lactobacillus pentosus showed a ubiquitous presence in all 30 fermenters. Pediococcus parvulus, Lactobacillus collinoides/paracollinoides, Lactobacillus coryniformis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Pichia manshurica and Candida thaimueangensis were found in every patio. Cosmopolitan strains, up to 15, were shared by the three patios and belonged to the species L. pentosus (12 strains), P. parvulus (1), L. collinoides/paracollinoides (1) and P. manshurica (1). To expand our biodiversity analyses to the regional level, we have compared our results with those obtained from two previously studied patios of similar characteristics and in the same geographical area. PERMANOVA analysis of the microbial community composition revealed significant differences among different patios in their structure at every fermentation stage. In contrast, SIMPER analyses showed that, as fermentation progressed, the overall dissimilarities among patios were reduced. Discriminant species were identified for each fermentation stage. Among these, L. pentosus and P. parvulus were eu-constant species, while L. collinides/paracollinoides and Marinilactibacillus psychrotolerans group were constant species that could be considered microbial key taxa based on the occurrence stability index. The characteristic and, presumably, well adapted microbiota associated to the Spanish-style olive fermentations at the specific geographic area described here is a valuable natural resource which should be preserved conveniently. To our knowledge, this is the first study on the microbial biogeography of table olive fermentations, both at the species and strain levels.",2019,82,10.1016/j.fm.2019.02.004

Interrogating crustal life is difficult due to habitat inaccessibility, low-biomass and contamination challenges. Subseafloor observatories have facilitated the study of planktonic life in crustal aquifers, however, studies of life in crust-attached biofilms are rare. Here, we investigate biofilms grown on various minerals at different temperatures over 1-6 years at subseafloor observatories in the Eastern Pacific. To mitigate potential sequence contamination, we developed a new bioinformatics tool - TaxonSluice. We explore ecological factors driving community structure and potential function of biofilms by comparing our sequence data to previous amplicon and metagenomic surveys of this habitat. We reveal that biofilm community structure is driven by temperature rather than minerology, and that rare planktonic lineages colonize the crustal biofilms. Based on 16S rRNA gene overlap, we partition metagenome assembled genomes into planktonic and biofilm fractions and suggest that there are functional differences between these community types, emphasizing the need to separately examine each to accurately describe subseafloor microbe-rock-fluid processes.

A total of 32 phyla and 838 genera were detected from all the samples, in which Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Acidobacteria were the most dominant and cosmopolitan phyla. The most abundant phyla (relative abundance > 5%) detected in all 35 soil samples were also the most dominant, which could be explained by their great dispersal ability. The microbial community structures correlated strongly with variations in pH and Mg2 and were distinct between the high Mg2 content (>20 g/kg) samples and other samples (Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Chloroflexi were significantly less abundant in the high Mg2 content group, but the abundance of Firmicutes was significantly greater).

Despite the crucial ecological role of bacteria, our understanding of their large-scale biogeography patterns across longitude (east-west transect), and the processes that determine these patterns lags significantly behind that of macro-organisms. Here, we used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to evaluate the geographic distributions of bacterial diversity and their driving factors across different longitude sites along an 800-km east-west transect in the Loess Plateau. Twenty-four phyla were detected across all soil samples and the most sequence-abundant bacterial phyla were Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Chloroflexi and Gemmatimonadetes (average relative abundance >5%). Soil bacterial a-diversity, expressed by the richness of soil bacterial communities and Shannon diversity, differed among climates (MAP) but showed strong correlations with MAP (r = -0.537 and r = -0.42, respectively: p < 0.05 in both bacterial diversity indices). Variation partition analysis demonstrated that the bacterial community structure was closely correlated with environmental variables and geographic distance, which together explained 62% of the community variation. Soil properties contributed more to bacterial community variation than the combined geographic distance (historical contingencies) and climate factors. Among all environmental factors, soil pH exhibited a dominant role in structuring bacterial communities in this arid area. Our findings provide new evidence of bacterial biogeography patterns in an arid area (MAP ranged from 473 mm to 547 mm).

However, information on the role of viruses in such ecosystems and their interactions with prokaryotic hosts is very limited. Here, we investigated activities of benthic viruses and prokaryotes and their interactions in three hadal trenches (Japan, Izu-Ogasawara and Mariana trenches) and in their nearby abyssal sites. Our findings reveal that these hadal trenches, compared with the surrounding abyssal sites, support higher abundances and biomasses of prokaryotes. In addition, the high prokaryotic biomasses of hadal trenches could favor high rates of viral infection and cell lysis, especially in the Japan Trench. Hadal viruses can release large amounts of highly labile and promptly available organic material by inducing cell lysis, which could contribute to sustain benthic prokaryotes and decrease their dependency on the enzymatic digestion of the more refractory fraction of sediment organic matter. Our results suggest that this process can contribute to explain the discrepancy between high prokaryote biomass and apparent low efficiency in the utilization of the sedimentary organic matter in the hadal ecosystems. Concluding, hadal trenches may be characterized by a highly dynamic viral component, which can boost prokaryotic biomass production, thereby profoundly influencing the functioning of these remote and extreme ecosystems.",2019,10,10.3389/fmicb.2019.01952

Planktonic foraminifera and the existing stratigraphical framework of the Talara Basin indicate an early Oligocene, or possibly late Eocene, age of these deposits. They are found in three distinct areas - Belen, Cerro La Salina and Cerros El Pelado - and differ in their petrography, stable isotope signatures, and lipid biomarker and macrofaunal contents. At Belen, the carbon stable isotope signature of the carbonate and the abundance of n-alkanes indicates the possibility of oil seepage in addition to methane seepage; for Belen and Cerro La Salina the high abundance of the biomarker crocetane indicates a dominance of anaerobic methane-oxidizing archaea of the ANME-2 group, whereas the rather small combined crocetane/phytane peak of a Cerros El Pelado limestone agrees with mixed ANME-1/ANME-2 input. The macrofauna consists mainly of molluscs; the Cerro La Salina sites include mostly infaunal thyasirid and lucinid bivalves and only few vesicomyid bivalves; gastropods include Provanna antiqua, the limpet Pyropelta and several vetigastropods. The Belen site is dominated by the elongate vesicomyid bivalve Pleurophopsis lithophagoides. The most common bivalve at the Cerros El Pelado sites is an undetermined, possible vesicomyid, and a smooth provannid gastropod.

"Soininen, J; Teittinen, A",Fifteen important questions in the spatial ecology of diatoms,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"Recently, studies about the spatial distribution of microbial species and communities have increased substantially. Freshwater diatoms are used as one of the most popular model taxa in such macroecological studies, but the most exciting patterns in the spatial ecology of diatoms have not been reviewed. Here, we identify 15 important questions about freshwater diatom ecology, review the major findings, and suggest novel research avenues. We found that diatoms do not support classical latitudinal diversity gradient, species-area relationship or Rapoports rule. We found some, albeit inconsistent support for an elevational diversity gradient, Bergmanns rule and niche conservation. Diatoms do support a positive interspecific abundance-occupancy relationship like nearly all other taxa. With regards to metacommunity dynamics, diatom communities are typically structured by species sorting, but neutral dynamics or mass effects are also evident at large or small spatial scale, respectively. Taken together, this review suggests that diatoms follow some classical biogeographical patterns similarly to larger taxa, but patterns are typically weaker than for macro-organisms. This may result because diatoms are typically relatively strongly controlled by local factors and often exhibit efficient stochastic dispersal processes both at small and large scales. More research is needed to build a more comprehensive view of diatom species-area relationships and latitudinal gradients in diversity, for example. In the future, well-replicated macroecological field experiments, diatom studies with intercontinental or global coverage, trait-based approaches, and DNA-based species identification would be fruitful avenues to shed more light into the spatial ecology of diatoms.",2019,64,10.1111/fwb.13384

However, there is a lack of data at large spatial scales, on the biodiversity of soil microorganisms; national or more extensive studies to date have typically consisted of low replication of haphazardly collected samples. This has led to large spatial gaps in soil microbial biodiversity data. Using a pre-existing dataset of bacterial community composition across a 16-km regular sampling grid in France, we show that the number of detected OTUs changes little under different sampling designs (grid, random, or representative), but increases with the number of samples collected. All common OTUs present in the full dataset were detected when analyzing just 4% of the samples, yet the number of rare OTUs increased exponentially with sampling effort. We show that far more intensive sampling, across all global biomes, is required to detect the biodiversity of soil microorganisms. We propose avenues such as citizen science to ensure these large sample datasets can be more realistically achieved. Furthermore, we argue that taking advantage of pre-existing resources and programs, utilizing current technologies efficiently and considering the potential of future technologies will ensure better outcomes from large and extensive sample surveys.

One such element of concern is nitrogen, and in this study, we investigated the diversity and biogeography of potential diazotrophs within a series of thaw ponds representing different ontogenetic stages in pond development. Using metagenomic sequence data from subarctic thaw ponds, we identified an array of nitrogenase genes across the ponds. The iron-only nitrogenase gene (anfH) was positively correlated with sulfate, while there was no correlation with methane despite previous findings that organisms carrying anfH can simultaneously participate in nitrogen fixation and methanogenesis. Sulfate is known to inhibit microbial uptake of molybdate, an element essential for the activity of the nifH (molybdenum-iron) nitrogenase and this may explain the high potential for nitrogen fixation utilizing anfH in sulfate-rich ponds. NifH was particularly abundant in the hypolimnion of the deeper and older ponds, with Deltaproteobacteria and Chlorobi as the putative dominant diazotrophs. In the epilimnetic waters, nifH composition was more variable, with various Gammaproteobacteria as abundant representatives, while cyanobacterial diazotrophs were scarce. Interestingly, nifH gene abundance was significantly positively correlated with in situ methane concentration. Based on genome-resolved metagenomics, we hypothesize that diazotrophs and methanogens engage in syntrophic interactions in anoxic waters, possibly via propionate oxidation or (in Geobacter) by interspecies electron transfer. Our results also suggest that nitrogen fixers may supply bioreactive nitrogen compounds to the thaw pond communities, thereby enhancing growth and activity of methanogens.",2020,65,10.1002/lno.11243

An assessment of commonness/rarity for all 920 species indicates that nearly half of the parks lichens should be considered to be infrequent, rare, or exceptionally rare. We assessed the distributions of all 920 species and found that 54 are endemic to the southeastern United States, 30 are endemic to the southern Appalachians, and eight occur nowhere else than within the confines of the national park. We discuss biogeographical affinities of the parks lichen biota as a whole, delimiting six regional floristic connections. Our 11 years of research have resulted in the discovery of several species presumed to be extinct or near-extinct. We make one new combination (Fuscopannaria frullaniae) and describe five species as new to science, each commemorating National Park Service staff instrumental to the completion of the study: Heterodermia langdoniana, Lecanora darlingiae, Lecanora sachsiana, Leprocaulon nicholsiae, and Pertusaria superiana.",2019,44,10.1600/036364419X15710776741332

The diversity of alpine stream biota is largely reflective of environmental heterogeneity stemming from varying hydrological sources. Globally, alpine stream diversity is under threat as meltwater sources recede and stream conditions become increasingly homogeneous. Much attention has been devoted to macroinvertebrate diversity in alpine headwaters, yet to fully understand the breadth of climate change threats, a more thorough accounting of microbial diversity is needed. We characterized microbial diversity (specifically Bacteria and Archaea) of 13 streams in two disjunct Rocky Mountain subranges through 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Our study encompassed the spectrum of alpine stream sources (glaciers, snowfields, subterranean ice, and groundwater) and three microhabitats (ice, biofilms, and streamwater). We observed no difference in regional (.) diversity between subranges but substantial differences in diversity among (beta) stream types and microhabitats. Within-stream (a) diversity was highest in groundwater-fed springs, lowest in glacierfed streams, and positively correlated with water temperature for both streamwater and biofilm assemblages. We identified an underappreciated alpine stream type-the icy seep-that are fed by subterranean ice, exhibit cold temperatures (summer mean <2 degrees C), moderate bed stability, and relatively high conductivity. Icy seeps will likely be important for combatting biodiversity losses as they contain similar microbial assemblages to streams fed by surface ice yet may be buffered against climate change by insulating debris cover. Our results show that the patterns of microbial diversity support an ominous trend for alpine stream biodiversity; as meltwater sources decline, stream communities will become more diverse locally, but regional diversity will be lost. Icy seeps, however, represent a source of optimism for the future of biodiversity in these imperiled ecosystems.",2019,25,10.1111/gcb.14683
"Carrier, TJ; Dupont, S; Reitzel, AM",Geographic location and food availability offer differing levels of influence on the bacterial communities associated with larval sea urchins,FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY,"Determining the factors underlying the assembly, structure, and diversity of symbiont communities remains a focal point of animal-microbiome research. Much of these efforts focus on taxonomic variation of microbiota within or between animal populations, but rarely test the proportional impacts of ecological components that may affect animal-associated microbiota. Using larvae from the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis from the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, we test the hypothesis that, under natural conditions, inter-population differences in the composition of larval-associated bacterial communities are larger than intra-population variation due to a heterogeneous feeding environment. Despite significant differences in bacterial community structure within each S. droebachiensis larval population based on food availability, development, phenotype, and time, variation in OTU membership and community composition correlated more strongly with geographic location. Moreover, 20-30% of OTUs associated with larvae were specific to a single location while less than 10% were shared. Taken together, these results suggest that inter-populational variation in symbiont communities may be more pronounced than intra-populational variation, and that this difference may suggest that broad-scale ecological variables (e.g., across ocean basins) may mask smaller scale ecological variables (e.g., food availability).",2019,95,10.1093/femsec/fiz103

Its successful adaptation to other locations, such as the Atlantic Forest in the Southeast region, may be related to its ability to establish symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, especially beta-rhizobia of the genus Paraburkholderia. The objective of this work was to determine whether M. caesalpiniifolia adapted to bacterial symbionts in locals where it was introduced. Bacteria were recovered from nodules of M. caesalpiniifolia and characterized at the genetic level by BOX-PCR and sequencing of the 16S rRNA, recA, nifH, and nodC genes. Their symbiotic effectiveness was assessed under axenic conditions. M. caesalpiniifolia nodulated mainly with Paraburkholderia sabiae and a few strains of Rhizobium in the Southeast. On the other hand, the symbionts found in the Northeast were, predominantly, Paraburkholderia diazotrophica. Regardless of its origin, P. diazotrophica promoted a superior accumulation of plant biomass than other bacterial species. The results presented here demonstrate the ability of M. caesalpiniifolia to adapt to bacterial populations outside its location of origin, and indicate that, in this case, the symbiotic effectiveness was associated with the taxonomical classification of the strains.",2019,95,10.1093/femsec/fiz109

The Mediterranean Sea is an oligotrophic to ultra-oligotrophic marginal sea, which neighbors northern Africa (a major source of natural aerosols) and Europe (a source of mostly anthropogenic aerosols). Previous studies demonstrated that airborne bacteria deposited during dust events over the Mediterranean Sea may significantly alter the ecology and function of the surface seawater layer, yet little is known about their abundance and diversity during background non-storm conditions. Here, we describe the abundance and genetic diversity of airborne bacteria in 16 air samples collected over an East-West transect of the entire Mediterranean Sea during non-storm conditions in April 2011. The results show that airborne bacteria represent diverse groups with the most abundant bacteria from the Firmicutes (Bacilli and Clostridia) and Proteobacteria (Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, and Gammaproteobacteria) phyla. Most of the bacteria in our samples have previously been observed in the air at other open ocean locations, in the air over the Mediterranean Sea during dust storms, and in the Mediterranean seawater. Airborne bacterial abundance ranged from 0.7 x 10(4) to 2.5 x 10(4) cells m(-3) air, similar to abundances at other oceanic regimes. Our results demonstrate that airborne bacterial diversity is positively correlated with the mineral dust content in the aerosols and was spatially separated between major basins of the Mediterranean Sea. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive biogeographical dataset to assess the diversity and abundance of airborne microbes over the Mediterranean Sea. Our results shed light on the spatiotemporal distribution of airborne microbes and may have implications for dispersal and distribution of microbes (biogeography) in the ocean.",2019,10,10.3390/atmos10080440

To investigate the importance of temperature, at broad geographical and taxonomic scales, we extended a global database of terrestrial arthropods screened for Wolbachia and Cardinium. Our final dataset contained data from more than 117 000 arthropods (over 2500 species) screened for Wolbachia and more than 18 000 arthropods (over 800 species) screened for Cardinium, including samples from 137 different countries, with mean temperatures varying from -6.5 to 29.2 degrees C. In insects and relatives, Cardinium infection showed a clear and consistent tendency to increase with temperature. For Wolbachia, a tendency to increase with temperature in temperate climates is counteracted by reduced prevalence in the tropics, resulting in a weak negative trend overall.

Intact microbiome samples are immobilized in a gel matrix and cryofractured into particles. Neighboring microbial taxa in the particles are then identified by droplet-based encapsulation, barcoded 16S rRNA amplification and deep sequencing. Analysis of three regions of the mouse intestine revealed heterogeneous microbial distributions with positive and negative co-associations between specific taxa.

To what extent the concept can be generalized, particularly to free-drifting organisms, is currently debated. Here we use approximately 16,000 phytoplankton samples from two large coastal ecosystems-the Baltic Sea and Chesapeake Bay-to analyze the relationship between salinity and phytoplankton species richness. Alpha diversity showed a consistent variation along the salinity gradient, with a minimum at mesohaline salinities of around 7-9. Rarefied species pools at narrow salinity intervals also showed reduced diversity at intermediate salinities, surrounded by high richness toward both ends of the gradient. The cumulative likelihood of species presence validated the minimum at intermediate salinities. Community composition changed abruptly at the alpha diversity minimum in the Baltic Sea, while it changed gradually along the salinity gradient in Chesapeake Bay.

This study focussed on the previously uncharacterised inland nunataks of the Jutulsessen and Ahlmannryggen ranges in Dronning Maud Land. As with many oligotrophic soils in Antarctica, bacteria from the phyla Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria were prevalent. High relative abundances of Bacteroidetes and Chloroflexi were also observed in these soils. Potential phototrophic capabilities of these bacterial populations were indicated by the presence of genes involved in the Calvin-Benson reductive pentose phosphate cycle as well as that of aerobic phototrophic bacteriochlorophyll. Clear spatial patterns of bacterial biodiversity between nunataks in this study were observed, particularly between the Jutulsessen and Ahlmannryggen nunataks which are geographically separated by the Jutulstraumen glacier. Not unexpectedly, the bacterial community profiles found in these nunataks were distinct from those found in alternate biogeographic regions (e.g. Dry Valleys, Peninsula and Larsemann Hills). Despite belonging to the same bioregion (i.e. Dronning Maud Land), however, the clear differentiation of bacterial communities between the Jutulsessen/Ahlmannryggen and that of Sor Rondane suggests that, based on bacterial phylogeography, the Dronning Maud Land bioregion can be divided into sub-bioregions.",2019,42,10.1007/s00300-019-02532-1

Although half of the soil C and N is stored in deep soils (below 30 cm), no regional-scale study of microbial properties and their functions through the soil profile has been conducted in these drylands. To explore the distribution and determinants of microbial properties and C and N mineralization rates through soil profile along aridity gradient at a regional scale, we investigated these variables for four soil layers (0-20, 20-40, 40-60 and 60-100 cm) in 132 plots on the Mongolia Plateau. Soil microbial properties (biomass and bacteria:fungi ratio) and C and N mineralization rates decreased with increasing soil depth and aridity at the regional scale. Aridity-induced declines in soil microbial properties mainly resulted from the negative effects of aridity on ANPP/root biomass and soil organic C (SOC) in the surface soil layers (0-20 and 20-40 cm) but from the direct and indirect (via SOC and soil C/N) negative effects of aridity in the deep soil layers (40-60 and 60-100 cm). Aridity-induced declines in soil C mineralization rates mainly resulted from the negative indirect effect of aridity on SOC and microbial properties in each soil layer, with weaker effects of SOC and stronger effects of soil microbes in the deep soil layers. Aridity-induced declines in soil N mineralization rates mainly resulted from the negative indirect effect of aridity on SOC in the three soil layers above 60 cm and mainly resulted from the negative direct effect of aridity in the 60-100 cm soil layer. Aridity via direct or indirect effects strongly determined the patterns of soil microbial properties and C and N mineralization throughout soil profiles on the Mongolian Plateau. These findings suggest that the increases in aridity are likely to induce changes in soil micro-organisms and their associated functions across soil depths of semi-arid grasslands, and future models should consider the dynamic interactions between substrates and microbial properties across soil depths in global drylands.

We developed and applied high-throughput sequencing for the 16S-23S rRNA internally transcribed spacer (ITS) to examine ecotype and fine-scale genotypic community dynamics for monthly surface water samples spanning 5 years at the San Pedro Ocean Time-series site. Ecotype-level structure displayed regular seasonal patterns including succession, consistent with strong forcing by seasonally varying abiotic parameters (e.g. temperature, nutrients, light). We identified tens to thousands of amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) within ecotypes, many of which exhibited distinct patterns over time, suggesting ecologically distinct populations within ecotypes. Community structure within some ecotypes exhibited regular, seasonal patterns, but not for others, indicating other more irregular processes such as phage interactions are important. Network analysis including T4-like phage genotypic data revealed distinct viral variants correlated with different groups of cyanobacterial ASVs including time-lagged predator-prey relationships. Variation partitioning analysis indicated that phage community structure more strongly explains cyanobacterial community structure at the ASV level than the abiotic environmental factors. These results support a hierarchical model whereby abiotic environmental factors more strongly shape niche partitioning at the broader ecotype level while phage interactions are more important in shaping community structure of fine-scale variants within ecotypes.",2019,21,10.1111/1462-2920.14687
"Herren, CM",Asexual Reproduction Can Account for the High Diversity and Prevalence of Rare Taxa Observed in Microbial Communities,APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY,"Recent studies evaluating the community structures of microorganisms and macroorganisms have found greater diversity and rarity within micro-scale communities, compared to macro-scale communities. However, reproductive method has been a confounding factor in these comparisons; the microbes considered generally reproduce asexually, while the macroorganisms considered generally reproduce sexually. Sexual reproduction imposes the constraint of mate finding, which can have significant demographic consequences by depressing birth rates at low population sizes. First, I construct an island biogeography model to study the organization of ecological communities under neutral stochastic processes. Then, I examine theoretically how the effects of mate finding in sexual populations translate to the emergent community properties of diversity, rarity, and dominance (size of the largest population). In mate-limited sexual populations, the decreased growth rates at low population densities translate to a higher extinction rate; this increased extinction rate had a disproportionately strong effect on taxa with low population densities. Thus, mate limitation decreased diversity, primarily by excluding small populations from communities. However, the most abundant taxa were minimally affected by mate limitation. Therefore, mate limitation affected the diversity and rarity of taxa in communities but did not alter the dominance of the largest population. The observed shifts in community structure mirror recent empirical studies of micro-scale versus macro-scale communities, which have shown that microbial communities have greater diversity and rarity than macrobial communities but are not different in dominance. Thus, reproductive method may contribute to observed differences in emergent properties between communities at these two scales. IMPORTANCE There have been numerous recent efforts to integrate microbes into broad-scale ecological theories. Microbial communities are often structurally distinct from macrobial communities, but it is unclear whether these differences are real or whether they are due to the different methodologies used to study communities at these two scales. One major difference between macroorganisms and microorganisms is that microbes are much more likely to reproduce asexually. Sexually reproducing taxa have diminished growth rates at low population size, because they must encounter another member of their species before reproducing. This study shows that communities of asexually reproducing taxa are expected to be more diverse, because taxa persist longer. Furthermore, asexually reproducing taxa can exist at much lower densities than sexually reproducing taxa. Thus, asexual reproduction by microbes can account for two major differences between microbial and macrobial communities, namely, greater diversity and greater prevalence of rare taxa for microbes.",2019,85,10.1128/AEM.01099-19

Here, we explore whether spatial scale-dependent patterns of beta-diversity vary between microbial functional groups and bacterial taxa (i.e., diazotrophic and bacterial communities) across local to regional scales (from metres to hundreds of kilometres). Location Eastern China. Time period October and November 2015. Major taxa studied Diazotrophic and bacterial communities. We use two complementary statistical tools to unveil biotic mechanisms (i.e., species association) underlying variation in beta-diversity of diazotrophic and bacterial communities. We examined distance-decay slopes of both communities at the local (1-113 m), meso- (3.4-39 km) and regional (103-668 km) scales. We used an environmentally constrained checkerboard score and topological features of association networks as indices of species association. We then calculated contributions of species association, abiotic factors and geographical distance to explain community beta-diversity. The scale-dependent distance-decay relationships were also examined in ubiquitous (high occupancy across samples) and endemic communities of diazotrophs and bacteria. Diazotrophs displayed steeper distance-decay slopes than bacteria, suggesting that the beta-diversity of diazotrophic communities was more variable. The distance-decay slopes were dependent on spatial scales in both communities, owing to different contributions of geographical distance, abiotic factors and species association at three spatial scales. Intriguingly, species association was greater and contributed more to community beta-diversity than other forces at the local scale, implying that species association could greatly alter community structures. Drivers of diazotrophic and bacterial community beta-diversity depended on spatial scales, resulting in different distance-decay patterns. Moreover, this was the first study to use two methods to demonstrate that species association played important, but as yet unrecognized, roles in driving spatial scale-dependent beta-diversity.

We collected soil samples from different micro-topographic positions and elevational levels in two mountain regions of the Scandes, Central Norway. Microbial community composition was characterized by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and was dependent on microtopography and elevation. Underlying environmental drivers were identified by integration of microbial community data with a comprehensive set of site-specific long-term recorded temperature and soil moisture data. Partial least square regression analysis allowed the description of ecological response patterns and the identification of the important environmental drivers for each taxonomic group. This demonstrated for the first time that taxa responding to elevation were indeed most strongly defined by temperature, rather than by other environmental factors. Micro-topography affected taxa were primarily controlled by temperature and soil moisture. In general, 5-year datasets had higher explanatory power than 1-year datasets, indicating that the microbial community composition is dependent on long-term developments of near-ground temperature and soil moisture regimes and possesses a certain resilience, which is in agreement with an often observed delayed response in global warming studies in arctic-alpine regions.",2019,13,10.1038/s41396-019-0409-9

Here, we use continental- and global-scale soil fungal community surveys, focused within northern temperate latitudes, to estimate the relative contribution of time and space to soil fungal community turnover. We detected large intra-annual temporal differences in soil fungal community similarity, where fungal communities differed most among seasons, equivalent to the community turnover observed over thousands of kilometers in space. inter-annual community turnover was comparatively smaller than intra-annual turnover. Certain environmental covariates, particularly climate covariates, explained some spatial-temporal effects, though it is unlikely the same mechanisms drive spatial vs. temporal turnover. However, these commonly measured environmental covariates could not fully explain relationships between space, time and community composition.

Publishing of Red Lists of animals or higher plants is quite common, but practical protection of algae and especially microalgae is quite a complex task with several difficulties. These complications are the result of our quite poor knowledge about biodiversity (taxonomy, phylogeny) of microalgae together with insufficient data about worldwide distribution of microalgae taxa (undersampling). The need to protect microorganisms, microalgae and heterotrophic protists is a crucial matter due to their role in bioindication and evaluation of the quality of their habitats. That is why it is necessary to have a Red List of these phototrophic organisms as a practical manual for the protection of their habitat and, subsequently, also to have it as a basis for the protection of these organisms. Generally, microorganisms must be viewed not as rare species (in terms of their poor knowledge about distribution, ecology and taxonomy), but as little-known species and a Red List would reflect this idea. We propose a Red List of microalgae, using euglenophytes as a model group, with reflection of taxonomy and autecology of listed species with links to endangered habitats: habitat protection must be understood as a synonym for species conservation.

This symbiosis ICE takes 2 forms in the bacterial chromosome-tripartite and monopartite-with tripartite ICEs confined to a broadly distributed superspecies Glade. The pairwise evolutionary relatedness of these elements is controlled as much by geographic distance as by the evolutionary relatedness of the background genome. In contrast, diversity in the broader gene content of Mesorhizobium genomes follows a tight linear relationship with core genome phylogenetic distance, with little detectable effect of geography. These results illustrate how geography and demography can operate differentially on the evolution of bacterial genomes and offer useful insights for the development of improved technologies for sustainable agriculture.",2019,116,10.1073/pnas.1900056116

Here, we used a high-resolution spatial and temporal analysis of Prochlorococcus sp. in the Eastern Indian Ocean to determine whether ecotypes and microdiverse taxa can be used to identify fine-scale biogeochemical regimes in this under-studied region. A total of 246 DNA samples were collected every 4-6 h in April 2016 on GO-SHIP cruise I09N, which transected gyre, equatorial, and monsoonal ecosystems between Western Australia and the Bay of Bengal. Using amplicon sequencing of the highly variable rpoC1 marker, we found that the region was largely dominated by the Prochlorococcus HL-II clade. Conserved single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were used to identify four microdiverse haplotypes, or SNP-delineated taxa, within the HL-II clade of Prochlorococcus. The haplotypes showed regional patterns of relative gene count abundance that were significantly correlated with environmental conditions. Additionally, we used nonlinear least squares models to fit the sine wave function to our data and demonstrate that the haplotypes show distinct patterns in relative diel frequency, providing evidence that these microdiverse populations are ecologically and evolutionarily distinct. Overall, we show how the integration of a genomics data set into a biogeochemical framework can reveal a more nuanced understanding of a complex ocean basin.",2020,65,10.1002/lno.11251

Thus, the AGS system provides a unique ecosystem to study the importance of local (species sorting) and regional (immigration) processes in bacterial community assembly. The microbial communities of different-sized aggregates (flocs <0.2 mm, small granules (0.2-1.0 mm) and large granules >1.0 mm), influent wastewater, excess sludge and effluent of a full-scale AGS plant were characterized over a steady-state operation period of 6 months. Amplicon sequencing was integrated with mass balance to determine the SRT and net growth rate of operational taxonomic units (OTUs). We found strong evidence of species sorting as opposed to immigration, which was significantly higher at short SRT (i.e., flocs and small granules) than that at long SRT (large granules). Rare OTUs in wastewater belonging to putative functional groups responsible for nitrogen and phosphorus removal were progressively enriched with an increase in microbial aggregates size. In contrast, fecal- and sewage infrastructure-derived microbes progressively decreased in relative abundance with increase in microbial aggregate size. These findings highlight the importance of AGS as a unique model ecosystem to study fundamental microbial ecology concepts.",2019,53,10.1021/acs.est.8b07303

The influence of bacteria and fungi on wine fermentation is well known. However, little is known about the role of soil microbes, other than microbial pathogens, on grape composition or their role in vintage or site (terroir) impacts on grape composition. In this study, we used an amplicon sequencing approach to investigate the potential relationships between soil microbes and inherent spatial variation in grape metabolite composition - specifically, the concentration of the impact aroma compound rotundone in Shiraz grapes (Vitis vinifera L.) grown in a 6.1 ha vineyard in the Grampians region of Victoria, Australia. Previous work had demonstrated temporal stability in patterns of within-vineyard spatial variation in rotundone concentration, enabling identification of defined zones of inherently low or high concentration of this grape metabolite. 16S rRNA and ITS region-amplicon sequencing analysis of microbial communities in the surface soils collected from these zones indicated marked differences between zones in the genetic diversity and composition of the soil bacterial and fungal microbiome. Soils in the High rotundone zone exhibited higher diversity of bacteria, but lower diversity of fungi, compared to the soils in the Low rotundone zone. In addition, the network analysis of the microbial community in the High rotundone zone soils appeared well structured, especially with respect to the bacterial community, compared to that in the Low rotundone zone soils. The key differences in the microbial community structure between the rotundone zones are obvious for taxa/groups of both bacteria and fungi, particularly for bacteria belonging to Acidobacteria-GP4 and GP7, Rhizobiales, Gaiellaceae, Alphaproteobacteria and the Nectriaceae and Tremellaceae families of fungi. Although mulching in some parts of the vineyard caused changes in bacterial and fungal composition and overall microbial catabolic diversity and activity, its effects did not mask the rotundone zone-based variation. This finding of a systematic rotundone zone-based variation in soil microbiomes suggests an opportunity to bring together understanding of microbial ecology, plant biochemistry, and viticultural management for improved management of grape metabolism, composition and wine flavor.",2019,10,10.3389/fmicb.2019.01607

Regrettably, equatorial glaciers and snow are disappearing rapidly, and we are likely the last generation who will get to know these peculiar places. Despite the permanently harsh conditions of glacier/snow habitats, they support a remarkable diversity of life ranging from bacteria to animals. Numerous papers have been devoted to microbial communities and unique animals on polar glaciers and high mountains, but only two reports relate to glacial biodiversity in equatorial regions, which are destined to melt completely within the next few decades. Equatorial glaciers constitute cold islands in tropics, and discovering their diversity might shed light on the biogeography, dispersal, and history of psychrophiles. Thus, an opportunity to protect biota of equatorial glaciers hinges on ex situ conservation.

Here, we investigated the water-depth distribution of surface sediment bacterial phyla and their driving factors in Lake Lugu, a plateau lake in Southwest China. Our results revealed that the relative abundance of 11 dominant bacterial phyla showed various water-depth patterns, such as increasing, decreasing, hump-shaped, and U-shaped patterns. These patterns across phyla were consistent with their different niche positions of water depth, while the occupancy-abundance relationships were not dependent on phylum attributes. Consistently, phylum abundance was best explained by water depth; other physical and chemical factors, such as metal ion concentrations, SiO2, and pH, can also explain the variations in some bacterial phyla. Chemical variables were the main drivers of the dominant bacterial phyla. However, biotic variables also showed substantial importance for some phyla, such as Planctomycetes, Actinobacteria, and WS3.

The next decade is poised to focus on microbial traits and function. Most existing methods for doing this perform pathway analysis using reference databases. This has both benefits and drawbacks. Function can go undetected if reference databases are coarse-grained or incomplete. Likewise, detection of a pathway does not guarantee expression of the associated function. Finally, function cannot be connected to specific microbial constituents, making it difficult to ascertain the types of organisms exhibiting particular traits-something that is important for understanding microbial success in specific environments. A complementary approach to pathway analysis is to use the wealth of microbial trait information collected over years of lab-based, culture experiments.MethodsHere, we use journal articles and Bergeys Manual of Systematic Bacteriology to develop a trait-based database for 971 human skin bacterial taxa. We then use this database to examine functional traits that are over/underrepresented among skin taxa. Specifically, we focus on three trait classes-binary, categorical, and quantitative-and compare trait values among skin taxa and microbial taxa more broadly. We compare binary traits using a Chi-square test, categorical traits using randomization trials, and quantitative traits using a nonparametric relative effects test based on global rankings using Tukey contrasts.ResultsWe find a number of traits that are over/underrepresented within the human skin microbiome. For example, spore formation, acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase, pigment production, catalase, and oxidase are all less common among skin taxa. As well, skin bacteria are less likely to be aerobic, favoring, instead, a facultative strategy. They are also less likely to exhibit gliding motility, less likely to be spirillum or rod-shaped, and less likely to grow in chains. Finally, skin bacteria have more difficulty at high pH, prefer warmer temperatures, and are much less resilient to hypotonic conditions.ConclusionsOur analysis shows how an approach that relies on information from culture experiments can both support findings from pathway analysis, and also generate new insights into the structuring principles of microbial communities.",2019,7,10.1186/s40168-019-0698-2

However, morphological identification of these microorganisms is often possible only to higher taxonomic ranks such as genus, because of low morphological diversity and high variability along with the presence of cryptic taxa. This study compared the species composition of cyanobacteria, and green and streptophyte microalgae, isolated from biological soil crusts (BSCs) of maritime sand dunes (Baltic Sea, Germany) and identified through culture-dependent morphological methods combined with molecular phylogenetic data. Phylogenetic analyses (based on SSU rRNA and ITS-1,2 for microalgae, or the SSU-LSU ITS region for cyanobacteria) provided unambiguous identifications of 20 strains (37.7% of all strains investigated) to species level; the identifications had to be corrected after preliminary morphological determination of eight strains. For 27 strains (50.9%), identification with molecular markers was possible only to genus or group of closely related species, because a modern taxonomic revision of these taxa is preliminary, incomplete or non-existent. Identification to genus was problematic for six strains (11.3%). This combination of morphological and molecular methods (integrative approach) resulted in the discovery of rare, taxonomically or ecologically interesting taxa, and in the description of a new species of Tetradesmus (T. arenicola sp. nov.), a new combination for Chlamydomonas callunae (Heterochlamydomonas callunae comb. nov.), epitypification of the rare alga Actinochloris sphaerica and emendation of the recently described Eremochloris sphaerica. A microscopic culture-dependent method and an integrative approach provided similar results concerning the cyanobacterial and algal diversity of BSCs of Baltic sand dunes in general. However, this investigation using an integrative approach allowed us to precisely identify species of several important taxa (the most common and dominant species) in the community structure of BSCs, and also certain rare representatives.",2019,54,10.1080/09670262.2018.1557257

However, our knowledge of their diversity and regional biogeographic patterns in high-altitude alpine lakes is limited. In this study, to investigate the diversity and geographic patterns of the FL and PA bacterial communities and to quantify the relative influence of environmental filtering and dispersal limitation in shaping the FL and PA bacterial communities, we collected surface water samples from 26 lakes over 1000 kilometers on the Tibetan Plateau. The majority of sequences exclusively in the FL bacteria were Actinobacteria (29.4%), Proteobacteria (27.7%) and Bacteroidetes (21.6%), while sequences exclusively in the PA bacteria were dominated by Proteobacteria (57.9%). The alpha-diversity indices, including Shannon index and Pielous evenness, were significantly lower in the FL bacteria than that in PA bacteria. The surrounding soils as an important potential source contributed more to the diversity of the PA bacteria than the FL bacteria. Both of the FL and PA bacterial communities exhibited a significant regional distance-decay pattern. Environmental filtering and dispersal limitation were significantly related to the spatial variation of the FL and PA bacterial communities, whereas the environmental filtering/dispersal limitation effect ratio was higher in the FL bacterial communities.

"Bartelme, RP; Smith, MC; Sepulveda-Villet, OJ; Newton, RJ",Component Microenvironments and System Biogeography Structure Microorganism Distributions in Recirculating Aquaculture and Aquaponic Systems,MSPHERE,"Flowthrough and pond aquaculture system microbiome management practices aim to mitigate fish disease and stress. However, the operational success of recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) depends directly on system microbial community activities. In RAS, each component environment is engineered for a specific microbial niche for waste management, as the water continuously flowing through the system must be processed before returning to the rearing tank. In this study, we compared waste management component microbiomes (rearing tank water, pH correction tank, solid-waste clarifier, biofilter, and degassing tower) within a commercial-scale freshwater RAS by high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing. To assess consistency among freshwater RAS microbiomes, we also compared the microbial community compositions of six aquaculture and aquaponic farms. Community assemblages reflected site and source water relationships, and the presence of a hydroponic subsystem was a major community determinant. In contrast to the facility-specific community composition, some sequence variants, mainly classified into Flavobacterium, Cetobacterium, the family Sphingomonadaceae, and nitrifying guilds of ammonia-oxidizing archaea and Nitrospira, were common across all facilities. The findings of this study suggest that, independently of system design, core taxa exist across RAS rearing similar fish species but that system design informs the individual aquatic microbiome assemblages. Future RAS design would benefit from understanding the roles of these core taxa and then capitalizing on their activities to further reduce system waste/added operational controls. IMPORTANCE Recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) are agroecosystems for intensive on-land cultivation of products of fisheries. Practitioners that incorporate edible plant production into RAS refer to these facilities as aquaponic systems (AP). RAS have the potential to offset declining production levels of wild global fisheries while reducing waste and product distance to market, but system optimization is needed to reduce costs. Both RAS and AP rely on microbial consortia for maintaining water quality and promoting fish/plant health, but little is known about the microorganisms actually present. This lack of knowledge prevents optimization of designs and operational controls to target the growth of beneficial microbial species or consortia. The significance of our research is in identifying the common microorganisms that inhabit production RAS and AP and the operational factors that influence which microorganisms colonize and become abundant. Identifying these organisms is a first step toward advanced control of microbial activities that improve reproducibility and reduce costs.",2019,4,10.1128/mSphere.00143-19

To explore the contributions of these factors to skin microbiome variation, we profiled the bacterial microbiomes of 495 North American subjects (ages, 9 to 78 years) at four skin surfaces plus the oral epithelium using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. We collected subject metadata, including host physiological parameters, through standardized questionnaires and noninvasive biophysical methods. Using a combination of statistical modeling tools, we found that demographic, lifestyle, and physiological factors collectively explained 12 to 20% of the variability in microbiome composition. The influence of health factors was strongest on the oral microbiome. Associations between host factors and the skin microbiome were generally dominated by operational taxonomic units (OTUs) affiliated with the Clostridiales and Prevotella. A subset of the correlations between microbial features and host attributes were site specific. To further explore the relationship between age and the skin microbiome of the forehead, we trained a Random Forest regression model to predict chronological age from microbial features. Age was associated mostly with two mutually coexcluding Corynebacterium OTUs. Furthermore, skin aging variables (wrinkles and hyperpigmented spots) were independently correlated to these taxa. IMPORTANCE Many studies have highlighted the importance of body site and individuality in shaping the composition of the human skin microbiome, but we still have a poor understanding of how extrinsic (e.g., lifestyle) and intrinsic (e.g., age) factors influence its composition. We characterized the bacterial microbiomes of North American volunteers at four skin sites and the mouth. We also collected extensive subject metadata and measured several host physiological parameters. Integration of host and microbial features showed that the skin microbiome was predominantly associated with demographic, lifestyle, and physiological factors. Furthermore, we uncovered reproducible associations between chronological age, skin aging, and members of the genus Corynebacterium. Our work provides new understanding of the role of host selection and lifestyle in shaping skin microbiome composition. It also contributes to a more comprehensive appreciation of the factors that drive interindividual skin microbiome variation.",2019,10,10.1128/mBio.00839-19

In continuous cropping, however, the concentrations of root exudates of which daidzein is one of the major secretions might influence nodulating rhizobium communities and cause ineffective nitrogen fixation in soybean. The dynamics of indigenous rhizobia that form nodules with the soybean cultivars Tamahomare, Enrei and Tamabaguro at three cycles of a continuous cropping plot under different experimental conditions were examined. PCR-RFLP analysis targeted to the 16S-23S rRNA gene internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of a bacterium, confirmed by sequencing analysis, was used to determine the bacterial type for each root nodule. The results showed that as the number of cycles increased, the proportion of B. diazoefficiens USDA110 of all cultivars decreased. Under all experimental conditions, the average differences between the proportion of B. diazoefficiens USDA110 of the first and third cycles in Tamahomare, Enrei and Tamabaguro were 67%, 70% and 44%, respectively. After the HPLC analysis of the root-secreted isoflavonoids, the results showed that the root-secreted daidzein from Tambaguro was excreted in the highest levels among the three cultivars. Increase of the proportion of B. diazoefficiens USDA110 among seedlings treated with daidzein was also noted. Therefore, the present study reports that the symbiotic relationship of soybean with B. diazoefficiens USDA110 decreases in continuous cropping and suggests that root-secreted daidzein helps to maintain populations of this rhizobial strain in rhizosphere of some cultivars.",2019,93,10.1016/j.ejsobi.2019.103098

Although measurements of pelagic marine N-2 fixation are predominantly from oligotrophic oceanic regions, where N limitation is thought to favor growth of diazotrophic microbes, here we report high rates of N-2 fixation from seven cruises spanning four seasons in temperate, western North Atlantic coastal waters along the North American continental shelf between Cape Hatteras and Nova Scotia, an area representing 6.4% of the North Atlantic continental shelf area. Integrating average areal rates of N-2 fixation during each season and for each domain in the study area, the estimated N input from N-2 fixation to this temperate shelf system is 0.02 Tmol N/year, an amount equivalent to that previously estimated for the entire North Atlantic continental shelf. Unicellular group A cyanobacteria (UCYN-A) were most often the dominant diazotrophic group expressing nifH, a gene encoding the nitrogenase enzyme, throughout the study area during all seasons. This expands the domain of these diazotrophs to include coastal waters where dissolved N concentrations are not always depleted. Further, the high rates of N-2 fixation and diazotroph diversity along the western North Atlantic continental shelf underscore the need to reexamine the biogeography and the activity of diazotrophs along continental margins.

Our analyses revealed that the global activated sludge bacterial communities contain similar to 1 billion bacterial phylotypes with a Poisson lognormal diversity distribution. Despite this high diversity, activated sludge has a small, global core bacterial community (n = 28 operational taxonomic units) that is strongly linked to activated sludge performance. Meta-analyses with global datasets associate the activated sludge microbiomes most closely to freshwater populations. In contrast to macroorganism diversity, activated sludge bacterial communities show no latitudinal gradient. Furthermore, their spatial turnover is scale-dependent and appears to be largely driven by stochastic processes (dispersal and drift), although deterministic factors (temperature and organic input) are also important. Our findings enhance our mechanistic understanding of the global diversity and biogeography of activated sludge bacterial communities within a theoretical ecology framework and have important implications for microbial ecology and wastewater treatment processes.",2019,4,10.1038/s41564-019-0426-5

To gain an on-site overview of the remote, ultraoligotrophic microbial community of the SPG, we developed a novel on-board analysis pipeline, which combines next-generation sequencing with fluorescence in situ hybridization and automated cell enumeration. We tested the pipeline during the SO-245 UltraPac cruise from Chile to New Zealand and found that the overall microbial community of the SPG was highly similar to those of other oceanic gyres. The SPG was dominated by 20 major bacterial clades, including SAR11, SAR116, the AEGEAN-169 marine group, SAR86, Prochlorococcus, SAR324, SAR406, and SAR202. Most of the bacterial clades showed a strong vertical (20m to 5,000 m), but only a weak longitudinal (80 degrees W to 160 degrees W), distribution pattern. Surprisingly, in the central gyre, Prochlorococcus, the dominant photosynthetic organism, had only low cellular abundances in the upper waters (20 to 80 m) and was more frequent around the 1% irradiance zone (100 to 150 m). Instead, the surface waters of the central gyre were dominated by the SAR11, SAR86, and SAR116 clades known to harbor light-driven proton pumps. The alphaproteobacterial AEGEAN-169 marine group was particularly abundant in the surface waters of the central gyre, indicating a potentially interesting adaptation to ultraoligotrophic waters and high solar irradiance. In the future, the newly developed community analysis pipeline will allow for on-site insights into a microbial community within 35 h of sampling, which will permit more targeted sampling efforts and hypothesis-driven research. IMPORTANCE The South Pacific Gyre, due to its vast size and remoteness, is one of the least-studied oceanic regions on earth. However, both remote sensing and in situ measurements indicated that the activity of its microbial community contributes significantly to global biogeochemical cycles. Presented here is an unparalleled investigation of the microbial community of the SPG from 20- to 5,000-m depths covering a geographic distance of similar to 7,000 km. This insight was achieved through the development of a novel on-board analysis pipeline, which combines next-generation sequencing with fluorescence in situ hybridization and automated cell enumeration. The pipeline is well comparable to onshore systems based on the Illumina platforms and yields microbial community data in less than 35 h after sampling.

Indicator species analysis of fungi found statistical associations of Cenococcum, Wilcoxina, and Rhizopogon to Pinus caribaea. We hypothesize these obligate biotrophic fungi were co-introduced with their host plant. Entoloma was statistically associated with grassland soils, and Fusarium and Lecythophora with soils under cassava. Observed richness varied from 65 (casuarina) to 404 OTUs (cassava) for fungi according to ITS region, and from 1268 (pine) to 2931 OTUs (cassava) for bacteria and archaea. A major finding of this research is that nearly 25% of the fungal OTUs are poorly classified, indicative of novel biodiversity in this region.

"Beyer, JE; Zamor, RM; Hambright, KD",Detection limits affect the predictability of the presence of an invasive harmful alga across geographic space,BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS,"To better comprehend microbial invasions, researchers need more insight into how environmental conditions affect biogeographic patterns in microbes. Recent study suggests that environmental conditions are important predictors for when invasive microbes might become established, actively participating members of a community, but that dispersal also can be important in determining invasion success in conducive environments. In this study, we explored how detection limits affected the ability of a local-scale environmental model to predict the presence of the putative microbial invader Prymnesium parvum at a regional scale. The local-scale model was robust when applied to the regional dataset. Regardless of sensitivity (i.e., minimum detection limit used), P. parvum presence was well predicted by environmental parameters. The highest accuracy was obtained at a detection limit that corresponds with detection limits routinely achieved using standard microscope-based analysis, while lower detection limits typical of molecular approaches worsened the models predictive capabilities. Although many mechanisms may be limiting our ability to predict P. parvum presence at low abundances (e.g., dispersal, source-sink dynamics, methodological limitations), we argue here that environmental filtering plays a role in regulating population growth above these low abundances. The importance of environmental traits in predicting the presence of this microbial species suggests that environmental conditions are critical determinants of the establishment and spread of P. parvum.",2019,21,10.1007/s10530-019-01977-z

This study explored the dynamics of soil bacterial communities during the plant growing season and their interaction with soil carbon and nitrogen, physicochemical properties, plant biomass and diversity following afforestation. The study investigated afforested lands containing Robinia pseudoacacia L (RP) and Caragana korshinskii Kom (CK), as well as abandoned land (AL) and farmland (FL) in the Loess Hilly Region of northern China. After establishment on former FL for 40 years, the Richness and Shannons index, above-ground herbaceous biomass (AGB) and below-ground biomass (BGB) in RP and CK increased by 0.5, 0.1, 1.2 and 1.7 times, respectively, compared with AL. Additionally, the soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), dissolved organic carbon/nitrogen (DOC/N) and microbial biomass carbon/nitrogen (MBC/N) increased by 1.7, 1.9, 0.8 and 2.5 times, respectively, while the soil bacterial abundance and alpha diversity (Shannon index) increased by 4.7% and 2.0% compared with FL. During the growing season, the soil carbon and nitrogen content was higher in August or October than in April or June. Particularly, the AGB, DOC and MBC showed a temporal pattern of normal distribution that was 36.7%, 48.2% and 74.9% higher in August than the rest of the study period. The BGB also increased by 123.5% in October compared with June in all study areas. The soil bacterial abundance in afforested lands was also higher in October, and beta bacterial diversity (Principal coordinates analysis plots: PCoA) was greater in June and August than in April and October. The dominant bacterial taxa, Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes, were significantly higher in afforested lands than in FL, and Proteobacteria increased from April to October, while Actinobacteria and Acidobacteria peaked in June or August. These seasonal changes in the soil bacterial community were significantly correlated with carbon and nitrogen levels of soil and plant biomass, especially with DOC and BGB. Additionally, soil variables explained 41.2% of the total variation in bacterial dominant phyla, while plant biomass only explained 20.2% of it, which indicates that soil properties are more important controlling factors of the bacterial community than plant biomass. In conclusion, soil variables change seasonally, which drives the composition and diversity of the soil bacterial community to exhibit a temporal pattern over the growing season after return of AL to forest.",2019,178,10.1016/j.catena.2019.03.021

This ecosystem also has a great ecological importance, but is highly susceptible to anthropogenic disturbances. The balance of mangrove ecosystem depends largely on the microbial communities in mangrove sediments. Thus, understanding how the mangrove microbial communities respond to spatial differences is essential for more accurate assessment of mangrove ecosystem health. To this end, we performed the first medium-distance (150 km) research on the biogeographic distribution of mangrove microbial communities. The hypervariable regions of 165 rRNA gene was sequenced by Illumina to compare the microbial communities in mangrove sediments collected from six locations (i.e. Zhenzhu harbor, Yuzhouping, Maowei Sea, Qinzhou harbor, Beihai city and Shankou) along the coastline of Beibu Gulf in Guangxi province, China. Collectively, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, Actinobacteria, Parvarchaeota, Acidobacteria and Cyanobacteria were the predominant phyla in the mangrove sediments of this area. At genus level, the heat map of microbial communities reflected similarities between study sites and was in agreement with their biogeographic characteristics. Interestingly, the genera Desulfococcus, Arcobacter, Nitrosopumilus and Sulfurimonas showed differences in abundance between study sites. Furthermore, the principal component analysis (PCA) and unweighted UniFrac cluster tree of beta diversity were used to study the biogeographic diversity of the microbial communities. Relatively broader variation of microbial communities was found in Beihai city and Qinzhou harbour, suggesting that environmental condition and historical events may play an important role in shaping the bacterial communities as well. This is the first report on medium-distance range distribution of bacteria in the mangrove swamp ecosystem. Our data is valuable for monitoring and evaluation of the impact of human activity on mangrove habitats from the perspective of microbiome.",2019,9,10.1038/s41598-019-45804-w

The relative importance of deterministic and stochastic processes for key bacterial and archaeal assemblages (i.e., core-satellite and habitat generalist-specialist) in AS from 13 wastewater treatment plants in China was investigated using 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing. The results obtained indicated 1,388 and 369 core operational taxonomic units (OTUs), 1,038 and 1,683 satellite OTUs, 255 and 48 habitat generalist OTUs, and 192 and 111 habitat specialist OTUs for Bacteria and Archaea, respectively. The proportions of shared OTUs between core and habitat specialist communities were similar to or higher than those between core and habitat generalist communities, suggesting a stronger inter-linkage between the former two groups. Deterministic processes, indicated by abundance-based beta-null models, were responsible for shaping core communities, in which NH4-N, OrgC/OrgN, Cr, and Ni were the main controlling factors. In contrast, satellite communities were predominantly influenced by stochastic processes. Moreover, we found that deterministic and stochastic processes were mainly responsible for shaping the assembly of habitat specialists and generalists, respectively. However, the influence of deterministic factors on habitat specialists remains unclear. The present study provides novel insights into the assembly mechanisms of AS microbial communities.",2019,34,10.1264/jsme2.ME18107

The composition and structure of plant microbiota varies according to plant tissue and compartment, which are specific habitats for microbial colonization. To investigate the structural composition of the microbiome associated with tomato roots under natural systems, we characterized the bacterial, archaeal, and fungal communities of three belowground compartments (rhizosphere, endosphere, and bulk soil) of tomato plants collected from 23 greenhouses in 7 geographic locations of South Korea. The microbial diversity and structure varied by rhizocompartment, with the most distinctive community features found in the endosphere. The bacterial and fungal communities in the bulk soil and rhizosphere were correlated with soil physicochemical properties, such as pH, electrical conductivity, and exchangeable cation levels, while this trend was not evident in the endosphere samples. A small number of core bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) present in all samples from the rhizosphere and endosphere represented more than 60% of the total relative abundance. Among these core microbes, OTUs belonging to the genera Acidovorax, Enterobacter, Pseudomonas, Rhizobium, Streptomyces, and Variovorax, members of which are known to have beneficial effects on plant growth, were more relatively abundant in the endosphere samples. A co-occurrence network analysis indicated that the microbial community in the rhizosphere had a larger and more complex network than those in the bulk soil and endosphere. The analysis also identified keystone taxa that might play important roles in microbe-microbe interactions in the community. Additionally, profiling of predicted gene functions identified many genes associated with membrane transport in the endospheric and rhizospheric communities. Overall, the data presented here provide preliminary insight into bacterial, archaeal, and fungal phylogeny, functionality, and interactions in the rhizocompartments of tomato roots under real-world environments.",2019,9,10.1038/s41598-019-45660-8

Many of Bacillus-like bacteria are demonstrated as beneficial microbes widely used in industry and agriculture. However, the knowledge related to their diversity and distribution patterns in soils is still rudimentary. In this study, we developed a combined research method of using culture-dependent and high-throughput sequencing to investigate the composition and diversity of cultivable Bacillus-like bacterial communities across 26 soil samples obtained from the black soil zone in northeast China. Nearly all bacterial 16S rDNA sequences were classified into the order Bacillales. Fifteen genera were detected, with Bacillus, Paenibacillus, and Brevibacillus being the three most abundant genera. Although more than 2,000 OTUs were obtained across all samples, 33 OTUs were confirmed as the abundant species with a relative abundance over 5% in at least one sample. Pairwise analysis showed that the diversity of Bacillus-like bacterial communities were significantly and positively correlated with soil total carbon contents and soil sampling latitudes, which suggests that a latitudinal gradient diversity of Bacillus-like bacterial communities exists in the black soil zone. The principal coordinates analysis revealed that the Bacillus-like bacterial communities were remarkably affected by soil sampling latitudes and soil total carbon content. In general, this study demonstrated that a distinct biogeographic distribution pattern of cultivable Bacillus-like bacterial communities existed in the black soil zone, which emphasizes that the strategy of local isolation and application of beneficial Bacillus-like strains is rather important in black soil agriculture development.",2019,10,10.3389/fmicb.2019.01424

In this work, the antagonistic interactions among 82 strains belonging to different Pseudomonas species isolated from six different environmental niches have been investigated to check whether it might be related to the environmental niches and/or to the taxonomical affiliation. The bacterial panel included 20 strains from Echinacea purpurea (12 from roots, 8 from the rhizosphere), 19 from Phragmites australis, 20 from the Acquarossa river (13 and 7 from red and black epilithon, respectively), 9 strains from red epilithon of the Infernaccio waterfalls, 5 Antarctic strains, and 9 strains from the Amazon rainforest. Data obtained revealed that 81 out of the 82 strains exhibited an antagonistic activity (even though at a different extent) and that the environmental characteristics, which also determine different adaptative strategies, might be the main factor affecting antagonism among bacteria, even more than taxonomy. Strains isolated from heavy metal enriched river biofilms were described as the most active, while endophytic and rhizospheric strains were the most sensitive. This research, representing the first report in which Pseudomonas bacterial strains isolated from different ecological niches have been tested for their interaction abilities, opens new perspectives in discovering putative new antimicrobial compounds from different (extreme) environments.",2019,31,10.1080/03949370.2019.1621391

Oomycota are a group of fungal-like organisms that comprise a major Glade of eukaryotic life and are parasites of fish, agricultural crops, and algae. The diversity, functionality, and distribution of these organisms are essentially unknown in the Arctic marine environment. Thus, it was our aim to conduct a first screening, using a functional gene assay and high-throughput sequencing of two gene regions within the 18S rRNA locus to examine the diversity, richness, and phylogeny of marine Oomycota within Arctic sediment, seawater, and sea ice. We detected Oomycota at every site sampled and identified regionally localized taxa, as well as taxa that existed in both Alaska and Svalbard. While the recently described diatom parasite Miracula helgolandica made up about 50% of the oomycete reads found, many lineages were observed that could not be assigned to known species, including several that clustered with another recently described diatom parasite, Olpidiopsis drebesii. Across the Arctic, Oomycota comprised a maximum of 6% of the entire eukaryotic microbial community in Barrow, Alaska May sediment and 10% in sea ice near the Svalbard archipelago. We found Arctic marine Oomycota encode numerous genes involved in parasitism and carbon cycling processes. Ultimately, these data suggest that Arctic marine Oomycota are a reservoir of uncharacterized biodiversity, the majority of which are probably parasites of diatoms, while others might cryptically cycle carbon or interface other unknown ecological processes. As the Arctic continues to warm, lower-latitude Oomycota might migrate into the Arctic Ocean and parasitize non-coevolved hosts, leading to incalculable shifts in the primary producer community.",2019,10,10.1186/s43008-019-0006-6

In this study, soils were sampled from 30 grasslands across >2000 km on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau to determine the distribution patterns of methanotrophs and their driving factors at a regional scale. Methanotroph abundance and community composition were analyzed using quantitative PCR and Illumina Miseq sequencing of pmoA genes, respectively. The pmoA gene copies ranged from 8.2 x 10(5) to 1.1 x 10(8) per gram dry soil. Among the 30 grassland soil samples, Upland Soil Cluster Gamma (USC gamma) dominated the methanotroph communities in 26 samples. Jasper Ridge Cluster (JR3) was the most dominant methanotrophic cluster in two samples; while Methylocystis, cluster FWs, and Methylobacter were abundant in other two wet soil samples. Interestingly, reanalyzing the pmoA genes sequencing data from existing publications suggested that USC gamma was also the main methanotrophic cluster in grassland soils in other regions, especially when their mean annual precipitation was <500 mm. Canonical Analysis of Principal Coordinates including all soil samples indicated that the methanotrophic community composition was significantly correlated with local environmental factors, among which mean annual precipitation and pH showed the strongest correlations. Variance partitioning analysis showed that environmental factors and spatial distance were significant factors affecting the community structure of methanotrophs, and environmental properties were more important factors. Collectively, these findings indicate that atmospheric methane may be mainly oxidized by USC gamma in upland soils. They also highlight the key role of water availability and pH in determining the abundance and community profiles of grassland soil methanotrophs. (C) 2019 The Authors.

While there is a pressing need to remediate polluted ecosystems, human intervention might unwittingly oppose selection for natural detoxification, which is primarily carried out by microbes. We test this possibility in the context or a ubiquitous chemical remediation strategy aimed at targeting metal pollution: the addition of lime-containing material. Here, we show that raising pH by liming decreased the availability of toxic metals in acidic mine-degraded soils, hut as a consequence selected against microbial taxa that naturally remediate soil through the production of metal-binding siderophores. Our results therefore highlight the crucial need to consider the eco-evolutionary consequences of human environmental strategies on microbial ecosystem services and other traits.",2019,286,10.1098/rspb.2019.0804

Here, we investigated the diversity and composition of microorganisms in karst and non-karst environments under natural restoration and artificial rehabilitation conditions. The results showed no significant differences in soil microbial diversity, but the microbial communities associated with geological conditions and tree species differed significantly. Variation partitioning analysis (VPA) showed that a total of 77.3% of the variation in bacteria and a total of 69.3% of the variation in fungi could be explained by vegetation type and geological background. There were significant differences in six bacterial classes (Actinobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Ktedonobacteria, TK10, Gammaproteobacteria, and Anaerolineae) and nine fungal classes (Eurotiomycetes, Agaricomycetes, unclassified _p_Ascomycota, Sordariomycetes, Tremellomycetes, norank_k_Fungi, Pezizomycetes, Leotiomycetes and Archaeorhizomycetes) among the soils collected from six plots. A Spearman correlation heatmap showed that the microbial community was affected by the major soil properties.

Absorption coefficients at 254 nm (a(254)) and 325 nm (a(325)), indices (a(254)/a(365)) and spectral slopes (between 275 and 295 nm, S275-295) were calculated from the dissolved fraction of the UV absorption spectra to describe the amount and quality of CDOM. Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) were applied to evaluate the relevance of physical and biogeochemical drivers for the variability of CDOM. Besides the low CDOM values, a first division of our data following the Longhursts biogeographic classification showed significant differences in CDOM levels among provinces. The lowest values of a(254) and a(325) were found in the oligotrophic gyres, particularly in the Indian Ocean, and the highest in the upwelling areas, particularly in the Equatorial Pacific. Opposite distributions were obtained for S275-295 and a(254)/a(365), indicative of higher photobleaching in the gyres. Within each province, whereas a(254) was constant through the photic layer, a(325) increased significantly with depth as a result of the dominance of photobleaching over biological production in the surface layer and the opposite at depth. The Pacific provinces, including the subtropical gyres, showed, however, significantly higher a(325) values, indicative of lower photobleaching/higher biological production. The GAM analysis indicates that a(254) and a(325) were primarily related to chlorophyll a (Chl a), exhibiting a significant positive linear response. Interestingly, Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus abundances were related to these absorption coefficients. Apparent oxygen utilization also contributed to explain the distributions of these absorption coefficients, being inversely related to a(254) and directly related to a(325). These results are consistent with the premise that a(254) could be a proxy for the concentration of dissolved organic carbon and a(325) for the aromatic by-products of biological degradation. The GAM analysis also shows that a(254)/a(365) and S275-295 exhibited inverse relationships with solar radiation, indicating that the biological production of CDOM counteracts photodegradation as solar radiation increases. In summary, whereas photobleaching dictates the vertical distribution of CDOM, Chl a explains the CDOM differences among the photic layer of the tropical and subtropical ocean provinces visited during the circumnavigation.",2019,6,10.3389/fmars.2019.00320

The present study examined the spatial variability of the physicochemical characteristics of an extreme alkaline saline soil and how they controlled the archaeal and bacterial communities so as to determine the main spatial community drivers. Methods: The archaeal and bacterial community structure, and soil characteristics were determined at 13 points along a 211 m transect in the former lake Texcoco. Geostatistical techniques were used to describe spatial patterns of the microbial community and soil characteristics and determine soil properties that defined the prokaryotic community structure. Results: A high variability in electrolytic conductivity (EC) and water content (WC) was found. Euryarchaeota dominated Archaea, except when the EC was low. Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria were the dominant bacterial phyla independent of large variations in certain soil characteristics. Multivariate analysis showed that soil WC affected the archaeal community structure and a geostatistical analysis found that variation in the relative abundance of Euryarchaeota was controlled by EC. The bacterial alpha diversity was less controlled by soil characteristics at the scale of this study than the archaeal alpha diversity. Discussion: Results indicated that WC and EC played a major role in driving the microbial communities distribution and scale and sampling strategies were important to define spatial patterns.",2019,7,10.7717/peerj.6127

Mitochondrial cytb sequence near-identity with sympatric R. robustus (genotype II) raised doubts about the taxonomic status of R. montenegrensis, but comparative studies have reported fairly clear morphological and genetic differences between R. montenegrensis and laboratory stocks identified as R. robustus. Here, we use a transcriptome-based approach to investigate this apparent paradox.ResultsWe retrieved publicly-available transcriptome sequence-reads from R. montenegrensis and from the R. robustus stocks used as the taxonomic benchmark in comparative studies. We (i) aligned transcriptome sequence-reads to mitochondrial (cytb) and nuclear (ITS2, D2-28S and AmpG) query sequences (47 overall) from members of the R. prolixus-R. robustus cryptic-species complex and related taxa; (ii) computed breadth- and depth-coverage for the 259 consensus sequences generated by these alignments; and, for each locus, (iii) appraised query sequences and full-breadth-coverage consensus sequences in terms of nucleotide-sequence polymorphism and phylogenetic relations. We found evidence confirming that R. montenegrensis and R. robustus genotype II are genetically indistinguishable and, hence, implying that they are, in all likelihood, the same species. Furthermore, we found compelling genetic evidence that the benchmark R. robustus stocks used in R. montenegrensis description and in later transcriptome-based comparisons are in fact R. prolixus, although likely mixed to some degree with R. robustus (probably genotype II, a.k.a. R. montenegrensis).ConclusionsWe illustrate how public-domain genetic/transcriptomic data can help address challenging issues in disease-vector systematics. In our case-study, taxonomic confusion apparently stemmed from the misinterpretation of sequence-data analyses and misidentification of taxonomic-benchmark stocks. More generally, and together with previous reports of mixed and/or misidentified Rhodnius spp. laboratory colonies, our results call into question the conclusions of many studies (on morphology, genetics, physiology, behavior, bionomics or interactions with microorganisms including trypanosomes) based on non-genotyped R. prolixus or R. robustus stocks. Correct species identification is a prerequisite for investigating the factors that underlie the physiological, behavioral or ecological differences between primary domestic vectors of Chagas disease, such as R. prolixus, and their sylvatic, medically less-relevant relatives such as R. robustus (s.l.) including R. montenegrensis.",2019,12,10.1186/s13071-019-3558-9

However, the relative contributions of abiotic and biotic factors to soil denitrification potential at the regional and sub-regional scales in grassland ecosystems remain elusive. In this study, soil samples were collected from 21 sites at three steppes of China, including the Inner Mongolia Plateau (IMP), the Xinjiang Autonomous Region (XAR) and the Tibetan Plateau (TP) grasslands. Results showed that the key factors controlling the denitrification potential were regional and scale-dependent. At the sub-regional scales, soil pH, aridity index (AI) and total organic carbon (TOC) explained the highest variances on denitrification potential in the IMP, XAR and TP steppe, respectively. At the regional scale, the mean annual precipitation (MAP) was the most important environmental driver for the denitrification potential. Partial least squares (PLS) path modeling revealed that the MAP might regulate denitrification potential directly and indirectly by its effects on the plant and soil properties. Overall, these results help to improve our understandings on the prediction of the denitrification potential under global changes and revealed that the denitrification potential at various scales could be regulated by the multiple interactions of abiotic and biotic factors.

We further linked the spatial patterns of alpha diversities of putative plant pathogens and EMF to the variation of plant species richness. We found that the relationships between latitude and alpha diversities of putative plant pathogens and EMF were region-dependent with sharp diversity shifts around the mid-latitude (similar to 35 degrees N), which differed from the unimodal diversity distributions of the overall and saprotrophic fungi. The variations in the diversities of putative plant pathogens and EMF were largely explained by the spatial regions (south vs. north/subtropical zone vs. temperate zone). Additionally, the alpha diversities of these two fungal guilds exhibited opposing trends across latitude. EMF could alter the relationship between diversities of putative plant pathogens and plants in the south/subtropical region, but not vice versa. We also found that the ratio of their alpha diversities (EMF to putative plant pathogens) was negatively related to plant species richness across the spatial regions (north to south), and explained similar to 10% of the variation of plant species richness. Overall, our findings suggest that plant-microbe interactions not only shape the local plant diversity but also may have non-negligible contributions to the large-scale patterns of plant diversity in forest ecosystems.",2019,7,10.3389/fevo.2019.00216
"Wu, DM; Dai, QP; Liu, XZ; Fan, YP; Wang, JX",Comparison of bacterial community structure and potential functions in hypoxic and non-hypoxic zones of the Changjiang Estuary,PLOS ONE,"Bacterioplankton play a key role in the global cycling of elements. To characterize the effects of hypoxia on bacterioplankton, bacterial community structure and function were investigated in the Changjiang Estuary. Water samples were collected from three layers (surface, middle, and bottom) at ten sampling sites in the Changjiang Estuary hypoxic and non-hypoxic zones. The community structure was analyzed using high-throughput sequencing of 16S rDNA genes, and the predictive metagenomic approach was used to investigate the functions of the bacterial community. Co-occurrence networks are constructed to investigate the relationship between different bacterioplankton. The results showed that community composition in hypoxic and non-hypoxic zones were markedly different. The diversity and richness of bacterial communities in the bottom layer (hypoxic zone) were remarkably higher than that of the surface layer (non-hypoxic). In the non-hypoxic zone, it was found that Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Flavobacteriia were the dominant groups while Alphaproteobacteria, SAR406 and Deltaproteobacteria were the dominant groups in the hypoxic zone. From the RDA analysis, it was shown that dissolved oxygen (DO) explained most of the bacterial community variation in the redundancy analysis targeting only hypoxia zones, whereas nutrients and salinity explained most of the variation across all samples in the Changjiang Estuary. To understand the genes involved in nitrogen metabolism, an analysis of the oxidation state of nitrogen was performed. The results showed that the bacterial community in the surface layer (non-hypoxic) had more genes involved in dissimilatory nitrate reduction, assimilatory nitrate reduction, denitrification, and anammox, while that in the middle and bottom layers (hypoxic zone) had more abundant genes associated with nitrogen fixation and nitrification. Co-occurrence networks revealed that microbial assemblages in the middle and bottom layers shared more niche spaces than in the surface layer (non-hypoxic zone). The environmental heterogeneity in the hypoxic and non-hypoxic zones might be important environmental factors that determine the bacterial composition in these two zones.",2019,14,10.1371/journal.pone.0217431

The soil microbial community of each land use type has been reported; however, a thorough comparison of the soil microbial ecology of soils from each land use type has not been made. In the current study, soil samples from agricultural-pastoral land, crop land, and an artificial economic forest were collected from Tongliao, Siping, and Yanji, respectively. The structure and composition of bacterial and fungal communities was investigated by a next generation sequencing protocol, and soil physicochemical properties were also determined. Pair-wise analysis showed some soil parameters were significantly different between agricultural-pastoral land and crop land or forest land, while those soil parameters shared more similarities in crop land and forest land soils. Principal coordinates analysis and dissimilarity analyses jointly indicated that bacterial and fungal communities from each sampling site were quite different. Canonical correspondence analysis and a partial Mantel test showed that the community structures of bacteria and fungi were mainly affected by clay, pH, water soluble organic carbon (WSOC), and total soluble nitrogen (TN). Co-occurrence network analysis and the associated topological features revealed that the network of the bacterial community was more complex than that of the fungal community. Clay, pH, WSOC, and NH4+N were major drivers and pH and WSOC were major factors in shaping the network of the bacterial community and the fungal community, respectively. In brief, our results indicated that microbial diversity, co-occurrence network patterns, and their shaping factors differed greatly among soils of distinct land use types in Northeast China. Our data also provided insights into the sustainable use of soils under different land use types.",2019,11,10.3390/su11123286

In temperate climates of the northern hemisphere, plant-root associated bacteria of the genus Frankia are the major nitrogen fixers in forest environments. Trees belonging to the genus Alnus are the most widespread hosts of Frankia in the Pacific Northwest, and a myriad of biotic and abiotic factors can influence the robustness of this symbiosis. Host identity and bacterial strain are important features that can impact Alnus-Frankia association, but little is known about the interplay of intrageneric hosts that co-occur in natural settings. In this study we investigated the genetic diversity and host specificity of Frankia bacteria associated with sympatrically occurring populations of Alnus rubra (red alder) and Alnus rhombifolia (white alder) in Oregon. Based on sequence analysis of the nifty gene recovered from mot nodules we found low overall bacterial diversity. One dominant Frankia genotype was associated with both host species, indicating a lack of strong host specificity in this system. Our results suggest that certain intrageneric plant hosts with overlapping distributions show cross-compatibility with symbiotic actinorhizal bacteria, and that low strain diversity of these bacteria can persist across mixed host populations.",2019,93,10.3955/046.093.0307

Using high-throughput 18S rDNA gene sequencing, we investigated the composition of planktonic microeukaryotes (organisms sampled using a 68-mu m plankton net) in 27 floodplain lakes of the Araguaia River, central Brazil and explored the influence of environmental and spatial factors for communities considering taxonomic and trophic groups. Of the 807 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) observed, Chlorophyta and Charophyta were the groups with greater abundance. Beta diversity was high, and the similarity of communities decreased as the geographic distance increased. We found a shared explanation between environmental and spatial predictors for total and autotrophic microbiota. Environmental variables influence only mixotrophic microbiota. These results suggest an OTU turnover along the floodplain and a spatially structured composition. This spatial pattern can be derived from the association with extrinsic factors, such as spatially structured environmental variables, that generate spatial dependence. However, the relationship between the composition of microbiota and environmental conditions is still unclear.",2019,41,10.1093/plankt/fbz019

However, most of those retrospective studies on microorganisms in archived soils were mainly conducted through PCR-DGGE or T-RFLP analysis, which was less sensitive to low-abundance species. In order to assess whether archived soils could reveal the spatial distribution of microbial communities at large spatial scale, especially the rare microbial taxa, a total of 117 serial time-historical samples from eight long-term field experimental stations of the Chinese Ecosystem Research Network were analyzed using high-throughput sequencing. The non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analyses showed that both the total bacterial communities and the rare bacterial subcommunities were distinctly clustered into different groups corresponding to each experimental station, and that analogous distribution patterns of bacterial communities existed between each two sampling years for both the total and the rare taxa, though the microbial community composition changed over time. The corresponding hierarchical clustering analyses demonstrated that soil bacterial communities for both the total and the rare taxa could be clustered into five groups for all samples and for the sub-samples of each sampling year, which corresponded to five eco-geographic regions in the Eco-Geographic Regional System of China. The results from this investigation highlighted the great value of serial time-archived soils in revealing the spatial distribution patterns of bacterial communities for both the total and the rare taxa at large spatial scale.",2019,133,10.1016/j.soilbio.2019.02.020

In contrast, microbial taxa have been almost neglected or examined without sufficient spatial coverage. Here, we examined the spatial distribution of soil bacterial communities and their relation to local environmental gradients in ice-free regions of the maritime Antarctic. Soils in this region were dominated by Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria, which are typically found in Antarctic soils. Notably, candidate divisions AD3 and WPS-2, which rarely occur in other biomes, were found in high abundance in acidic surface soils. Soil pH and total organic carbon (TOC) were the primary drivers of the bacterial community structure and various geochemical variables also played important roles in structuring bacterial community composition. Bacterial communities were significantly correlated to measured environmental variables, most of which are spatially structured at the local spatial scale (0.5-8 km). This suggests that spatial heterogeneity of environmental factors is an important driver of shifts in bacterial communities. Although various sets of environmental variables were related to bacterial communities, a large proportion of community variation remained unexplained. This indicates that bacterial communities in Antarctic soils may be governed by other biotic or abiotic factors which are not typically measured in other biome studies.",2019,133,10.1016/j.soilbio.2019.03.011

Using a dense sampling strategy, we investigated horizontal variability in total archaeal, Thaumarchaeota Marine Group (MG) I, and Euryarchaeota MGII communities and associations of MGI/MGII with other microbes in surface waters with contrasting environmental characteristics across ~200 km by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Total archaeal communities were extremely dominated by MGI and/or MGII (98.9% in average relative abundance). Niche partitioning between MGI and MGII or within each group was found across multiple environmental gradients. Selection was more important than dispersal limitation in governing biogeographic patterns of total archaeal, MGI, and MGII communities, and basic abiotic parameters (such as salinity) and inorganic/organic resources as a whole could be the main driver of selection. While homogenizing dispersal also considerably governed their biogeography. MGI-Nitrospira assemblages were speculatively responsible for complete nitrification. MGI taxa commonly had negative correlations with members of Synechococcus but positive correlations with members of eukaryotic phytoplankton, suggesting that competition or synergy between MGI and phytoplankton depends on specific MGI-phytoplankton assemblages. MGII taxa showed common associations with presumed (photo)heterotrophs including members of SAR11, SAR86, SAR406, and Candidatus Actinomarina. This study sheds light on ecological processes and drivers shaping archaeal biogeography and many strong MGI/MGII-bacterial associations across complex subtropical coastal waters.

In particular, relating distribution patterns to the underlying ecological processes for plankton communities in highly dynamic ecosystems, such as river-reservoirs subjected to anthropogenic impacts, remains largely unstudied. Here, we analyzed taxonomic distribution patterns, and unraveled community assembly processes underlying the core and random bacterioplankton and microeukaryotes from a subtropical river-reservoir system. These plankton domains were modelled using the spatial abundance distributions (SpADs) of the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) as a proxy for abundant and rare taxa delineation. Both bacterioplankton and microeukaryote plankton communities exhibited significant distance-decay relationships, and samples were grouped depending on reservoir or river habitats. The neutral community model showed that 35-45% of the plankton community variation could be explained by neutral processes. The phylogenetic null model revealed that dispersal limitation accounted for the largest percentage of pairwise comparisons (42-68%), followed by environmental selection (18-25%). We concluded that similar prevalence of ecological processes acting on particular subsets of the bacterioplankton and microeukaryotes might have resulted from similar responses to environmental change, potentially induced by human activities in the watershed.",2019,11,10.3390/w11061127

Results showed prokaryote community compositions differed significantly by elevations. Topsoil or subsoil prokaryote richness and Shannon diversity were significantly lower at the middle than other elevations, while significantly higher aboveground biomass (AGB) and available P (AP) were found at the middle elevation. The importance of P for both soil layers was discovered by variation partitioning analysis based on redundancy analysis, finding that soil AP and total phosphorus, interacted with pH, explained 43% the variance in topsoil prokaryote community compositions, while soil AP, as well as AGB, explained 44% in subsoil. Consistently, structural equation model also revealed that AP was a mediating factor for prokaryote community diversity. Other than plant beta diversity, soil prokaryote beta diversity positively correlated with AP difference significantly. Taken together, the distribution patterns of soil prokaryote community were distinct along elevations even in a small scale in Noijin Kangsang Peak and was likely mediated predominantly by soil AP in both topsoil and subsoil.",2019,95,10.1093/femsec/fiz076

Molecular ecological networks revealed significantly less modules and putative keystone species of bacteria and fungi in swamp than in upland soils.

In some cases, the purpose was to study diversity and evolution of genes that could be grouped within a mechanism of antibiotic resistance. Different protocols have been designed for detection and confirmation that a functional gene was found. In this study, we present a sequence-based screening of candidate genes encoding beta-lactamases in 14 metagenomes of Antarctic microbial mats. The samples were obtained from different sites, representing diverse biogeographic regions of maritime and continental Antarctica. A protocol was designed based on generation of Hidden Markov Models from the four beta-lactamase classes by Ambler classification, using sequences from the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD). The models were used as queries for metagenome analysis and recovered contigs were subsequently annotated using RAST. According to our analysis, 14 metagenomes analyzed contain A, B and C beta-lactamase genes. Class D genes, however, were identified in 11 metagenomes. The most abundant was class C (46.8%), followed by classes B (35.5%), A (14.2%) and D (3.5%). A considerable number of sequences formed clusters which included, in some cases, contigs from different metagenomes. These assemblies are clearly separated from reference clusters, previously identified using CARD beta-lactamase sequences. While bacterial antibiotic resistance is a major challenge of public health worldwide, our results suggest that environmental diversity of beta-lactamase genes is higher than that currently reported, although this should be complemented with gene function analysis.",2019,13,10.1007/s11783-019-1128-1

Here we provide baseline data on planktonic communities of Archaea, Bacteria and microeukaryotes inside and outside (open water habitat) of three marine lakes (Kakaban, Haji Buang and Tanah Bamban) in the Berau region of Indonesia. Compositional variation was highly congruent with the major axis of variation separating open water from marine lake samples for all three domains. Planktonic Archaea mainly consisted of OTUs assigned to Euryarchaeota that were closely related to organisms in Genbank previously obtained from seawater samples. The majority of archaeal OTUs were most abundant in open water habitat with a few OTUs abundant in all habitats. Most bacterial sequences were assigned to Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria and Bacteroidetes with the percentage of Cyanobacteria highest in two of the marine lakes and lowest in the remaining lake (Tanah Bamban). In contrast to Archaea, there were a number of bacterial OTUs that were markedly more abundant in marine lake habitat. Most microeukaryote sequences were assigned to the Alveolata, Stramenopiles, Opisthokonta, Archaeplastida and Hacrobia.

However, the mechanisms underlying the relative influences of the two processes remain elusive. This knowledge gap limits our ability to understand the effects of community assembly processes on microbial community structures and functions. To better understand community assembly mechanisms, the community dynamics of bacterial ecological groups were investigated based on niche breadths in 23 soil plots from subalpine coniferous forests on the Loess Plateau in Shanxi, China. Here, the overall community was divided into the ecological groups that corresponded to habitat generalists, other taxa and specialists. Redundancy analysis based on Bray-Curtis distances (db-RDA) and multiple regression tree (MRT) analysis indicated that soil organic carbon (SOC) was a general descriptor that encompassed the environmental gradients by which the communities responded to, because it can explain more significant variations in community diversity patterns. The three ecological groups exhibited different niche optima and degrees of specialization (i.e., niche breadths) along the SOC gradient, suggesting the presence of a gradient in tolerance for environmental heterogeneity. The inferred community assembly processes varied along the SOC gradient, wherein a transition was observed from homogenizing dispersal to variable selection that reflects increasing deterministic processes. Moreover, the ecological groups were inferred to perform different community functions that varied with community composition, structure.

Community assembly processes occurring in these streams shape downstream population structure and nutrient cycles. To elucidate the development and stability of microbial communities along the length of a first- through third-order stream, fine-scale temporal and spatial sampling regimes were employed along Mc-Nutt Creek in Athens, GA, USA. 16S rRNA amplicon libraries were constructed from samples collected on a single day from 19 sites spanning the first 16.76 km of the stream. To provide context for this spatial study and evaluate temporal variability, selected sites at the streams upper, mid, and lower reaches were sampled daily for 5 days preceding and following the spatial study. In a second study, three sites at and near the creeks headwaters were sampled daily for 11 days to understand initial bacterioplankton community assembly. Both studies revealed decreasing alpha and beta diversity with increasing downstream distance. These trends were accompanied by the enrichment of a small fraction of taxa found at low abundance in headwater-proximal sites. Similar sets of taxa consistently increased in relative abundance in downstream samples over time scales ranging from 1 day to 1 year, many of which belong to clades known to be abundant in freshwater environments. These results underpin the importance of headwaters as the site of rapid in-stream selection that results in the reproducible establishment of a highly stable community of freshwater riverine bacteria. IMPORTANCE Headwater streams are critical introduction points of microbial diversity for larger connecting rivers and play key roles in the establishment of taxa that partake in in-stream nutrient cycling. We examined the microbial community composition of a first- through third-order stream using fine-scale temporal and spatial regimes. Our results show that the bacterioplankton community develops rapidly and predictably from the headwater population with increasing total stream length. Along the length of the stream, the microbial community exhibits substantial diversity loss and enriches repeatedly for select taxa across days and years, although the relative abundances of individual taxa vary over time and space. This repeated enrichment of a stable stream community likely contributes to the stability and flexibility of downstream communities.",2019,85,10.1128/AEM.00188-19

Our results show that each host species shows microbiome compositional specificity, even across PtC, and that alpha diversity does not change significantly across this boundary for any of the gastropod hosts. However, for two of the host species, beta diversity differs significantly across PtC, indicating that there may be multiple levels of organization of the marine gastropod microbiome.

Recent studies pointed out that invasive populations from Europe harbored reduced bacterial microbiota compared to the native populations. Beside bacteria, mosquitoes also contain fungal communities that have so far been largely ignored. To investigate whether the mosquito invasion process displays a similar impact on fungal diversity, we compared the mycobiota structure of three autochthonous mosquito populations in Vietnam and six populations recently introduced in France and Madagascar. All mosquito populations host a locally structured fungal community and carry a core mycobiota dominated by yeasts. However, invasive populations from France and Madagascar harbor a lower fungal diversity compared to Vietnamese populations. These results suggest that similar factors shape the overall composition of the mosquito-associated microbiota during the invasion process as bacterial and fungal communities demonstrate a loss of diversity.

Gene composition and presence of direct terminal repeats in cultivated cobaviruses point toward a genome replication and packaging strategy similar to the T7 phage. Investigation of the genomes suggests that viral lysis of the cell proceeds via the canonical holin-endolysin pathway. Cobaviral hosts include members of the genera Lentibacter, Sulfitobacter and Celeribacter of the Roseobacter group within the family Rhodobacteraceae (Alphaproteobacteria). Screening more than 5,000 marine metagenomes, we found cobaviruses worldwide from temperate to tropical waters, in the euphotic zone, mainly in bays and estuaries, but also in the open ocean. The presence of cobaviruses in protist metagenomes as well as the phylogenetic neighborhood of cobaviruses in glutaredoxin and ribonucleotide reductase trees suggest that cobaviruses could infect bacteria associated with phototrophic or grazing protists. With this study, we expand the understanding of the phylogeny, classification, genomic organization, biogeography and ecology of this phage group infecting marine Rhodobacteraceae.",2019,13,10.1038/s41396-019-0362-7
"Becker, JW; Hogle, SL; Rosendo, K; Chisholm, SW",Co-culture and biogeography of Prochlorococcus and SAR11,ISME JOURNAL,"Prochlorococcus and SAR11 are among the smallest and most abundant organisms on Earth. With a combined global population of about 2.7 x 10(28) cells, they numerically dominate bacterioplankton communities in oligotrophic ocean gyres and yet they have never been grown together in vitro. Here we describe co-cultures of Prochlorococcus and SAR11 isolates representing both high- and low-light adapted clades. We examined: (1) the influence of Prochlorococcus on the growth of SAR11 and vice-versa, (2) whether Prochlorococcus can meet specific nutrient requirements of SAR11, and (3) how co-culture dynamics vary when Prochlorococcus is grown with SAR11 compared with sympatric copiotrophic bacteria. SAR11 grew 15-70% faster in co-culture with Prochlorococcus, while the growth of the latter was unaffected. When Prochlorococcus populations entered stationary phase, this commensal relationship rapidly became amensal, as SAR11 abundances decreased dramatically. In parallel experiments with copiotrophic bacteria; however, the heterotrophic partner increased in abundance as Prochlorococcus densities leveled off. The presence of Prochlorococcus was able to meet SAR11s central requirement for organic carbon, but not reduced sulfur. Prochlorococcus strain MIT9313, but not MED4, could meet the unique glycine requirement of SAR11, which could be due to the production and release of glycine betaine by MIT9313, as supported by comparative genomic evidence. Our findings also suggest, but do not confirm, that Prochlorococcus MIT9313 may compete with SAR11 for the uptake of 3-dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP). To give our results an ecological context, we assessed the relative contribution of Prochlorococcus and SAR11 genome equivalents to those of identifiable bacteria and archaea in over 800 marine metagenomes. At many locations, more than half of the identifiable genome equivalents in the euphotic zone belonged to Prochlorococcus and SAR11 - highlighting the biogeochemical potential of these two groups.",2019,13,10.1038/s41396-019-0365-4

Airborne microbial transport is assumed to occupy a central role in determining dispersal outcomes(2,3), and extra-range dispersal has important implications for predicting ecosystem resilience and response to environmental changes. One of the most pertinent biomes in this regard is Antarctica, given its geographic isolation and vulnerability to climate change and human disturbances. Here, we report microbial diversity in near-ground and high-altitude air above the largest ice-free Antarctic habitat, as well as that of underlying soil microbial communities. We found that persistent local airborne inputs were unable to fully explain Antarctic soil community assembly. Comparison with airborne microbial diversity from high-altitude and non-polar sources suggests that strong selection occurs during long-range atmospheric transport. The influence of selection during airborne transit and at sink locations varied between microbial phyla. Overall, the communities from this isolated Antarctic ecosystem displayed limited connectivity to the non-polar microbial pool, and alternative sources of recruitment are necessary to fully explain extant soil diversity. Our findings provide critical insights into the role of airborne transport limitation in determining microbial biogeographic patterns.",2019,4,10.1038/s41564-019-0370-4

However, there is an increasing interest in capturing relationships among non-pathogenic endosymbionts and exploring their relevance for tick biology. The present study included a total of 1600 adult ticks collected from domestic dogs in 4 different biogeographical regions of Spain. Each pool formed by 1 to 10 halves of individuals representing one specific ticks species was examined by PCR for the presence of Coxiellaceae, Rickettsia spp., Rickettsiales, Wolbachia spp., and other bacterial DNA. Of the pools analyzed, 92% tested positive for endosymbiont-derived DNA. Coxiella spp. endosymbionts were the most prevalent microorganisms, being always present in Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato (s.l.) pools. Rickettsia spp. DNA was detected in 60% of Dermacentor reticulatus pools and 40% of R. sanguineus s.l. pools, with a higher diversity of Rickettsia species in R. sanguineus s.l. pools. Our study reveals a negative relationship of Rickettsia massiliae with the presence of tick-borne pathogens in the same pool of ticks. An additional endosymbiont, Candidatus Rickettsiella isopodorum, was only detected in D. reticulatus pools. Data from this study indicate that dogs in Spain are exposed to several endosymbionts. Due to the importance of tick-borne pathogens, characterizing the role of endosymbionts for tick physiology and prevalence, may lead to novel control strategies.",2019,10,10.1016/j.ttbdis.2019.04.003

Environmental pressures on plants (wind, dust, drought, water, temperature) vary by geography and characterizing the impact of these variable pressures on phyllosphere microbiota will contribute to improved stewardship of fresh produce for both plant and human health. A higher resolution understanding of the incidence of human pathogens on food plants and co-occurring phytobiota using metagenomic approaches (metagenome tracking) may contribute to improved source attribution and risk assessment in cases where human pathogens become introduced to agro-ecologies. Between 1990 and 2007, as many as 1990 culture-confirmed Salmonella illnesses were linked to tomatoes from as many as 12 multistate outbreaks (Bell et al., 2012; Bell et al., 2015; Bennett et al., 2014; CDC, 2004; CDC, 2007; Greene et al., 2005a; Gruszynski et al., 2014). When possible, source attribution for these incidents revealed a biogeographic trend, most events were associated with eastern growing regions. To improve our understanding of potential biogeographically linked trends in contamination of tomatoes by Salmonella, we profiled microbiota from the surfaces of tomatoes from Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina and California. Bacterial profiles from California tomatoes were completely different than those of Maryland, Virginia and North Carolina (which were highly similar to each other). A statistically significant enrichment of Firmicutes taxa was observed in California phytobiota compared to the three eastern states. Rhizobiaceae, Sphingobacteriaceae and Xanthobacteraceae were the most abundant bacterial families associated with tomatoes grown in eastern states. These baseline metagenomic profiles of phyllosphere microbiota may contribute to improved understanding of how certain ecologies provide supportive resources for human pathogens on plants and how components of certain agro-ecologies may play a role in the introduction of human pathogens to plants.",2019,79,10.1016/j.fm.2018.12.001
"Dunivin, TK; Yeh, SY; Shade, A",A global survey of arsenic-related genes in soil microbiomes,BMC BIOLOGY,"Background: Environmental resistomes include transferable microbial genes. One important resistome component is resistance to arsenic, a ubiquitous and toxic metalloid that can have negative and chronic consequences for human and animal health. The distribution of arsenic resistance and metabolism genes in the environment is not well understood. However, microbial communities and their resistomes mediate key transformations of arsenic that are expected to impact both biogeochemistry and local toxicity. Results: We examined the phylogenetic diversity, genomic location (chromosome or plasmid), and biogeography of arsenic resistance and metabolism genes in 922 soil genomes and 38 metagenomes. To do so, we developed a bioinformatic toolkit that includes BLAST databases, hidden Markov models and resources for gene-targeted assembly of nine arsenic resistance and metabolism genes: acr3, aioA, arsB, arsC (grx), arsC (trx), arsD, arsM, arrA, and arxA. Though arsenic-related genes were common, they were not universally detected, contradicting the common conjecture that all organisms have them. From major clades of arsenic-related genes, we inferred their potential for horizontal and vertical transfer. Different types and proportions of genes were detected across soils, suggesting microbial community composition will, in part, determine local arsenic toxicity and biogeochemistry. While arsenic-related genes were globally distributed, particular sequence variants were highly endemic (e.g., acr3), suggesting dispersal limitation. The gene encoding arsenic methylase arsM was unexpectedly abundant in soil metagenomes (median 48%), suggesting that it plays a prominent role in global arsenic biogeochemistry. Conclusions: Our analysis advances understanding of arsenic resistance, metabolism, and biogeochemistry, and our approach provides a roadmap for the ecological investigation of environmental resistomes.",2019,17,10.1186/s12915-019-0661-5

Their apparent ubiquity in acidic terrestrial volcanic areas makes them ideal model organisms to study prokaryotic biogeography. Three Methylacidiphilum species isolated from distantly-separated geothermal regions in Russia, New Zealand, and Italy were previously described. We have explored the intra-taxon phylogenetic patterns of these organisms based on comparative genome analyses and phenotypic comparisons with six new Verrucomicrobia methanotroph isolates from other globally-separated acidic geothermal locations. Comparison of rRNA and particulate methane monooxygenase (pmoCAB) operon sequences indicates a close phylogenetic relationship among the new isolates as well as with the previously characterized strains. All share similar cell morphology including the presence of extensive intracellular inclusion bodies and lack of intracellular membrane systems, which are typical for proteobacterial methanotrophs. However, genome sequence comparisons and concatenated MLST-based phylogenetic analyses separate the new isolates into three distinct species-level groups. Three recently processed isolates from the Azores (each from geographically-separate hot springs within the region) and a single isolate from Iceland are highly similar, sharing more than 88% in silk genome homology with each other as well as with the previous isolate, Methylacidiphilum fumariolicum strain SoIV, from Italy. These appear to constitute a distinct European/Atlantic Glade. However, two of the new isolates - one from the Yellowstone National Park (United States) and another from The Philippines - constitute separate and novel Methylacidiphilum species. There is no clear correlation between fatty acid profiles and geographic distance between origins, or any phylogenetic relationship. Serological analysis using antiserum raised against M. kamchatkense strain Kam 1 revealed large differences in the degree of cross-reactivity with no correlation with other factors. However, the genetic distance between the strains does correlate to the distance between their geographic origins and suggests a global biogeographic pattern shaped by an isolation-by-distance mechanism.

Nonetheless, many factors relating to this highly influential dispersal mechanisms remain unresolved, including the variation in dispersal bacterial communities during stochastic desert dust events, and the effect of aeolian transit over continental and oceanic surfaces to these communities. Here we report a temporal study that encompassed multiple dust events to elucidate 16S rRNA gene-defined changes in airborne bacterial communities at a continental-peninsula site (Yongin, central South Korea) and a downwind offshore island site (Yonago, Honshu Island, Japan) both lying along the trajectory for dust event transport. Aerosol collected on nondust days at both sites generally reflected local origin from freshwater, marine, plant, and animal sources. At both sites, the relative abundance of spore-forming bacteria (Bacillaceae) and organic-aggregating bacteria (Cytophagaceae) was positively correlated with the mineral particle. Actinobacteria increased in relative abundance at the continental-peninsula site during dust events, while marine bacterial signatures (mainly Alphaproteobacteria) were more prevalent in island site after dust events dissipated upon Japanese Sea. Overall, dust events increased the richness of airborne bacteria communities originating from inland desert and other area during early spring and are associated with more variations in airborne bacteria in the island site than the continental-peninsula site. Airborne desert dust is likely a significant transport vehicle for bacteria. The transit of air masses over continental and marine surfaces is selective for some taxa which can be transported to distant sinks with potential impacts toward ecosystems and public health. Plain Language Summary This is the first long-term study for demonstrating microbial transport from desert storms, at the continent-to-island scale. The high throughput approach provides robust support for the key findings: (a) the diversities of airborne bacteria increased with dust dispersals from Chinese desert to the Japanese coast; (b) bacterial taxa include markers associated with desert microbial communities as well as human and plant pathogens were detected; and (c) transit over oceanic waters and anthropogenic polluted areas strongly selects for airborne bacterial populations through atmospheric stressors. These findings have broad relevance to understanding the drivers of global microbial biogeography. The issue of large range microbial transport has a wide-ranging appeal in several areas including microbial ecology, oceanography (ocean-atmospheric interactions), and public health (epidemiology of pathogens).",2019,124,10.1029/2018JD029597

Nevertheless, the diversity of topics explored, and those not well explored, has not been systematically assessed. We conducted a systematic review of the published scientific literature in disease ecology of mammals and subjected the collection of original and review articles identified to a topic modeling approach, which is based on the words used in the published texts and their contexts (i.e., the frequency and strength of their semantic relationships with one another). In addition to concept maps identifying the most prominent research themes, we identified eight (not mutually exclusive) subcategories of studies, including experimental, theoretical, comparative, behavioral, immunological-microbiological, biogeographic-macroecological, vector-focused (e.g., mosquitoes), and disturbance-focused. The most prominent themes arising in review papers included the ecology of zoonotic diseases transmitted from non-human mammals, comparisons of pathogen prevalence between mammalian species, and pathogen discovery-disease surveillance studies, particularly of marine mammals and bats. For the original articles, the most prominent themes included ecology of rodent-transmitted viral and bacterial diseases and the population biology of zoonotic hosts. Most studies used comparative or descriptive approaches to investigate mammal-pathogen-disease relationships at a local scale, focusing on vector-borne diseases. Experimental, modeling, immunological, and behavioral approaches were strikingly underrepresented. Topics of strong conceptual importance, but that are underrepresented in the current literature, include: 1) the effects of the population density of mammalian hosts, and manipulations of density, on pathogen transmission; 2) macroecological studies that quantify effects of mammalian host species on parasite abundance and prevalence; and 3) effects of climate change on physiological and behavioral processes relevant to mammal-parasite interactions.",2019,100,10.1093/jmammal/gyy174

Using the Global Mammal Parasite Database we analysed 17 818 individual geospatial records on 1806 parasite species (encompassing viruses, bacteria, protozoa, arthropods and helminths) that infect 396 carnivore, ungulate and primate host species. As a measure of the geographical extent of each parasite species we quantified the number and area of world ecoregions occupied by each. To evaluate the importance of variables influencing the summed area of ecoregions occupied by a parasite species, we used Bayesian network analysis of a subset (n = 866) of the parasites in our database that had at least two host species and complete information on parasite traits. We found that parasites that covered more geographical area had a greater number of host species, higher average phylogenetic relatedness between host species and more sampling effort. Host and parasite taxonomic groups had weak and indirect effects on parasite ecoregion area; parasite transmission mode had virtually no effect. Mechanistically, a greater number of host species probably increases both the collective abundance and habitat breadth of hosts, providing more opportunities for a parasite to have an expansive range. Furthermore, even though mammals are one of the best-studied animal classes, the ecoregion area occupied by their parasites is strongly sensitive to sampling effort, implying mammal parasites are undersampled. Overall, our results support that parasite geographical extent is largely controlled by host characteristics, many of which are subsumed within host taxonomic identity.",2019,286,10.1098/rspb.2019.0673

Advances in next-generation sequencing have opened new frontiers for discovery programmes for natural products allowing the exploitation of a larger fraction of the microbial community. Polyketide (PK) and non-ribosomal pepetide (NRP) natural products have been reported to be related to compounds with antimicrobial and anticancer activities. We report here a new culture-independent approach to explore bacterial biosynthetic diversity and determine bacterial phyla in the microbial community associated with PK and NRP diversity in selected soils.ResultsThrough amplicon sequencing, we explored the microbial diversity (16S rRNA gene) of 13 soils from Antarctica, Africa, Europe and a Caribbean island and correlated this with the amplicon diversity of the adenylation (A) and ketosynthase (KS) domains within functional genes coding for non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) and polyketide synthases (PKSs), which are involved in the production of NRP and PK, respectively. Mantel and Procrustes correlation analyses with microbial taxonomic data identified not only the well-studied phyla Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria, but also, interestingly, the less biotechnologically exploited phyla Verrucomicrobia and Bacteroidetes, as potential sources harbouring diverse A and KS domains. Some soils, notably that from Antarctica, provided evidence of endemic diversity, whilst others, such as those from Europe, clustered together. In particular, the majority of the domain reads from Antarctica remained unmatched to known sequences suggesting they could encode enzymes for potentially novel PK and NRP.ConclusionsThe approach presented here highlights potential sources of metabolic novelty in the environment which will be a useful precursor to metagenomic biosynthetic gene cluster mining for PKs and NRPs which could provide leads for new antimicrobial metabolites.",2019,7,10.1186/s40168-019-0692-8

Here, we hypothesise that the fungal community plays a key role in coordinating entire microbial communities by controlling the structure of functional networks in sediment. We selected a sediment environment with high niche diversity due to prevalent macrofaunal bioturbation, namely intertidal mangrove sediment, and explored the assembly of bacteria, archaea and fungi in different sediment niches, which we characterised by biogeochemical analysis, around the burrow of a herbivorous crab. We detected a high level of heterogeneity in sediment biogeochemical conditions, and diverse niches harboured distinct communities of bacteria, fungi and archaea. Saprotrophic fungi were a pivotal component of microbial networks throughout and we invariably found fungi to act as keystone species in all the examined niches and possibly acting synergistically with other environmental variables to determine the overall microbial community structure. In consideration of the importance of microbial-based nutrient cycling on overall sediment ecosystem functioning, we underline that the fungal microbiome and its role in the functional interactome cannot be overlooked.",2019,9,10.1038/s41598-019-43980-3
"Lan, GY; Wu, ZX; Li, YW; Chen, BQ",The drivers of soil bacterial communities in rubber plantation at local and geographic scales,ARCHIVES OF AGRONOMY AND SOIL SCIENCE,"According to traditional biogeographic theory, historical contingency can influence soil microbial communities. Thus, we ask: are historical contingencies (soil profiles and geographic sampling locations), or other factors (seasonal changes and soil nutrients), important drivers of soil bacterial communities? This study used high throughput sequencing technology to investigate the soil bacterial compositions of rubber plantations at the local and geographic scales. Significant differences were detected in bacterial compositions between two study locations, Xishuangbanna and Hainan Island. Redundancy analysis showed that the most important factor driving bacterial composition was site location and total nitrogen, which explained 38.2 and 38.4% the total variance, respectively; this indicates that historical contingencies drive distinct bacterial communities in rubber plantation soils. At the local scale, there were also distinct differences in soil bacterial compositions between the dry and rainy season in both the Xishuangbanna and Hainan sites. Seasonal changes explained 13.6 and 41.4% of the total variation of soil bacterial composition in Xishuangbanna and on Hainan Island, respectively, whereas other factors had little effect on soil bacterial communities (p < 0.001). In conclusion, our results demonstrate that historical contingencies drive variation in bacterial composition at the geographic scale, whereas seasonal changes influence variation at the local scale.",2020,66,10.1080/03650340.2019.1616286

Characterizing the global distribution of these symbioses and identifying the factors that control this distribution are thus integral to understanding the present and future functioning of forest ecosystems. Here we generate a spatially explicit global map of the symbiotic status of forests, using a database of over 1.1 million forest inventory plots that collectively contain over 28,000 tree species. Our analyses indicate that climate variables-in particular, climatically controlled variation in the rate of decomposition-are the primary drivers of the global distribution of major symbioses. We estimate that ectomycorrhizal trees, which represent only 2% of all plant species(7), constitute approximately 60% of tree stems on Earth. Ectomycorrhizal symbiosis dominates forests in which seasonally cold and dry climates inhibit decomposition, and is the predominant form of symbiosis at high latitudes and elevation. By contrast, arbuscular mycorrhizal trees dominate in aseasonal, warm tropical forests, and occur with ectomycorrhizal trees in temperate biomes in which seasonally warm-and-wet climates enhance decomposition. Continental transitions between forests dominated by ectomycorrhizal or arbuscular mycorrhizal trees occur relatively abruptly along climate-driven decomposition gradients; these transitions are probably caused by positive feedback effects between plants and microorganisms. Symbiotic nitrogen fixers-which are insensitive to climatic controls on decomposition (compared with mycorrhizal fungi)-are most abundant in arid biomes with alkaline soils and high maximum temperatures. The climatically driven global symbiosis gradient that we document provides a spatially explicit quantitative understanding of microbial symbioses at the global scale, and demonstrates the critical role of microbial mutualisms in shaping the distribution of plant species.",2019,569,10.1038/s41586-019-1128-0

We also evaluated the biotransformation of six antibiotics (amoxicillin, ampicillin, clindamycin, daptomycin, linezolid, and vancomycin) in each enzyme pool because we expect that the kinetics, pathways, and biogeography of antibiotic biotransformations influence the selection of antibiotic resistance within wastewater microbial communities and in downstream environments. Our results demonstrated that biotransformation rate constants varied among the tested antibiotics, and that the observed rank order was consistent across three wastewater treatment plants. Importantly, many of the observed biotransformations eliminated the functional groups associated with antibiotic activity. Furthermore, we found that beta-lactam hydrolysis and daptomycin hydrolysis were catalyzed by enzymes extracted from the EPS, while none of the tested antibiotics were biotransformed by soluble extracellular enzymes. Finally, our results demonstrated that the number of enzyme-catalyzed antibiotic transformations was larger for intracellular than for extracellular enzymes. Together, this study provides novel insights on the kinetics, pathways, and biogeography of antibiotic biotransformations performed by wastewater microbial communities and can be used to inform pathway prediction or the development of biodegradable chemicals.

However, the underlying ecological mechanisms that maintain and regulate the spatial structuring of ectomycorrhizal fungal communities are both complex and remain poorly understood. Here, we use a gradient of mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) induced tree mortality across eleven stands in lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) forests of western Canada to investigate: (i) the degree to which spatial structure varies within this fungal group, and (ii) how these patterns may be driven by the relative importance of tree mortality from changes in understory plant diversity, productivity and fine root biomass following tree death. We found that the homogeneity of the ectomycorrhizal fungal community increased with increasing tree death, aboveground understory productivity and diversity. Whereas, the independent effect of fine root biomass, which declined along the same gradient of tree mortality, increased the heterogeneity of the ectomycorrhizal fungal community. Together, our results demonstrate that large-scale biotic disturbance homogenizes the spatial patterns of ectomycorrhizal fungal communities.",2019,7,10.7717/peerj.6895

However, little is known of the differences in physicochemical and geographical factors influencing the bacterial and eukaryotic communities and of the relative contribution of these two types of predictors in such systems. Here, we investigated the structure and influential factors on bacterial and eukaryotic communities within the river-lake ecosystem sediments using high-throughput DNA sequencing. Numerous physicochemical parameters and geographical locations were measured among 15 sampling sites in the river-lake system of Poyang Lake. Bacterial communities were dominated by Proteobacteria (32.08%), Acidobacteria (16.58%), and Chloroflexi (14.39%), while eukaryotic communities were dominated by Fungi (63.32%) and Alveolata (10.2%). Both bacterial and eukaryotic community structures statistically correlated with C, N, and Fe, but only bacterial community structure significantly correlated with pH, ON, and Fe. Variation partitioning analysis revealed that physicochemical parameters controlled strongly both bacterial and eukaryotic communities, whereas the direct influence of geographical coordinates and a combination of physicochemical parameters and geographical coordinates controlled relatively small.

However, the ecological factors involved in microbial community assembly during the granular biofilm formation are poorly understood, and little is known about the reproducibility of the process. Here, three replicate bioreactors were used to investigate microbial succession during the formation of granular biofilms. We identified three successional phases. During the initial phase, the successional turnover was high and alpha-diversity decreased as a result of the selection of taxa adapted to grow on acetate and form aggregates. Despite these dynamic changes, the microbial communities in the replicate reactors were similar. The second successional phase occurred when the settling time was rapidly decreased to selectively retain granules in the reactors. The influence of stochasticity on succession increased and new niches were created as granules emerged, resulting in temporarily increased alpha-diversity. The third successional phase occurred when the settling time was kept stable and granules dominated the biomass. Turnover was low, and selection resulted in the same abundant taxa in the reactors, but drift, which mostly affected low-abundant community members, caused the community in one reactor to diverge from the other two. Even so, performance was stable and similar between reactors.",2019,53,10.1021/acs.est.8b06669

An understanding of this ecological continuum is of great significance for drawing inferences about the effects of community assembly processes on microbial community structure and function. Here, we investigated the driving forces of soil microbial community assembly in three different environmental contexts located on subalpine coniferous forests of the Loess Plateau in Shanxi, China. The variation in null deviations and phylogenetic analysis showed that a continuum existed between deterministic and stochastic processes in shaping the microbial community structure, but deterministic processes prevailed. By integrating the results of redundancy analysis (RDA), multiple regression tree (MRT) analysis and correlation analysis, we found that soil organic carbon (SOC) was the main driver of the community structure and diversity patterns. In addition, we also found that SOC had a great influence on the community assembly processes. In conclusion, our results show that deterministic processes always dominated assembly processes in shaping bacterial community structure along the three habitat contexts.",2019,7,10.7717/peerj.6746

Here, we used epicPCR (Emulsion, Paired Isolation, and Concatenation PCR) technology to identify the phylogeny of sulfate-reducing prokaryotes (SRP) in sediments from Tibetan Plateau saline lakes. A total of 12,519 OTUs and 883 SRP-OTUs were detected in ten lakes by sequencing of 16S rRNA gene PCR amplicons and epicPCR products of fused 16S rRNA plus dsrB gene, respectively, with Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes being the dominant phyla in both datasets. The 120 highly abundant SRP-OTUs (>1% in at least one sample) were affiliated with 17 described phyla, only 7 of which are widely recognized as SRP phyla. The majority of OTUs from both the whole microbial communities and the SRPs were not detected in more than one specific lake, suggesting high levels of endemism. The -diversity of the entire microbial community and SRP sub-community showed significant positive correlations. The pH value and mean water temperature of the month prior to sampling were the environmental determinants for the whole microbial community, while the mean water temperature and total nitrogen were the major environmental drivers for the SRP sub-community.

The dormant endospore phenotype confers resistance to unfavorable environmental conditions, allowing dispersal to be isolated and studied independently of other factors such as environmental selection. To study the resilience of thermospores to conditions relevant for survival in extreme cold conditions, their viability following different freezing treatments was tested. Marine sediment was frozen at either -80 degrees C or -20 degrees C for 10 days prior to pasteurization and incubation at � degrees C for 21 days to assess thermospore viability. Sulfate reduction commenced at � degrees C following both freezing pretreatments indicating persistence of thermophilic endospores of sulfate-reducing bacteria. The onset of sulfate reduction at � degrees C was delayed in -80 degrees C pretreated microcosms, which exhibited more variability between triplicates, compared to -20 degrees C pretreated microcosms and parallel controls that were not frozen in advance. Microbial communities were evaluated by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, revealing an increase in the relative sequence abundance of thermophilic endospore-forming Firmicutes in all microcosms. Different freezing pretreatments (-80 degrees C and -20 degrees C) did not appreciably influence the shift in overall bacterial community composition that occurred during the � degrees C incubations. Communities that had been frozen prior to � degrees C incubation showed an increase in the relative sequence abundance of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) affiliated with the class Bacilli, relative to unfrozen controls. These results show that freezing impacts but does not obliterate thermospore populations and their ability to germinate and grow under appropriate conditions. Indeed the majority of the thermospore OTUs detected in this study (21 of 22) could be observed following one or both freezing treatments. These results are important for assessing thermospore viability in frozen samples and following cold exposure such as the very low temperatures that would be encountered during panspermia.",2019,10,10.3389/fmicb.2019.00945

This subtropical island is characterized by long, hot, humid summers, and short, mild, dry winters. All sites were dominated by Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria, and Firmicutes; microbial community composition was similar across four seasons. However, larger proportions of Gammaproteobacteria and Bacillus were observed during the summer than during any other season. The high ratio of Bacillus, Bacteroidetes, and Clostridia richness to Alphaproteobacteria richness in the summer, suggested that the sites we tested were heavily affected by waste water to other seasons. Correlation-based network analyses among the bacterial species and environmental variables indicated important connections between physiochemical variables and specific taxonomic groups.

"Kumar, A; Sperandio, V",Indole Signaling at the Host-Microbiota-Pathogen Interface,MBIO,"Microbial establishment within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract requires surveillance of the gut biogeography. The gut microbiota coordinates behaviors by sensing host-or microbiota-derived signals. Here we show for the first time that microbiota-derived indole is highly prevalent in the lumen compared to the intestinal tissue. This difference in indole concentration plays a key role in modulating virulence gene expression of the enteric pathogens enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) and Citrobacter rodentium. Indole decreases expression of genes within the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) pathogenicity island, which is essential for these pathogens to form attaching and effacing (AE) lesions on enterocytes. We synthetically altered the concentration of indole in the GI tracts of mice by employing mice treated with antibiotics to deplete the microbiota and reconstituted with indole-producing commensal Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (B. theta) or a B. theta Delta tnaA mutant (does not produce indole) or by engineering an indole-producing C. rodentium strain. This allowed us to assess the role of self-produced versus microbiota-produced indole, and the results show that decreased indole concentrations promote bacterial pathogenesis, while increased levels of indole decrease bacterial virulence gene expression. Moreover, we identified the bacterial membranebound histidine sensor kinase (HK) CpxA as an indole sensor. Enteric pathogens sense a gradient of indole concentrations in the gut to probe different niches and successfully establish an infection. IMPORTANCE Pathogens sense and respond to several small molecules within the GI tract to modulate expression of their virulence repertoire. Indole is a signaling molecule produced by the gut microbiota. Here we show that indole concentrations are higher in the lumen, where the microbiota is present, than in the intestinal tissue. The enteric pathogens EHEC and C. rodentium sense indole to downregulate expression of their virulence genes, as a read-out of the luminal compartment. We also identified the bacterial membrane-bound HK CpxA as an indole sensor. This regulation ensures that EHEC and C. rodentium express their virulence genes only at the epithelial lining, which is the niche they colonize.",2019,10,10.1128/mBio.01031-19

Here, we introduce 12 new draft genomes of marine Synechococcus isolates spanning five clades and utilize similar to 100 environmental metagenomes largely sourced from the TARA Oceans project to assess the global distributions of the genomic lineages they and other reference genomes represent. We show that five newly provided clade-II isolates are by far the most representative of the recovered in situ populations (most abundant) and have biogeographic distributions distinct from previously available clade-II references. Additionally, these isolates form a subclade possessing the smallest genomes yet identified of the genus (2.14 � 0.05Mbps; mean � 1SD) while concurrently hosting some of the highest GC contents (60.67 � 0.16%). This is in direct opposition to the pattern in Synechococcuss nearest relative, Prochlorococcus - wherein decreasing genome size has coincided with a strong decrease in GC content - suggesting this new subclade of Synechococcus appears to have convergently undergone genomic reduction relative to the rest of the genus, but along a fundamentally different evolutionary trajectory.",2019,21,10.1111/1462-2920.14552

However, few studies have explored how the concentration of atmospheric oxygen affects the gut microbiota in natural populations. High-altitude environments provide an opportunity to study the potential effects of atmospheric oxygen on the composition and function of the gut microbiota. Here, we characterized the caecal microbial communities of wild house mice (Mus musculus domesticus) in two independent altitudinal transects, one in Ecuador and one in Bolivia, from sea level to nearly 4,000 m. First, we found that differences in altitude were associated with differences in the gut microbial community after controlling for the effects of body mass, diet, reproductive status and population of origin. Second, obligate anaerobes tended to show a positive correlation with altitude, while all other microbes tended to show a negative correlation with altitude. These patterns were seen independently in both transects, consistent with the expected effects of atmospheric oxygen on gut microbes. Prevotella was the most-enriched genus at high elevations in both transects, consistent with observations in high-altitude populations of pikas, ruminants and humans, and also consistent with observations of laboratory mice exposed to hypoxic conditions. Lastly, the renin-angiotensin system, a recently proposed microbiota-mediated pathway of blood pressure regulation, was the top predicted metagenomic pathway enriched in high altitudes in both transects. These results suggest that high-altitude environments affect the composition and function of the gut microbiota in wild mammals.",2019,28,10.1111/mec.14905
"Mainali, K; Bewick, S; Vecchio-Pagan, B; Karig, D; Fagan, WF",Detecting interaction networks in the human microbiome with conditional Granger causality,PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY,"Human microbiome research is rife with studies attempting to deduce microbial correlation networks from sequencing data. Standard correlation and/or network analyses may be misleading when taken as an indication of taxon interactions because correlation is neither necessary nor sufficient to establish causation; environmental filtering can lead to correlation between non-interacting taxa. Unfortunately, microbial ecologists have generally used correlation as a proxy for causality although there is a general consensus about what constitutes a causal relationship: causes both precede and predict effects. We apply one of the first causal models for detecting interactions in human microbiome samples. Specifically, we analyze a long duration, high resolution time series of the human microbiome to decipher the networks of correlation and causation of human-associated microbial genera. We show that correlation is not a good proxy for biological interaction; we observed a weak negative relationship between correlation and causality. Strong interspecific interactions are disproportionately positive, whereas almost all strong intraspecific interactions are negative. Interestingly, intraspecific interactions also appear to act at a short timescale causing vast majority of the effects within 1-3 days. We report how different taxa are involved in causal relationships with others, and show that strong interspecific interactions are rarely conserved across two body sites whereas strong intraspecific interactions are much more conserved, ranging from 33% between the gut and right-hand to 70% between the two hands. Therefore, in the absence of guiding assumptions about ecological interactions, Granger causality and related techniques may be particularly helpful for understanding the driving factors governing microbiome composition and structure. Author summary The human microbiome comprises thousands of microbial taxa, each of them potentially having interactions with many other taxa. Elucidating these interactions can be helpful for human health and beyond. The most conclusive approach for understanding microbial interactions would be myriads of controlled experiments in laboratory settings, each designed to test how taxa interact with one another. As this is a formidable challenge, an alternative strategy for constructing such an interaction network is a statistical framework employing formal models. Using conditional Granger causality, we demonstrate that correlation measures, which are very popular statistics in microbiome studies, are unreliable as proxies of microbial interactions. Overall, we found that strong interactions within a genus tended to be negative (e.g., competition), and they tended to occur on very short timescales (1-2 days). Many of such interactions were common across body sites. By contrast, strong interactions between genera tended to be positive (e.g., mutualism/facilitation) and were more evenly distributed over a range of timescales, up to the 20-day window that we considered. Very few of these interactions were conserved across body sites. We conclude that models of causality can be particularly useful in elucidating microbial interaction networks when laboratory investigations of interactions are impractical.",2019,15,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007037

Drought is the major stress in this region which limits productivity. Microbial communities in the rhizosphere are of special importance to stress tolerance. However, relatively little is known about the relationship between drought and microbial communities in peanuts. Method: In this study, deep sequencing of the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was performed to characterize the microbial community structure of drought-treated and untreated peanuts. Results: Taxonomic analysis showed that Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Saccharibacteria, Chloroflexi, Acidobacteria and Cyanobacteria were the dominant phyla in the peanut rhizosphere. Comparisons of microbial community structure of peanuts revealed that the relative abundance of Actinobacteria and Acidobacteria dramatically increased in the seedling and podding stages in drought-treated soil, while that of Cyanobacteria and Gemmatimonadetes increased in the flowering stage in drought-treated rhizospheres. Metagenomic profiling indicated that sequences related to metabolism, signaling transduction, defense mechanism and basic vital activity were enriched in the drought-treated rhizosphere, which may have implications for plant survival and drought tolerance. Conclusion: This microbial communities study will form the foundation for future improvement of drought tolerance of peanuts via modification of the soil microbes.",2019,20,10.3390/ijms20092265

We investigated (Illumina MiSeq) snow-borne bacterial, fungal, and algal communities across a latitudinal gradient in Fennoscandia and inter-continental distribution between northern Europe and North America. Our data indicate that bacterial communities are ubiquitous regionally (across Fennoscandia), whereas fungal communities are regionally heterogeneous. Both fungi and bacteria are biogeographically heterogeneous inter-continentally. Snow algae, generally thought to occur in colorful algae blooms (red, green, or yellow) on the snow surface, are molecularly described here as an important component of snows even in absence of visible algal growth. This suggests that snow algae are a previously underestimated major biological component of visually uncolonized snows. In contrast to fungi and bacteria, algae exhibit no discernible inter-continental or regional community structure and exhibit little endemism. These results indicate that global and regional snow microbial communities and their distributions may be dictated by a combination of size-limited propagule dispersal potential and restrictions (bacteria and fungi) and homogenization of ecologically specialized taxa (snow algae) across the globe. These results are among the first to compare inter-continental snow microbial communities and highlight how poorly understood microbial communities in these threatened ephemeral ecosystems are.",2019,77,10.1007/s00248-019-01357-z

Bacterioplankton community structures from nine global estuaries were compared to understand their broad-scale biogeographic patterns. Bacterioplankton community structure from four estuaries of Sundarbans, namely Mooriganga, Thakuran, Matla, and Harinbhanga, was elucidated using Illumina sequencing. Bacterioplankton communities from these estuaries were compared against available bacterioplankton sequence data from Columbia, Delaware, Jiulong, Pearl, and Hangzhou estuaries. All nine estuaries were dominated by Proteobacteria. Other abundant phyla included Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Planctomycetes, and Verrucomicrobia. The abundant bacterial phyla showed a ubiquitous presence across the estuaries. At class level, the overwhelming abundance of Gammaproteobacteria in the estuaries of Sundarbans and Columbia estuary clearly stood out amidst high abundance of Alphaproteobacteria observed in the other estuaries. Abundant bacterial families including Rhodobacteriaceae, Shingomonadaceae, Acidobacteriaceae, Vibrionaceae, and Xanthomondaceae also showed ubiquitous presence in the studied estuaries. However, rare taxa including Chloroflexi, Tenericutes, Nitrospirae, and Deinococcus-Thermus showed clear site-specific distribution patterns. Such distribution patterns were also reinstated by nMDS ordination plots. Such clustering patterns could hint toward the potential role of environmental parameters and substrate specificity which could result in distinct bacterioplankton communities at specific sites. The ubiquitous presence of abundant bacterioplankton groups along with their strong correlation with surface water temperature and dissolved nutrient concentrations indicates the role of such environmental parameters in shaping bacterioplankton community structure in estuaries.

Based on the redundant analysis and multi-linear regression model, location, specific microbial taxa, number of livestock and health facilities significantly influenced the ARG profile in drinking water sources. Besides the cluster effect of ARG in samples from plain and bedrock mountain areas, the samples from fracture aquifer areas also showed a distinctive biogeographic pattern with that from porous aquifer areas. Putative ARGs host Opitutus and Flavobacterium were the enriched biomarkers in plain and fracture aquifer area respectively, which mainly carried bacitracin, multidrug, beta-lactam and tetracycline ARGs. This result illuminated that both natural background and anthropogenic activities in the watershed influenced the ARG profile in natural freshwater system significantly. The low MGEs abundance and absence of pathogen revealed a low ARG dissemination risk in sampled drinking water sources, while Polynucleobacter was an abundant ARGs host and was significantly related to the ARG profile, which indicated that specific bacteria was responsible for ARGs propagation and accumulation in surface freshwater system.

Most studies use fecal samples as a proxy for the intestinal microbiota; however, the fecal microbiome is not fully representative of the mucosa-associated microbiota at the site of disease.

We also employed a simple bioinformatics workflow to remove contaminants from 16S rRNA gene profiling results. RESULTS: Our results indicate that the microbial differences between individuals are greater than those between different microenvironments within the same individual.

Here, we use a trait-based approach to quantify the niches of 23 species of basidiomycete wood decay fungi from across North America, and explore the linkages among functional trait expression, climate and phylogeny. Our analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off between abiotic stress tolerance and competitive ability, whereby fungi with wide thermal and moisture niches exhibit lower displacement ability. The magnitude of this dominance-tolerance trade-off is partially related to the environmental conditions under which the fungi were collected, with thermal niche traits exhibiting the strongest climate relationships. Nevertheless, moisture and thermal dominance-tolerance patterns exhibited contrasting phylogenetic signals, suggesting that these trends are influenced by a combination of niche sorting along taxonomic lines in tandem with acclimation and adaptation at the level of the individual.

A coloniser of low nutrient (N) soils, it supports biodiversity such as key moth and butterfly species, and its roots are known for their organoleptic and claimed therapeutic properties. Thus, the species has high potential for restoration, conservation, novel cropping and as a model species. The last because of its genetic synteny with important pulse crops. However, regeneration and functional attributes of L. linifolius remain to be characterised. Seeds of L. linifolius were characterised using physical, colorimetric and chemical data. Ultrastructural and functional characterisation of the N-fixing root nodules included immunolabelling with nifH protein antibodies (recognising the N-fixing enzyme, nitrogenase). Endosymbiotic bacteria were isolated from root nodules and characterised phylogenetically using 16S rRNA, nodA and nodD gene sequences. L. linifolius yielded heteromorphic seed of distinct colour classes: green and brown. Seed morphotypes had similar C:N ratios and were equally germinable (ca. 90%) after scarification at differing optimal temperatures (16 and 20 degrees C).

At five sites in the Atlantic Ocean, we investigated the processing of organic matter by tracking changes in microbial community composition as HMW polysaccharides were enzymatically hydrolysed over time. During this investigation, we discovered that a considerable fraction of heterotrophic bacteria uses a newly-identified selfish mode of substrate processing. We therefore additionally examined the balance of individual substrate utilisation mechanisms at different locations by linking individual microorganisms to distinct substrate utilisation mechanisms. Through FISH and uptake of fluorescently-labelled polysaccharides, selfish organisms were identified as belonging to the Bacteroidetes, Planctomycetes and Gammaproteobacteria. Sharing (extracellular enzyme producing) and scavenging (non-enzyme producing) organisms predominantly belonged to the Alteromonadaceae and SAR11 clades, respectively. The extent to which individual mechanisms prevail depended on the initial population structure of the bacterial community at a given location and time, as well as the growth rate of specific bacteria. Furthermore, the same substrate was processed in different ways by different members of a pelagic microbial community, pointing to significant follow-on effects for carbon cycling.",2019,13,10.1038/s41396-018-0326-3

Microbial communities are normally composed of a few abundant and many rare taxa. Abundant and rare taxa play different ecological roles in kinds of environments, but how their diversity and composition patterns response to elevation gradients is still poorly elucidated. In this study, we investigated the elevational patterns of abundant and rare bacterial diversity and composition in a mountain stream from 712 to 3435 m at Gangrigabu Mountain on the Tibetan Plateau, China. Our results revealed abundant and rare bacteria had similar decreasing elevation trend of alpha diversity, and both of them showed a significant elevational distance-decay relationship. However, the turnover rate of the elevational distance-decay of rare bacteria was higher than that of abundant bacteria. The species-abundance distribution patterns of rare taxonomic composition were associated with the elevational gradient, while most of abundant bacterial clades did not display any relationships with elevation. Our results suggested that rare bacteria were more sensitive to changes in elevation gradient.",2019,62,10.1007/s11430-018-9316-6

However, the links between soil microbial communities, soil abiotic properties, plant functional traits in the case of semi-arid and arid ecosystems, are unclear. In this study, we investigated the changes in soil microbial species diversity and community composition, and the corresponding effects of soil abiotic properties and plant functional traits, during a >= 150-year secondary forest succession on the Loess Plateau, which represents a typical semi-arid ecosystem in China. Plant community fragments were assigned to six successional stages: 1-4, 4-8, 8-15, 15-50, 50-100, and 100-150 years after abandonment. Bacterial and fungal communities were analyzed by high-throughput sequencing of the V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS2) region of the rRNA operon, respectively. A multivariate variation-partitioning approach was used to estimate the contributions of soil properties and plant traits to the observed microbial community composition. We found considerable differences in bacterial and fungal community compositions between the early (S1-S3) and later (S4-S6) successional stages. In total, 18 and 12 unique families were, respectively, obtained for bacteria and fungi, as indicators of microbial community succession across the six stages. Bacterial alpha diversity was positively correlated with plant species alpha diversity, while fungal diversity was negatively correlated with plant species diversity. Certain fungal and bacterial taxa appeared to be associated with the occurrence of dominant plant species at different successional stages. Soil properties (pH, total N, total C, NH4-N, NO3-N, and PO4-P concentrations) and plant traits explained 63.80% and 56.68% of total variance in bacterial and fungal community compositions, respectively. These results indicate that soil microbial communities are coupled with plant communities via the mediation of microbial species diversity and community composition over a long-term secondary forest succession in the semi-arid ecosystem. The bacterial and fungal communities show distinct patterns in response to plant community succession, according to both soil abiotic properties and plant functional traits.",2019,10,10.3389/fmicb.2019.00895

These differences have been attributed to between-population differences in host behaviours, environments, genetics and geographical distance. However, which factors are most important remains unknown. Here, we fill this gap for baboons by leveraging information on 13 environmental variables from 14 baboon populations spanning a natural hybrid zone. Sampling across a hybrid zone allowed us to additionally test whether phylosymbiosis (codiversification between hosts and their microbiota) is detectable in admixed, closely related primates. We found little evidence of genetic effects: none of host genetic ancestry, host genetic relatedness nor genetic distance between host populations were strong predictors of baboon gut microbiota. Instead, gut microbiota were best explained by the baboons environments, especially the soils geologic history and exchangeable sodium. Indeed, soil effects were 15 times stronger than those of host-population F-ST, perhaps because soil predicts which foods are present, or because baboons are terrestrial and consume soil microbes incidentally with their food. Our results support an emerging picture in which environmental variation is the dominant predictor of host-associated microbiomes. We are the first to show that such effects overshadow host species identity among members of the same primate genus.",2019,286,10.1098/rspb.2019.0431

For the most part Aa conducts its business by utilizing strategies allowing it to conceal itself below the radar of the host mucosal immune defense system. A great deal of misinformation has been conveyed with respect to Aa biology in health and disease. The purpose of this review is to present misconceptions about Aa and the strategies that it uses to colonize, survive, and evade the host. In the process Aa manages to undermine host mucosal defenses and contribute to disease initiation. This review will present clinical observational, molecular, and interventional studies that illustrate genetic, phenotypic, and biogeographical tactics that have been recently clarified and demonstrate how Aa survives and suppresses host mucosal defenses to take part in disease pathogenesis. At one point in time Aa was considered to be the causative agent of Localized Aggressive Periodontitis. Currently, it is most accurate to look at Aa as a community activist and necessary partner of a pathogenic consortium that suppresses the initial host response so as to encourage overgrowth of its partners. The data for Aa s activist role stems from molecular genetic studies complemented by experimental animal investigations that demonstrate how Aa establishes a habitat (housing), nutritional sustenance in that habitat (food), and biogeographical mobilization and/or relocation from its initial habitat (transportation). In this manner Aa can transfer to a protected but vulnerable domain (pocket or sulcus) where its community activism is most useful. Aas strategy includes obtaining housing, food, and transportation at no cost to its partners challenging the economic theory that there aint no such thing as a free lunch. This strategy illustrates how co-evolution can promote Ms survival, on one hand, and overgrowth of community members, on the other, which can result in local host dysbiosis and susceptibility to infection.",2019,10,10.3389/fimmu.2019.00728

There are growing concerns regarding the influences of successive planting of Eucalyptus urophylla on microorganisms and soil. The aim of this work was to determine the effects of the successive planting of E. urophylla on soil characteristics. Five different stands, including 5-, 10-, 15-, and 18-year-old E. urophylla plantations (abbreviated as 5yr, 10yr, 15yr, and 18yr, respectively) and one native evergreen broadleaf forest as a 0-year-old E. urophylla plantation (abbreviated as CK) were used. All of measured chemical indicators, microbial biomass, and enzyme activities were significantly lower in E. urophylla plantations compared with CK stand. The microbial biomass and enzyme activities significantly decreased in 5yr stand, significantly increased in 10yr stand, and subsequently declined in 15yr and 18yr stands. The relative abundance of Ascomycota in 15yr (77.10%) and 18yr (72.71%) plantations was significantly higher than in other stands. Basidiomycota relative abundance in the E. urophylla plantations was significantly lower than in the CK stand. In addition, the bacterial diversity was significantly decreased in 15yr and 18yr stands, whereas the fungal diversity was the lowest in 5yr stand and significantly increased in 10yr, 15yr, and 18yr stands. Furthermore, structural equation modelling showed that successive planting of E. urophylla decreased the soil bacterial community diversity, microbial biomass, and enzyme activity but increased the fungal community diversity. Thus, successive planting of E. urophylla negatively influenced the soil bacterial diversity, microbial biomass, and enzyme activity and positively influenced soil fungal diversity.",2019,30,10.1002/ldr.3249

The study is based on fungal communities colonizing standardized plant litter in 19 globally distributed stream locations between 69 degrees N and 44 degrees S. Fungal richness suggests a hump-shaped distribution along the latitudinal gradient. Strikingly, community composition of fungi was more clearly related to thermal preferences than to biogeography.

In-situ monitoring and 18S rRNA gene sequencing were used to investigate spatiotemporal variations of eukaryotic community in three types of watershed with different dominant land use type (i.e. urban, forest, and natural) during three seasons (i.e. dry, transition, and wet seasons) in a coastal watershed of Southeast China. Results showed that agricultural and urban watersheds had significantly higher diversity in dry and transition seasons, and higher richness in transition and wet seasons than those in forest watershed. The non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis further verified great spatiotemporal variations of eukaryotic community. Stramenopiles, Alveolata, Animalia, and Eukaryota, dominated the sequences reads for all sampling sites in three seasons. Agricultural watershed had the highest relative abundant of Animalia, whereas Eukaryota was the most abundant in urban watershed and forest watershed had the highest relative abundance of Stramenopiles and Alveolata. The RDA ordination showed that Builtup and streamflow were two most important factors for moderate taxa and abundant taxa, respectively. Variation partitioning revealed that land use pattern and hydrological regime together explained 54.4%, 61% and 67.2% variances of the composition of eukaryotic community. Among three sampling seasons, the relative contribution of land use pattern was higher than that of hydrological regime. The results of this investigation demonstrated how land use pattern and hydrological regime affected the composition and diversity of riverine eukaryotic community. The findings can provide a useful insight into the riverine eukaryotic communities and their underlying ecological mechanisms in coastal China watersheds. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, factors determining variations in fungal diversity and their biogeographic patterns in this rigorously affected landscape area remain poorly understood. Therefore, we performed Illumina MiSeq high throughput sequencing of the fungal specific, internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) region from 24 representative soils covering forest, grassland and agricultural lands from 8 distinct landscapes. Using this technique, we demonstrate that fungal members belonging to phylum Ascomycota dominated in all soils investigated in this study with an average relative abundance higher than 80%. High fungal richness in the Loess Plateau soils is ascribed to the retrieval of 1,822,499 quality sequences belonging to 13,533 different phylotypes. However, this richness/phylotype number decreased (from 779 to 561) with increasing longitudinal gradient through 107 degrees 39 to 109 degrees 36. Interestingly, higher fungal diversity (in terms of presence of diverse fungal taxa) occurred as microbial biomass carbon (MBC) concentration decreased (approximately from 500 to 100 mg kg(-1)) in soils. Variation partitioning analysis revealed that geographic distance contributed more to fungal community variation (38.3%) than soil properties (22.2%) at the landscape level (similar to 400 km). As indicated by non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS), among soil properties, concentrations of MBC primarily affected (significantly corrected with NMDS 1; r = 0.620; p < 0.01) fungal community structure in the current study. This study therefore constitutes an essential set of information and recommends usage of information on fungal community structure as a potential ecological indicator of the Loess Plateau region.

Caulerpa is also host to a rich diversity of bacterial endo- and epibionts. The degree to which these bacterial communities are species-, or even niche-specific remains largely unknown. To address this, we investigated the diversity of bacteria associated to different morphological niches of both native and invasive species of Caulerpa from different geographic locations along the Turkish coastline of the Aegean sea. Associated bacteria were identified using the 16S rDNA marker gene for three morphological niches, such as the endobiome, epibiome, and rhizobiome. Bacterial community structure was explored and deterministic factors behind bacterial variation were investigated. Of the total variation, only 21 .5% could be explained. Pronounced differences in bacterial community composition were observed and variation was partly explained by a combination of host species, biogeography and nutrient levels. The majority of the explained bacterial variation within the algal holobiont was attributed to the micro-environments established by distinct morphological niches. This study further supports the hypothesis that the bacterial assembly is largely stochastic in nature and bacterial community structure is most likely linked to functional genes rather than taxonomy.",2019,10,10.3389/fmicb.2019.00717

Nine novel A-layer types (15-23) are identified, several of which display a strong predilection towards certain fish hosts, including e.g. Cyprinidae and Pleuronectidae species. Moreover, we find indications that anthropogenic transport of live fish may have aided the near global dissemination of two cyprinid-associated A-layer types. Comparison of whole genome phylogeny and A-layer typing for a subset of strains further resulted in compatible tree topologies, indicating the utility of vapA as a phylogenetic as well as an epizootiological marker in A. salmonicida. A Microreact project (microreact.org/project/r1pcOAx9m) has been created, allowing public access to the vapA analyses and relevant metadata.

MethodsA total of 77 soil samples were collected along NE-SW (60km) and E-W (160km) transects from within a 4,000km(2) area of the Namib Desert gravel plains. We extracted 434 springtails from the 37 samples which contained Collembola and sequenced them at the COI gene locus. In the absence of specific taxonomic keys and previous genetic data for these taxa, we used Generalized Mixed Yule Coalescent (GMYC) analyses to provide putative species-level designations. ResultsWe obtained 341 successful COI sequences, 175 of which were unique haplotypes. GMYC analyses identified 30 putative species, with up to 28% sequence divergence (uncorrected p-distance). The distribution of genetic variants was disjunct, with 97% of haplotypes and 70% of GMYC species found only at single sites. Main conclusionsDispersal events, although rare, may be facilitated by environmental events such as prevailing onshore winds or occasional flow of rainwater to the coast. We conclude that the high genetic diversity we observed is the result of ancient springtail lineages, patchy distribution of suitable habitats, and limited dispersal (gene flow) among habitable locations.",2019,9,10.1002/ece3.5103

However, little is known about how cosmopolitan or rare taxa combine to constitute communities and whether environmental variations promote changes in their relative abundances. Here we identified the Spatial Abundance Distribution (SpAD) of individual prokaryotic taxa (16S rDNA-defined Operational Taxonomic Units, OTUs) across 108 globally-distributed surface ocean stations. We grouped taxa based on their SpAD shape (normal-like- abundant and ubiquitous; logistic- globally rare, present in few sites; and bimodal- abundant only in certain oceanic regions), and investigated how the abundance of these three categories relates to environmental gradients. Most surface assemblages were numerically dominated by a few cosmopolitan normal-like OTUs, yet there was a gradual shift towards assemblages dominated by logistic taxa in specific areas with productivity and temperature differing the most from the average conditions in the sampled stations. When we performed the SpAD categorization including additional habitats (deeper layers and particles of varying sizes), the SpAD of many OTUs changed towards fewer normal-like shapes, and OTUs categorized as globally rare in the surface ocean became abundant. This suggests that understanding the mechanisms behind microbial rarity and dominance requires expanding the context of study beyond local communities and single habitats. We show that marine bacterial communities comprise taxa displaying a continuum of SpADs, and that variations in their abundances can be linked to habitat transitions or barriers that delimit the distribution of community members.",2019,28,10.1111/mec.15026

Yet, we still lack information on which farming practices can effectively shape the soil microbial communities. The aim of this study was to identify the farming practices, which are most effective at positively or negatively modifying bacterial and fungal diversity while considering the soil environmental variation at a landscape scale. A long-term research study catchment (12 km(2)) representative of intensive mixed farming (livestock and crop) in Western Europe was investigated using a regular grid for soil sampling (n = 186). Farming systems on this landscape scale were described in terms of crop rotation, use of fertilizer, soil tillage, pesticides treatments, and liming. Molecular microbial biomass was estimated by soil DNA recovery. Bacterial and fungal communities were analyzed by 16S and 18S rRNA gene pyrosequencing. Microbial biomass was significantly stimulated by the presence of pasture during the crop rotation since temporary and permanent pastures, as compared to annual crops, increased the soil microbial biomass by �% and �% respectively. While soil properties (mainly pH) explained much of the variation in bacterial diversity, soil tillage seemed to be the most influential among the farming practices. A 2.4% increase in bacterial richness was observed along our gradient of soil tillage intensity. In contrast, farming practices were the predominant drivers of fungal diversity, which was mainly determined by the presence of pastures during the crop rotation. Compared to annual crops, temporary and permanent pastures increased soil fungal richness by �% and �.5%, respectively.

Microbes, primarily bacteria, are successful colonizers of extreme environments worldwide, yet in many instances, the interplay between harsh conditions, dispersal, and microbial biogeography remains unclear. This lack of clarity is particularly true for habitats where extreme temperature is not the overarching stressor, highlighting a need for studies that focus on the role other primary stressors (e.g., toxicants) play in shaping biogeographic patterns. In this study, we leveraged a naturally paired stream system in southern Mexico to explore how elevated hydrogen sulfide (H2S) influences microbial diversity. We sequenced a portion of the 16S rRNA gene using bacterial primers for water sampled from three geographically proximate pairings of streams with high (>20 mu M) or low (similar to 0 mu M) H2S concentrations. After exploring bacterial diversity within and among sites, we compared our results to a previous study of macroinvertebrates and fish for the same sites. By spanning multiple organismal groups, we were able to illuminate how H2S may differentially affect biodiversity. The presence of elevated H2S had no effect on overall bacterial diversity (p = 0.21), a large effect on community composition (25.8% of variation explained, p < 0.0001), and variable influence depending upon the group-whether fish, macroinvertebrates, or bacteriabeing considered. For bacterial diversity, we recovered nine abundant operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that comprised a core H2S-rich stream microbiome in the region. Many H2S-associated OTUs were members of the Epsilonproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria, which both have been implicated in endosymbiotic relationships between sulfur-oxidizing bacteria and eukaryotes, suggesting the potential for symbioses that remain to be discovered in these habitats.",2019,77,10.1007/s00248-018-1237-6

This approach often fails to demonstrate a consistent relationship between gene abundance and an ecosystem process rate. One reason this may occur is if a marker gene is not a good representative of a complete pathway. Here, we map the presence of 11 nitrogen (N)-cycling pathways in over 6000 complete bacterial and archaeal genomes using the Integrated Microbial Genomes database. Incomplete N-cycling pathways occurred in 39% of surveyed archaeal and bacterial species revealing a weakness in current marker-gene analyses.

The community composition of diatoms and that of total and active prokaryotes were different among the major ocean zones investigated. We found significant relationships between compositional changes of diatoms and of prokaryotes. In contrast, spatial changes in the prokaryotic community composition were not related to geographic distance and to environmental parameters when the effect of diatoms was accounted for. Diatoms explained 30% of the variance in both the total and the active prokaryotic community composition in early spring in the Southern Ocean. Using co-occurrence analyses, we identified a large number of highly significant correlations between abundant diatom species and prokaryotic taxa. Our results show that key diatom species of the Southern Ocean are each associated with a distinct prokaryotic community, suggesting that diatom assemblages contribute to shaping the habitat type for heterotrophic prokaryotes.",2019,21,10.1111/1462-2920.14579

Evolutionary phenomena, such as cryptic speciation and modification due to the environment, hamper reliable conclusions about the distribution of this important plankton group. We combined newly collected samples from the Black Sea (ten new strains from three localities) with occurrence data, which have been gathered extensively over the past decade, in order to provide the first global distribution maps of four specific ribotypes assigned to the Scrippsiella lineage (Thoracosphaeraceae, Peridiniales) collected at a total of 39 sites. They showed a wide, partly overlapping distribution and shared the presence primarily at the coastal localities. Differences in abundance of specific ribotypes were observed, but the ribotype corresponding to the globally most frequently encountered species Scrippsiella acuminata has not yet been found in the Black Sea. We discuss the significance of DNA-based records for distribution maps particularly of unicellular organisms such as dinophytes. Based on a collective approach as exemplified in our study, we may start to understand in detail the ecological basis and the dynamics of the individual colonisation/invasion events, species establishment and consequent distribution in the microbiome, all of which have been changing drastically due to the ongoing climate change.",2019,49,10.1007/s12526-018-0848-y

This paper describes Sinelobus stromatoliticus sp. nov., a tanaidacean living within laminated stromatolites along the South African coastline. S. stromatoliticus is the sixth geographically isolated species now recognised within what was once considered to be a single globally cosmopolitan species, S. stanfordiRichardson, 1901. A revised, sex-specific dichotomous key to all the species currently recognised within this genus is provided. Sinelobus stromatoliticus is a prominent and abundant metazoan within the living stromatolite habitats, yet despite being a burrowing and grazing species, stromatolite layering is not hampered by its presence. Future work should determine the relationship between other populations (cf. S. stanfordi) in South Africa (previously identified as Tanais philetaerus Stebbing, 1904) and those of the stromatolite-dwelling S. stromatoliticus.

Metarhizium and Beauveria species were isolated in diverse ecoregions within the study area, but a trend for increased isolation of Metarhizium species in western regions of the study area was observed. Consistent with this observation, the prevalence of M. brunneum and M. robertsii decreased at higher elevations, and the opposite was true for Beauveria. Both M. brutmeum and M. robertsii were more commonly isolated from agricultural and natural habitat subsites, and considerable genotypic diversity was observed in both habitats and within the same subsite. Metarhizium robertsii, but not M. brunneum, was more commonly isolated from nonglaciated locations; however, less diversity and richness was observed for M. brunneum recovered from glaciated versus nonglaciated locations consistent with insular biogeography.

We tested whether and to what degree a range of different fungal diversity estimates are subject to latitudinal constraints and compared co-occurrence patterns of plants and soil fungi. We found that alpha diversity of plants increased towards lower latitude, while that of soil fungi only tended to increase. Abiotic but not biotic factors controlled fungal alpha diversity. Multiple-site and pairwise beta diversity of soil fungi were closely linked to plant communities. Null model revealed an increasing interaction strength between plant species, while there was a hump-shaped pattern of interaction strength between fungal species from high-latitude towards low-latitude.

Although biocontrol agents (BCAs) have been used extensively for controlling plant diseases, the ecological effects of BCAs on phyllosphere bacteria and the relationships between phyllosphere community and plant health are poorly understood. In this study, we explored the control efficiency of two BCA communities on bacterial wildfire disease by repeatedly spraying BCAs on tobacco leaves. The results of field tests showed that BCAs used in our study, especially BCA_B, had remarkable control effects against tobacco wildfire disease. The higher control efficiency of BCA_B might be attributed to a highly diverse and complex community in the phyllosphere. By 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing, we found that phyllosphere microbial community, including community diversity, taxonomic composition and microbial interactions, changed significantly by application of BCAs. According to the correlation analysis, it showed that wildfire disease infection of plants was negatively related to phyllosphere microbial diversity, indicating a highly diverse community in the phyllosphere might prevent pathogens invasion and colonization. In addition, we inferred that a more complex network in the phyllosphere might be beneficial for decreasing the chances of bacterial wildfire outbreak, and the genera of Pantoea and Sphingomonas might play important roles in wildfire disease suppression. These correlations between phyllosphere community and plant health will improve our understanding on the ecological function of phyllosphere community on plants.",2019,9,10.1186/s13568-019-0765-x

However, as the intensity of scientific investigation has increased, so these views have started to change. In particular, the role and impact of human activity toward indigenous microbial communities has started to come under more intense scrutiny. During the Subglacial Lake Ellsworth exploration campaign in December 2012, a microbiological survey was conducted to determine the extent and likelihood of exogenous input into the subglacial lake system during the hot-water drilling process. Snow was collected from the surface to represent that used for melt water production for hot-water drilling. The results of this study showed that snow used to provide melt water differed in its microbiological composition from that of the surrounding area and raised the question of how the biogeography of snow-borne microorganisms might influence the potential outcome of scientific analyses. In this study, we investigated the biogeography of microorganisms in snow around a series of Antarctic logistic hubs, where human activity was clearly apparent, and from which scientific investigations have been undertaken. A change in microbial community structure with geographical location was apparent and, notably, a decrease in alpha diversity at more remote southern latitudes. Soil-related microorganisms dominated microbial assemblages suggesting terrestrial input, most likely from long-range aeolian transport into continental Antarctica. We also observed that relic DNA was not a major issue when assessing snow samples. Overall, our observations might have profound implications for future scientific activities in Antarctica, such as the need to establish no-go protected areas, the need for better characterization of field sites and improved protocols for sterilization and verification of ice drilling equipment.",2019,10,10.3389/fmicb.2019.00461

In the current study, we used next-generation sequencing to characterize the differences in soil bacterial communities in five offshore subtropical granite islands (Matsu Islets, MI) of mainland China and two offshore tropical andesite islands (Orchid [OI] and Green Islands [GI]) of Taiwan. The soils of OI and GI were more acidic and had higher organic carbon and total nitrogen content than MI soils. The bacterial communities were dominated by Acidobacteria and Proteobacteria but had different relative abundance because soils were derived from different parent material and because of geographic distance. Non-metric multi-dimensional scaling revealed that the communities formed different clusters among different parent material and geographically distributed soils. The alpha-diversity in bacterial communities was higher in tropical than subtropical soils. Mantel test and redundancy analysis indicated that bacterial diversity and compositions of OI and GI soils, respectively, were positively correlated with soil pH, organic carbon, total nitrogen, microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen. These results suggest that variations in soil properties of offshore islands could result from differences in soil parent material. Distinct soils derived from different parent material and geographic distance could in turn alter the bacterial communities.",2019,9,10.1038/s41598-019-41170-9

Little information is available about the impacts of the invasion chronosequence of Spartina alterniflora on the dynamics of soil microbial community. Soil microbial community in coastal salt marshes invaded by S. alterniflora and reference wetlands covered by Suaeda salsa were investigated using phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) profiling along a short-term chronosequence (i.e., 2-, 5- and 10-year) of S. alterniflora invasion in the Yellow River Estuary. Results exhibited an increase in soil moisture, soil organic matter (SOM), soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total nitrogen (TN) and the total of PLFAs with increasing invasion ages of S. alterntflora in these coastal salt marshes. Comparatively, soil pH and bulk density exhibited a weak decline along the invasion chronosequence. The elevated values of relative abundance of fungi and the ratios of fungi: bacteria (F/B) in all invaded salt marshes were mainly associated with the accumulation of soil available substrate (e.g., SOM, DOC and TN). S. alterniflora invasion also increased the ratios of gram-positive/gram-negative (G�) bacterial PLFAs, with the highest value occurring in the 2-year invaded salt marshes. The bacterial stress indicated by ratios of cy17:0/16:1 omega 7c and cy19:0/18:1 omega 7c consistently decreased along the invasion chronosequence. In conclusion, the shifts of soil microbial community composition were tightly associated with soil variables, such as soil pH and soil nutrient supply. Our findings reflect the short-term chronological effects of S. alterniflora invasion on the soil physicochemical characteristics and microbial communities, which contributes to the linkage between the plant invasion and soil development of coastal salt marshes.

Here, we demonstrate that, although in low relative abundance (i.e., fungal reads made up 1.4-2.9% of the metagenomes), fungi contribute to both phylogenetic and functional microbial diversity with a conserved fungal presence in global marine samples. Universally distributed taxa and functions implicate them in complex carbon and fatty acid metabolism, with depth stratification along pelagic zones. Functional differences in observed genes between epipelagic and mesopelagic waters indicate changes in UV protection, shift to carbohydrate limited diets, as well as alternative energy sources. Metagenomic data also provided evidence for a latitudinal gradient in fungal diversity linked to temperature shifts.

Surprisingly little is known about the processes that govern how environmental microbes assemble on plants in nature. In this study we examine how bacteria are distributed across plant parts, and how these distributions interact with spatial gradients. We sequenced amplicons of bacteria from the surfaces of six plant parts and adjacent soil of Scaevola taccada, a common beach shrub, along a 60 km transect spanning Oahu islands windward coast, as well as within a single intensively-sampled site. Bacteria are more strongly partitioned by plant part as compared with location. Within S. taccada plants, microbial communities are highly nested: soil and rhizosphere communities contain much of the diversity found elsewhere, whereas reproductive parts fall at the bottom of the nestedness hierarchy. Nestedness patterns suggest either that microbes follow a source/sink gradient from the ground up, or else that assembly processes correlate with other traits, such as tissue persistence, that are vertically stratified.

Canonical correlation analysis analysis indicated correlation between the distance of the lake from urbanized population and bacterial diversity in Donje Bare Lake sediment. Bacterial diversity of Black Lake sediment was correlated with high content of phosphorous and pH value. Chemical compounds exhibiting the most prominent correlation with bacterial diversity of Plav Lake were NH4-N, K2O, CaCo3, and total nitrogen . Additionally, CCA analysis indicated that population density was correlated with biodiversity of bacterial communities in Plav Lake sediment, which is the most exposed to human population.

These communities may also differ from one other as a result of geographical isolation. Here we compare microbial community composition in surficial sediments of two hadal environments-the Mariana and Kermadec trenches-to evaluate microbial biogeography at hadal depths. Sediment microbial consortia were distinct between trenches, with higher relative sequence abundances of taxa previously correlated with organic matter degradation present in the Kermadec Trench. In contrast, the Mariana Trench, and deeper sediments in both trenches, were enriched in taxa predicted to break down recalcitrant material and contained other uncharacterized lineages. At the 97% similarity level, sequence-abundant taxa were not trench-specific and were related to those found in other hadal and abyssal habitats, indicating potential connectivity between geographically isolated sediments. Despite the diversity of microorganisms identified using culture-independent techniques, most isolates obtained under in situ pressures were related to previously identified piezophiles. Members related to these same taxa also became dominant community members when native sediments were incubated under static, long-term, unamended high-pressure conditions. Our results support the hypothesis that there is connectivity between sediment microbial populations inhabiting the Mariana and Kermadec trenches while showing that both whole communities and specific microbial lineages vary between trench of collection and sediment horizon depth. This in situ biodiversity is largely missed when incubating samples within pressure vessels and highlights the need for revised protocols for high-pressure incubations.",2019,10,10.3389/fmicb.2019.00347

However, studying species interactions belowground has unique challenges relative to the aboveground realm. The structure of the media and spatial scale are among the key aspects that seem to strongly influence belowground interactions. As a consequence, our understanding of species interactions belowground is limited, at least compared to what is known about interactions aboveground. Here we address the general question: Do the ecological concepts that have been developed largely in aboveground systems apply to understanding species interactions in the rhizosphere? We first explore to what extent ecological concepts related to species interactions are considered in rhizosphere studies across various subdisciplines. Next, we explore differences and similarities above-and belowground for fundamental concepts in ecology, choosing topics that are underrepresented in rhizosphere studies but represent a swath of concepts: species diversity, island biogeography, self-organization and ecosystem engineering, trophic cascades, and chemical communication. Finally, we highlight to overcome major challenges of current methodologies to study rhizosphere interactions in order to advance the understanding of belowground interactions in an ecological context. By synthesizing literature related to rhizosphere interactions, we reveal similarities, as well as key differences, in how fundamental ecological concepts are used and tested in above-and belowground studies.

Plants that form obligate symbiotic associations with microbes dominate island ecosystems, but the relationship between island inhabitance and symbiotic specificity is unclear, especially in the tropics. To fill this gap, we examined the mycorrhizal specificity of the Hawaiian endemic orchid Anoectochilus sandvicensis across multiple populations encompassing its entire geographic distribution. Methods By molecular phylogenetic approaches we identified the mycorrhizal fungi associated with A. sandvicensis across its entire geographic distribution and determined the relationship of these fungi to others found elsewhere around the globe. With richness estimators, we assessed the mycorrhizal specificity of A. sandvicensis within and among islands. We then tested whether geographic proximity of orchid populations was a significant predictor for the presence of particular mycorrhizal fungi and their community composition. Key Results We found that each population of A. sandvicensis forms specific associations with one of three fungi in the genus Ceratobasidium and that the closest relatives of these fungi are globally widespread. Based on diversity indices, A. sandvicensis populations were estimated to partner with one to four mycorrhizal taxa with an estimated total of four compatible mycorrhizal fungi across its entire distribution. However, the geographic proximity of orchid populations was not a significant predictor of mycorrhizal fungal community composition. Conclusions Our findings indicate that the colonization and survival of plant species on even the most remote oceanic islands is not restricted to symbiotic generalists, and that partnering with few, but cosmopolitan microbial symbionts is an alternative means for successful island establishment. We suggest that the spatial distribution and abundance of symbionts in addition to island age, size and isolation should also be taken into consideration for predictions of island biodiversity.",2019,123,10.1093/aob/mcy198

However, variations in core and non-core bacterial community structure, as well as the relationships between these communities and water chemistry or geographic distance have not been well studied. Here, we sampled in the entire course of the Lean River, China, and explored the bacterial community composition at each site using Illumina high-throughput sequencing. The proportion of sequence reads assigned to the core community was similar to 95% in the upper and middle reaches, gradually decreasing below 90% in the lower reaches. Both the Chao1 richness index and the Shannon diversity index of the bacterial communities were significantly higher in the wet season than in the dry season, and both indices increased slightly from upstream to downstream. The variation in the non-core community was more aggregated from upstream to downstream in the wet season than in the dry season, while the aggregation of the core community was similar between the dry season and the wet season. The proportion of typical freshwater bacterial was significantly higher in the core community than in the non-core community. NO3--N was the subset of water chemistry parameters that best explained bacterial community dissimilarities, while river length was the subset of geographic distance parameters that best explained bacterial community dissimilarities. Water chemistry parameters explained more of the variations in the bacterial communities than did geographic distance, especially in the dry season. However, the correlation betweenwater chemistry and bacteriawas primarily due to collective allochthonous input (mass effects), not because of any nutritious or toxic effects on bacterial growth competition (species sorting). The greater influence of the mass effects, as compared to species sorting, on bacterial community structure was due to the allochthonous input of bacteria from anthropogenic sources.

Transmission typically occurs indirectly via environmental exposure, with devastating consequences for human and animal health, as well as pastoralist economies. India has a high annual occurrence of anthrax in some regions, but a country-wide delineation of risk has not yet been undertaken. The current study modelled the geographical suitability of anthrax across India and its associated environmental features using a biogeographic application of machine learning. Both biotic and abiotic features contributed to risk across multiple scales of influence. The elephant-livestock interface was the dominant feature in delineating anthrax suitability. In addition, water-soil balance, soil chemistry and historical forest loss were also influential. These findings suggest that the elephant-livestock interface plays an important role in the cycling of anthrax in India.

Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that the donor oral microbiota clustered with those of the HOMA mice and were distinct from those of specific pathogen-free (SPF) mice. In HOMA mice, OTU counts decreased from the stomach and small intestine to the distal gut. The distal gut was dominated by Streptococcus, Veillonella, Haemophilus, Fusobacterium, Trichococcus and Actinomyces. HOMA mice and human microbiota-associated (HMA) mice along with the GF mice were then cohoused. Microbial communities of cohoused mice clustered together and were significantly separated from those of HOMA mice and HMA mice. The Source Tracker analysis and network analysis revealed more significant ecological invasion from oral bacteria in the small intestines, compared to the distal gut, of cohoused mice. In conclusion, a HOMA mouse model was successfully established. By overcoming the physical and microbial barrier, oral bacteria colonised the gut and profiled the gut microbiota, especially in the small intestine.",2019,11,10.1038/s41368-018-0043-9

Here, we collected 251 soil samples from adjacent pairs of maize and rice fields at a continental scale in eastern China. We revealed the major ecological roles of the core microbiota in maintaining complex connections between bacterial taxa and their associations with belowground multinutrient cycling. By identifying the habitat preferences of the core microbiota, we built a continental atlas for mapping the spatial distributions of bacteria in agro-soils, which helps forecast the responses of agricultural ecosystems to anthropogenic disturbance. The multinutrient cycling index for maize and rice soils was related to bacterial alpha-diversity and beta-diversity, respectively. Rice soils exhibited higher bacterial diversity and closer bacterial cooccurrence relationships than maize soils. In contrast to the macro- or microecological latitudinal richness patterns in natural terrestrial ecosystems, the bacteria in maize soils showed higher richness at high latitudes; however, this trend was not observed in rice soils. This study provides a new perspective on the distinct bacterial biogeographic patterns to predict the ecological roles of the core microbiota in agro-soils and thus helps manage soil bacterial communities for better provisioning of key ecosystem services. IMPORTANCE Disentangling the roles of the core microbiota in community maintaining and soil nutrient cycling is an important yet poorly understood topic in microbial ecology. This study presents an exploratory effort to gain predictive understanding of the spatial atlas and ecological roles of the core microbiota. A systematic, continental-scale survey was conducted using agro-soils in adjacent pairs of maize (dryland) and rice (wetland) fields across eastern China. The results indicate that the core microbiota play major ecological roles in maintaining complex connections between bacterial taxa and are associated with belowground multinutrient cycling. A continental atlas was built for mapping the bacterial spatial distributions in agro-soils through identifying their habitat preferences. This study represents a significant advance in forecasting the responses of agricultural ecosystems to anthropogenic disturbance and thus helps manage soil bacterial communities for better provisioning of key ecosystem services-the ultimate goal of microbial ecology.",2019,4,10.1128/mSystems.00313-18

Norikura,FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY,"There is considerable interest in the factors which may explain variation in microbial community assembly processes. In this study, we investigated bacterial community assembly, phylogenetic diversity and the relative role of deterministic and stochastic processes along environmental gradients on Mt. Norikura, Japan. DNA extracted from soil samples collected at a range of elevations was PCR-amplified targeting the V3 and V4 regions of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, and sequenced using Illumina MiSeq. We hypothesized that elevation would be a strong predictor of phylogenetic community assembly, with communities being more phylogenetically clustered towards higher elevations, due to more extreme physiological conditions. We also hypothesized a greater role of stochasticity at the highest elevations, due to more frequent soil disturbance. Contrary to our hypotheses, we found that the strength of phylogenetic clustering and the role of stochasticity were strongly related to soil pH, with phylogenetic clustering and deterministic processes being strongest at lower soil pH values. Moreover, there was no trend towards stronger influence of phylogenetic clustering and stochasticity in the upper elevations of Mt. Norikura. These results reveal an overwhelming influence of soil pH on phylogenetic community assembly of soil bacteria, even when a range of other environmental gradients are present.",2019,95,10.1093/femsec/fiy216
"Vlok, M; Lang, AS; Suttle, CA",Marine RNA Virus Quasispecies Are Distributed throughout the Oceans,MSPHERE,"RNA viruses, particularly genetically diverse members of the Picornavirales, are widespread and abundant in the ocean. Gene surveys suggest that there are spatial and temporal patterns in the composition of RNA virus assemblages, but data on their diversity and genetic variability in different oceanographic settings are limited. Here, we show that specific RNA virus genomes have widespread geographic distributions and that the dominant genotypes are under purifying selection. Genomes from three previously unknown picorna-like viruses (BC-1, -2, and -3) assembled from a coastal site in British Columbia, Canada, as well as marine RNA viruses JP-A, JP-B, and Heterosigma akashiwo RNA virus exhibited different biogeographical patterns. Thus, biotic factors such as host specificity and viral life cycle, and not just abiotic processes such as dispersal, affect marine RNA virus distribution. Sequence differences relative to reference genomes imply that virus quasispecies are under purifying selection, with synonymous single-nucleotide variations dominating in genomes from geographically distinct regions resulting in conservation of amino acid sequences. Conversely, sequences from coastal South Africa that mapped to marine RNA virus JP-A exhibited more nonsynonymous mutations, probably representing amino acid changes that accumulated over a longer separation. This biogeographical analysis of marine RNA viruses demonstrates that purifying selection is occurring across oceanographic provinces. These data add to the spectrum of known marine RNA virus genomes, show the importance of dispersal and purifying selection for these viruses, and indicate that closely related RNA viruses are pathogens of eukaryotic microbes across oceans. IMPORTANCE Very little is known about aquatic RNA virus populations and genome evolution. This is the first study that analyzes marine environmental RNA viral assemblages in an evolutionary and broad geographical context. This study contributes the largest marine RNA virus metagenomic data set to date, substantially increasing the sequencing space for RNA viruses and also providing a baseline for comparisons of marine RNA virus diversity. The new viruses discovered in this study are representative of the most abundant family of marine RNA viruses, the Marnaviridae, and expand our view of the diversity of this important group. Overall, our data and analyses provide a foundation for interpreting marine RNA virus diversity and evolution.",2019,4,10.1128/mSphereDirect.00157-19

Such activities pose significant long-term disturbances and potentially severe impacts to both ecosystem structure and functioning, as well as associated ecosystem services. The Rio Grande Rise presents a severely understudied area, with very little knowledge on either local and regional scales. Most detailed knowledge available is centered on highly localised geological information and interpolated and/or modelled environmental data, while high-resolution data on biogeography, ecosystem processes and functioning are lacking. The Rio Grande Rise is most likely a remnant of the Parana-Etendeka igneous province, and formed when the African and South-American plates separated to form the Southern Atlantic basin, about 75 million years ago. More recent cruises have generated very local and high-resolution acoustic impedance data on the substrate, showing extremely dense layers, likely to be cobalt-rich crusts and underlying bedrock, interspersed with thick sediment layers. Literature studies revealed that nowadays the Rise appears to be located within a relatively low-productivity oceanic region. Open-database mining yielded large-scale, extrapolated environmental data rasters, which show the Rise to be an oceanic region relatively free of pollution and anthropogenic disturbances, with high geomorphological heterogeneity and potential for high biodiversity. This image was confirmed in a small number of scientific submarine cruises, where a diverse range of seascapes was observed, from soft sediment to carbonate pavement and cobalt crust outcrops. Especially the latter substrata were found to be inhabited by diverse benthic communities, dominated by sessile organisms, presenting three-dimensional structural heterogeneity and with associated vertebrate and invertebrate animals. Cobalt-rich crusts appear to grow at an extremely slow rate of several mm per million years, in the deep ocean where biological and ecological processes such as reproduction, growth and recolonisation are characterised by slow dynamics. The main disturbances posed by deep-sea mining of cobalt-rich crusts on the Rio Grande Rise consist of (1) complete removal of substrate with its particular benthic communities, (2) strong localised increases in suspended particulate matter, causing smothering of breathing apparatus and dilution of food particles, (3) crushing by tailings and overburden and (4) toxicity effects by released metals and other toxic substances, likely to be increased under high pressure. These impacts will likely change the deep-sea ecosystem at the Rio Grande Rise and its functioning for time scales in the order of decades to centuries. State-of-the-art geological, environmental and ecological modelling, complemented with high-quality, fine-resolution data are needed to provide a detailed evaluation of the impacts of cobalt-rich ferromanganese crust mining in the Rio Grande Rise, with the goal to formulate strategic environmental management plans.",2019,145,10.1016/j.dsr.2018.12.007
"Nasko, DJ; Ferrell, BD; Moore, RM; Bhavsar, JD; Polson, SW; Wommack, KE",CRISPR Spacers Indicate Preferential Matching of Specific Virioplankton Genes,MBIO,"Viral infection exerts selection pressure on marine microbes, as virus-induced cell lysis causes 20 to 50% of cell mortality, resulting in fluxes of bio-mass into oceanic dissolved organic matter. Archaeal and bacterial populations can defend against viral infection using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-associated (Cas) system, which relies on specific matching between a spacer sequence and a viral gene. If a CRISPR spacer match to any gene within a viral genome is equally effective in preventing lysis, no viral genes should be preferentially matched by CRISPR spacers. However, if there are differences in effectiveness, certain viral genes may demonstrate a greater frequency of CRISPR spacer matches. Indeed, homology search analyses of bacterioplankton CRISPR spacer sequences against virioplankton sequences revealed preferential matching of replication proteins, nucleic acid binding proteins, and viral structural proteins. Positive selection pressure for effective viral defense is one parsimonious explanation for these observations. CRISPR spacers from virioplankton metagenomes preferentially matched methyltransferase and phage integrase genes within virioplankton sequences. These virioplankton CRISPR spacers may assist infected host cells in defending against competing phage. Analyses also revealed that half of the spacer-matched viral genes were unknown, some genes matched several spacers, and some spacers matched multiple genes, a many-tomany relationship. Thus, CRISPR spacer matching may be an evolutionary algorithm, agnostically identifying those genes under stringent selection pressure for sustaining viral infection and lysis. Investigating this subset of viral genes could reveal those genetic mechanisms essential to virus-host interactions and provide new technologies for optimizing CRISPR defense in beneficial microbes. IMPORTANCE The CRISPR-Cas system is one means by which bacterial and archaeal populations defend against viral infection which causes 20 to 50% of cell mortality in the ocean. We tested the hypothesis that certain viral genes are preferentially targeted for the initial attack of the CRISPR-Cas system on a viral genome. Using CASC, a pipeline for CRISPR spacer discovery, and metagenome data from oceanic microbes and viruses, we found a clear subset of viral genes with high match frequencies to CRISPR spacers. Moreover, we observed a many-to-many relationship of spacers and viral genes. These high-match viral genes were involved in nucleotide metabolism, DNA methylation, and viral structure. It is possible that CRISPR spacer matching is an evolutionary algorithm pointing to those viral genes most important to sustaining infection and lysis. Studying these genes may advance the understanding of virus-host interactions in nature and provide new technologies for leveraging CRISPR-Cas systems in beneficial microbes.",2019,10,10.1128/mBio.02651-18

Interactions between surface water and shallow, subsurface groundwater produce the oxygen and nutrient gradients that influence these microbially mediated biogeochemical functions. Microbial nutrient processing is often limited by nutrient availability, but we lack a clear understanding of the relationships between hydrology, water chemistry, microbial composition, and nutrient cycling. In this study we evaluated the prediction that the microbial (bacterial and archaeal) assemblage composition in surface and subsurface water (both within and among stream reaches) would be related to dissolved nutrient concentrations, surface-subsurface hydrologic connectivity, and reach-scale N cycling rates. To evaluate our predictions, we collected data on water chemistry, whole-stream hydrological connectivity, biogeochemical function, and surface and subsurface water microbial assemblage composition at 6 streams in the southwestern USA. We found no correlation between microbial assemblage composition and stream nutrient concentrations or cycling rates, but observed that subsurface waters in some streams had higher taxonomic richness than surface waters. Instead, differences in microbial assemblage composition among the study streams were correlated with both watershed size and stream water Br- concentrations. These results suggest that the longer, deeper groundwater flowpaths in larger watersheds, which promote solute accumulation, influence streamwater microbial assemblage composition. These contrasting streamwater microbial assemblages were associated with different reach-scale sinks for N immobilization (fine benthic organic matter versus filamentous algae). Overall, results suggest that the catchment-scale history of water movement, and salinity, may affect both microbial diversity and the fate of N. The mechanisms by which stream microbial diversity influences ecosystem function require more attention. In particular, we need a better understanding of how microbial biogeography is influenced by the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of stream ecosystems.",2019,38,10.1086/701597

Results: With a thickness of more than 30 m, massive microbial boundstone is surrounded by thick-bedded oncoid-intraclast rudstone/grainstone. The reefs were constructed of cylindrical stromatolites and maze-like thrombolites, accompanying a small proportion of lithistid sponges (anthaspidellids) and hypercalcified sponges (Calathium). The earliest Floian age is based on a conodont fauna including the zonal index species Serratognathus bilobatus. Conclusions: The microbialites might have grown in shallow subtidal environments, indicated by the high aspect ratio of the stromatolites and the associated coarse-grained sediments. The initial growth of stromatolites was sufficient to inhibit hydrodynamic removal of sediment and to create microhabitats in which environmental conditions were favourable for later accretion of thrombolites and colonization by anthaspidellids and calathids. These sponge-bearing microbialites represent the initial rise of metazoans in reefs at the dawn of the Ordovician Radiation, providing crucial information for understanding the transition from microbial- to metazoan-dominant reefs during this unique interval.

In particular, very little is known about the speciation mechanisms which may give rise to the diversity of microscopic eukaryotes. It was postulated that the enormous population sizes and ubiquitous distribution of these organisms could lead to a lack of population differentiation and therefore very low speciation rates. However, such assumptions have traditionally been based on morphospecies, which may not accurately reflect the true diversity, missing cryptic taxa. In this study, we aim to articulate the major diversification mechanisms leading to the contemporary molecular diversity by using a colonial freshwater flagellate, Synura sphagnicola, as an example. Phylogenetic analysis of five sequenced loci showed that S. sphagnicola differentiated into two morphologically distinct lineages approximately 15.4 million years ago, which further diverged into several evolutionarily recent haplotypes during the late Pleistocene. The most recent haplotypes are ecologically and biogeographically much more differentiated than the old lineages, presumably because of their persistent differentiation after the allopatric speciation events. Our study shows that in microbial eukaryotes, species diversification via the colonization of new geographical regions or ecological resources occurs much more readily than was previously thought. Consequently, divergence times of microorganisms in some lineages may be equivalent to the estimated times of speciation in plants and animals.",2019,28,10.1111/mec.15011

In this study, we used an extended ancestral-state reconstruction algorithm to predict the functional capabilities of the rat gastrointestinal microbiome. Our results indicate an apparent tendency toward metabolic heterogeneity along the longitudinal and transverse axes of the rat gastrointestinal tract (GIT). This heterogeneity was suggested by the enriched small-molecule transport activity and amino acid metabolism in the upper GIT, the aerobic energy metabolism in the stomach and the mucolysis-related metabolism in the lower GIT mucus layer. In contrast to prior results, many functional overlaps were observed when the gastrointestinal microbiomes of different hosts were compared. These overlaps implied that although both the biogeographic location and host genotype were prominent driving forces in shaping the gastrointestinal microbiota, the microbiome functions were similar across hosts when observed under similar physicochemical conditions at identical anatomical sites. Our work effectively complements the rat microbial biogeography dataset we released in 2017 and, thus, contributes to a better understanding and prediction of disease-related alterations in microbial community function.",2019,20,10.3390/ijms20051232

We simultaneously examined the community compositions and structures of soil bacteria, fungi, and diazotrophs across desert, typical, and meadow steppes in Inner Mongolia using high-throughput sequencing. The results showed that soil bacteria, fungi, and diazotrophs exhibited different distribution patterns across steppe types. Although different steppes displayed obvious differences in climate conditions, plant traits, and soil properties, most of bacterial species were shared by all the steppes while only a few species were unique, indicating that the soil bacterial compositions were hardly influenced by the steppe types. Nevertheless, the habitat heterogeneity could cause shifts in the relative abundance of some bacterial groups, which resulted in significant changes in the community structure of soil bacteria across steppes. However, the fungal community compositions and structures were similar in typical and meadow steppes but that in desert steppe were significantly different. Whereas, the community compositions and structures of diazotrophs were strongly related to the steppe types. In this study, the similar parent material backgrounds of the steppe soils might be the important factor in shaping the homologous bacterial compositions. However, the variations in soil fertility, soil water repellency, and plant species across steppes would be the major driving forces in regulating the compositions and structures of fungal communities, while the diazotrophic communities would be more closely related to the changes in plant traits and soil fertility among steppes. Our results provided evidence of habitat specificity for different microbial groups and their underlying drivers.",2019,9,10.1002/ece3.4940

This knowledge gap strongly limits our ability to predict the effect of environmental filtering on microbial community structure and function. To improve the understanding of mechanisms underlying community assembly processes, we investigated bacterial community structure and function on a subalpine shady slope and a sunny slope in the Pangquangou National Nature Reserve in North China. By integrating the results of a null model and the RC metric, we inferred that a deterministic process, that is, environmental filtering, drove bacterial community biogeographical patterns. Edaphic factors caused the largest contribution to microbial community structure, followed by vegetation and spatial variables. Among edaphic factors, total carbon (TC) and total nitrogen (TN) were the most important factors as determined by redundancy analysis (RDA). Moreover, network analysis suggested that the status of bacterial community co-occurrence was significantly greater than that of exclusive relationships. Under environmental stress, there was no significant difference in the overall bacterial community structure on the different slopes, while significant differences were observed in relation to community functions. Given this, we inferred that the degrees of response of bacterial community structure and function to varying environments were not consistent. In conclusion, our results contribute to the understanding of deterministic versus stochastic balance in bacterial community assembly and the response mechanisms of community structure and function to environmental heterogeneity.",2019,59,10.1002/jobm.201800314

Identifying these mechanisms is significant for understanding how microbes have evolved to fill specific ecological niches within a host. Vibrio fischeri is a bioluminescent bacterium that colonizes and proliferates within the light organ of the Hawaiian bobtail squid, which provides an opportunity to study how bacteria grow in vivo. Here, the transcription factor CysB is shown to be necessary for V. fischeri both to grow on several sulfur sources in vitro and to establish symbiosis with juvenile squid. CysB is also found to regulate several genes involved in sulfate assimilation and to contribute to the growth of V. fischeri on cystine, which is the oxidized form of cysteine. A mutant that grows on cystine but not sulfate could establish symbiosis, suggesting that V. fischeri acquires nutrients related to this compound within the host. Finally, CysB-regulated genes are shown to be differentially expressed among the V. fischeri populations occupying the various colonization sites found within the light organ.

Here we report on a comprehensive analysis of the drivers of diversity distribution and composition of the ecologically and economically important Phytophthora genus from 414 soil samples collected across Australia. We assessed 22 environmental and seven categorical variables as potential predictors of Phytophthora species richness, alpha and beta diversity, including both phylogenetically and non-phylogenically explicit methods. In addition, we classified each species as putatively native or introduced and examined the distribution with respect to putative origin. The two most widespread species, P. multivora and P. cinnamomi, are introduced, though five of the ten most widely distributed species are putatively native. Introduced taxa comprised over 54% of Australias Phytophthora diversity and these species are known pathogens of annual and perennial crop habitats as well as urban landscapes and forestry.

Large-scale studies are lacking for soil animals, which control microbial communities and represent one of the most diverse yet poorly known animal assemblages. Here, we analyzed a major group (Oribatida) to test whether belowground macroecological patterns can be predicted by climatic variables, vegetation and large-scale variation in key soil properties. Location We modelled the multivariate distribution of more than 100 species using biodiversity data collected across Great Britain in the framework of the Countryside Survey (). Methods We analyzed species-level data from 582 samples collected across 162 hectads (10 x 10 km) covering the largest possible range of vegetation types, soil properties and climatic conditions within GB. We created the first large-scale maps of soil animal diversity metrics at the GB scale, including novel estimates of metrics of phylogenetic diversity (PD). Using structural equation modelling, we quantified the direct and indirect effects of location (latitude, longitude), plant community structure and abiotic factors such as precipitation on species composition, richness and PD. Results We found that variation in species composition follows a latitudinal gradient with diversity generally increasing northward. The latitudinal variation in species composition drives PD via changes in both species richness and phylogenetic distance between species. This gradient is mostly determined by latitudinal variation in precipitation and organic matter, which were very good predictors of species composition. Precipitation and organic matter were, however, relatively weak while statistically significant predictors of diversity metrics. Conclusions Past studies have emphasized the unpredictability of species distributions and variation in species composition in hyper diverse soil animal communities. However, past studies were conducted at small scales, where stochastic factors may weaken the signal of deterministic factors. Oribatid mites in our study show for the first time that the large scale latitudinal gradients in climate and organic matter predict not only variation in species composition but also taxonomic and PD of soil animal communities.",2019,46,10.1111/jbi.13501

Poseidoniales ord. nov.),ISME JOURNAL,"Marine Group II (MGII) archaea represent the most abundant planktonic archaeal group in ocean surface waters, but our understanding of the group has been limited by a lack of cultured representatives and few sequenced genomes. Here, we conducted a comparative phylogenomic analysis of 270 recently available MGII metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) to investigate their evolution and ecology. Based on a rank-normalised genome phylogeny, we propose that MGII is an order-level lineage for which we propose the name Candidatus Poseidoniales (after Gr. n. Poseidon, God of the sea), comprising the families Candidatus Poseidonaceae fam. nov. (formerly subgroup MGIIa) and Candidatus Thalassarch-aeaceae fam. nov. (formerly subgroup MGIIb). Within these families, 21 genera could be resolved, many of which had distinct biogeographic ranges and inferred nutrient preferences. Phylogenetic analyses of key metabolic functions suggest that the ancestor of Ca. Poseidoniales was a surface water-dwelling photoheterotroph that evolved to occupy multiple related ecological niches based primarily on spectral tuning of proteorhodopsin genes. Interestingly, this adaptation appears to involve an overwrite mechanism whereby an existing single copy of the proteorhodopsin gene is replaced by a horizontally transferred copy, which in many instances should allow an abrupt change in light absorption capacity. Phototrophy was lost entirely from five Ca. Poseidoniales genera coinciding with their adaptation to deeper aphotic waters. We also report the first instances of nitrate reductase in two genera acquired via horizontal gene transfer (HGT), which was a potential adaptation to oxygen limitation. Additional metabolic traits differentiating families and genera include flagellar-based adhesion, transporters, and sugar, amino acid, and peptide degradation. Our results suggest that HGT has shaped the evolution of Ca.

"Rath, KM; Fierer, N; Murphy, DV; Rousk, J",Linking bacterial community composition to soil salinity along environmental gradients,ISME JOURNAL,"Salinization is recognized as a threat to soil fertility worldwide. A challenge in understanding the effects of salinity on soil microbial communities is the fact that it can be difficult to disentangle the effects of salinity from those of other variables that may co-vary with salinity. Here we use a trait-based approach to identify direct effects of salinity on soil bacterial communities across two salinity gradients. Through dose-response relationships between salinity and bacterial growth, we quantified distributions of the trait salt tolerance within the communities. Community salt tolerance was closely correlated with soil salinity, indicating a strong filtering effect of salinity on the bacterial communities. Accompanying the increases in salt tolerance were consistent shifts in bacterial community composition. We identified specific bacterial taxa that increased in relative abundances with community salt tolerance, which could be used as bioindicators for high community salt tolerance. A strong filtering effect was also observed for pH across the gradients, with pH tolerance of bacterial communities correlated to soil pH. We propose phenotypic trait distributions aggregated at the community level as a useful approach to study the role of environmental factors as filters of microbial community composition.",2019,13,10.1038/s41396-018-0313-8

Vegetation type, spatial distance, and environmental variability represent the three main factors shaping the structure of Glomeromycotinan communities. We present here one of the most comprehensive reports on Glomeromycotinan community structure in forest ecosystems, covering five ecosystem types. We explored the extent to which the latitudinal gradient in Glomeromycotinan diversity is confounded by the respective latitudinal gradient of host plants and how Glomeromycotinan communities diverge with spatial distance and environmental variability. We show that latitudinal differences in Glomeromycotinan alpha- and beta-diversity are largely shaped by the zonation patterns of ecosystem types and that differences among Glomeromycotinan communities occurring in different ecosystems are considerably larger than those occurring within the same ecosystem type. In contrast, we could observe little to no differences in phylogenetic community structure across samples, irrespective of their origin. In conclusion, several community assembly rules for Glomeromycotina in the woody systems, such as phylogenetic relationships, differed from those in grassland systems. Synthesis. We provide strong evidence that the latitudinal gradient in Glomeromycotinan diversity in woody systems is mainly driven by latitudinal differences in forest habitat types. Further exploring the causes of these differences across habitat types would probably reveal underexplored facets of the ecology of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi.",2019,107,10.1111/1365-2745.13060

For microbes that are plant symbionts, community assembly processes can lead to either a positive or negative relationship between plant size or age and soil microbe diversity. Here, we evaluated the extent to which such relationships exist within a single legume species (Acacia acuminata) and their naturally occurring symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria (rhizobia). We quantified the diversity of rhizobia that associate with A. acuminata trees of variable size spanning a large environmental gradient in southwest Australia (72 trees in 24 sites spread across similar to 300,000 km(2)), using metabarcoding. We modelled rhizobia diversity using 16S exact genetic variants, in a binomial multivariate statistical framework that controlled for climate and local soil characteristics. We identified two major phylogenetic clades of rhizobia that associate with A. acuminata. Soil sampled at the base of larger Acacia trees contained a higher richness of rhizobia genetic variants. Each major clade responds differently to environmental factors (climate and soil characteristics), but the positive association between tree size and rhizobia genetic diversity was mainly driven by responses from one of the two clades. Overall tree size explained more variation than any other factor, resulting in a similar to 3-fold increase in total richness and clade diversity from the smallest to the largest trees. Synthesis. Previous studies have shown that plant host species is important in structuring microbial soil communities in the rhizosphere. Our results show that host size or age within a single plant species can also structure diversity of at least one group of soil microbes. A positive relationship between plant host size and rhizobia diversity suggests that hosts may modify the niche space of their surrounding soil (niche construction hypothesis) enabling a higher richness of microbial taxa. That different rhizobial groups responded differently to host size and other ecological factors suggests that rhizobia is not an ecologically uniform group, and that entirely neutral explanations for our results are unlikely. Host plants may be analogous to islands, where larger plant hosts may accumulate diversity over time, through migration opportunities.",2019,107,10.1111/1365-2745.13083

This new paradigm generates challenges for microbiology, ecology, and ecotoxicology. Dispersal of MP is concomitant with that of their associated microorganisms and their mobile genetic elements, including antibiotic resistance genes, islands of pathogenicity, and diverse metabolic pathways.

Understanding the microbial community structure and the key factors driving the assemblages of wetland soil microbiota are important to reveal the connections between microorganisms and functions of wetland ecosystems. In this study, soil bacterial community compositions and the factors shaping them were investigated in three groups of wetlands across China, including Tibet plateau wetlands (TW), inland wetlands (IW) and coastal wetlands (CW). Overall, Bacterial community structure and turnover showed distinct patterns in different groups. Bacterial phyla were mainly composed of Proteobacteria followed by Chloroflexi, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes in all groups of wetland samples. At genus level, random forest model showed that Coprothermobacter and Acetobacter were two most important genera explaining the differences among groups. The abundances of these genera were very low in IW relative to the other two groups. The alpha diversity of IW was significantly higher than those of TW and CW. The relative contribution of environmental factors was larger in the assemblages of bacterial communities in TW and CW than that in IW. The pH and conductivity were recognized as the most important measured environmental factors influencing bacterial community structure. Our results suggested that the bacterial communities of wetlands in different regions were shaped with different mechanisms. The communities in CW and TW regions owned lower alpha diversity and were more influenced by deterministic processes than those in IW.

In the current survey, we present a molecular analysis of 60 Cypriostomum strains, which for the first time allows for the study of intra- and interspecific relationships within that subgenus, as well as the assessment of the biogeography patterns of its morphospecies. Analysis of COI mtDNA variation revealed three main clades (separated from each other by approximately 130 nucleotide substitutions), each one with internal sub-clusters (differing by 30 to 70 substitutions - a similar range found between P. aurelia cryptic species and P. bursaria syngens). The first clade is represented exclusively by P. polycaryum; the second one includes only four strains identified as P. calkinsi. The third cluster seems to be paraphyletic, as it includes P. nephridiatum, P. woodruffi, and Eucandidatus P. hungarianum. Some strains, previously identified as P. calkinsi, had COI sequences identical or very similar to P. nephridiatum ones. Morphological reinvestigation of several such strains revealed common morphological features with P. nephridiatum.

However, the importance of historical factors in microbial biogeography is more debatable. Historical factors include past ecological and evolutionary circumstances that may have influenced present-day microbial diversity, such as dispersal and past environmental conditions. Diverse thermophilic sulfate-reducing Desulfotomaculum are present as dormant endospores in marine sediments worldwide where temperatures are too low to support their growth. Therefore, they are dispersed to here from elsewhere, presumably a hot, anoxic habitat. While dispersal through ocean currents must influence their distribution in cold marine sediments, it is not clear whether even earlier historical factors, related to the source habitat where these organisms were once active, also have an effect. We investigated whether these historical factors may have influenced the diversity and distribution of thermophilic endospores by comparing their diversity in 10 Arctic fjord surface sediments. Although community composition varied spatially, clear biogeographic patterns were only evident at a high level of taxonomic resolution (> 97% sequence similarity of the 16S rRNA gene) achieved with oligotyping. In particular, the diversity and distribution of oligotypes differed for the two most prominent OTUs (defined using a standard 97% similarity cutoff). One OTU was dominated by a single ubiquitous oligotype, while the other OTU consisted of ten more spatially localized oligotypes that decreased in compositional similarity with geographic distance. These patterns are consistent with differences in historical factors that occurred when and where the taxa were once active, prior to sporulation. Further, the influence of history on biogeographic patterns was only revealed by analyzing microdiversity within OTUs, suggesting that populations within standard OTU-level groupings do not necessarily share a common ecological and evolutionary history.",2019,10,10.3389/fmicb.2019.00245

On the Pacific coast of North America, two canopy-forming kelps with contrasting life histories co-occur; Macrocystis pyrifera, a perennial species, and Nereocystis luetkeana, an annual species. Kelp blade-associated microbes were sampled from 12 locations across a spatial gradient in Washington, United States, from the outer Pacific Coast to Puget Sound. Microbial communities were characterized using next-generation Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA genes. At higher taxonomic levels (bacterial phylum and class), canopy-forming kelps hosted remarkably similar microbial communities, but at the amplicon sequence variant level, microbial communities on M. pyrifera and N. luetkeana were host-specific and distinct from free-living bacteria in the surrounding seawater. Microbial communities associated with blades of each kelp species displayed significant geographic variation. The microbiome of N. luetkeana changed along the spatial gradient and was significantly correlated to salinity, with outer Pacific coast sites enriched in Bacteroidetes (family Saprospiraceae) and Gammaproteobacteria (Granulosicoccus sp.), and southern Puget Sound sites enriched in Alphaproteobacteria (family Hyphomonadaceae). We also examined microbial community development and succession on meristematic and apical N. luetkeana blade tissues throughout the summer growing season on Tatoosh Island, WA. Across all dates, microbial communities were less diverse on younger, meristematic blade tissue compared to the older, apical tissues. In addition, phylogenetic relatedness among microbial taxa increased from meristematic to apical blade tissues, suggesting that the addition of microbial taxa to the community was a non-random process that selected for certain phylogenetic groups of microbes. Microbial communities on older, apical tissues displayed significant temporal variation throughout the summer and microbial taxa that were differentially abundant over time displayed clear patterns of community succession. Overall, we report that host species identity, geographic location, and blade tissue age shape the microbial communities on canopy-forming kelps.",2019,10,10.3389/fmicb.2019.00346

While warming ceased at the turn of the millennium, significant increases in air temperature are expected later this century, with predicted positive effects on soil fungal diversity, plant growth and ecosystem productivity. Here, by sequencing 16S ribosomal RNA genes in 40 soils sampled from along a 1,650 km climatic gradient through the maritime Antarctic, we determine whether rising air temperatures might similarly influence the diversity of soil bacteria. Of 22 environmental factors, mean annual surface air temperature was the strongest and most consistent predictor of soil bacterial diversity. Significant, but weaker, associations between bacterial diversity and soil moisture content, C:N ratio, and Ca, Mg, PO43- and dissolved organic C concentrations were also detected.

From a few studies done in Africa, the known bradyrhizobia (i.e., Bradyrhizobium elkanii, B. yuanmingense) along with many novel Bradyrhizobium species are the most dominant in African soils.

We investigated the microbiome diversity scaling (changes) over space by analyzing the diversity-area relationship (DAR), which is an extension to classic SAR (species-area relationship) law in biogeography. We built DAR models for archaea and bacteria with 16S-rRNA sequencing datasets from 165 hot springs globally. From the DAR models, we sketch out the biogeographic maps of hot-spring microbiomes by constructing: (i) DAR profile- measuring the archaea or bacteria diversity scaling over space (areas); (ii) PDO (pair-wise diversity overlap or similarity) profile-estimating the PDO between two hot springs; (iii) MAD (maximal accrual diversity) profile-predicting the global MAD; (iv) LRD/LGD (ratio of local diversity to regional or global diversity) profile. We further investigated the differences between archaea and bacteria in their biogeographic maps. For example, the comparison of DAR-profile maps revealed that the archaea diversity is more heterogeneous (i.e., more diverse) or scaling faster than the bacterial diversity does in terms of species numbers (species richness), but is less heterogeneous (i.e., less diverse) or scaling slower than bacteria when the diversity (Hill numbers) were weighted in favor of more abundant dominant species. When the diversity is weighted equally in terms of species abundances, archaea, and bacteria are equally heterogeneous over space or scaling at the same rate.

In this study, the integrated effect of seasonal differences and spatial distribution on bacterial community structure and diversity were investigated at the regional scale. We conducted a comprehensive bacterial survey, with 451 samples of the Scotian Shelf sector of the Northwest Atlantic Ocean during spring and fall of 2014 and 2016, to analyze the effects of physicochemical gradients on bacterial community structure. Throughout the region, Pelagibacteraceae and Rhodobacteraceae were the most common in the free-living fraction, while Flavobacteriia and Deltaproteobacteria were more abundant in the particle-associated fraction. Overall, there was strong covariation of the microbial community diversity from the two size fractions. This relationship existed despite the statistically significant difference in community structure between the free-living and particle-associated size fractions. In both size fractions, distribution patterns of bacterial taxa, and species within taxa, displayed temporal and spatial preferences. Distinct bacterial assemblages specific to season and depth in the water column were identified. These distinct assemblages, consistent for both 2014 and 2016, suggested replicable patterns in microbial communities for spring and fall in this region. Over all sites, temperature and oxygen values were highly correlated with community similarity, and salinity and oxygen values were the most strongly positively- and negatively correlated with alpha diversity, respectively. However, the strengths of these correlations depended on the depth and season sampled. The bathymetry of the Scotian Shelf, the abrupt shelf break to the Scotian Slope and the major ocean currents dominating in the region led to the formation of distinct on-shelf and off-shelf bacterial communities both in spring and fall. The highest species richness was observed at the shelf break, where water masses from the two major currents meet.

The lack of coordinated efforts to gather data at representative temporal and spatial scales limits aerobiology to help understand large scale patterns of global microbial biodiversity and its causal relationships with the environmental context. This paper presents the sampling strategy and analytical protocols developed in order to integrate different fields of research such as microbiology, -omics biology, atmospheric chemistry, physics and meteorology to characterize atmospheric microbial life. These include control of chemical and microbial contaminations from sampling to analysis and identification of experimental procedures for characterizing airborne microbial biodiversity and its functioning from the atmospheric samples collected at remote sites from low cell density environments. We used high-volume sampling strategy to address both chemical and microbial composition of the atmosphere, because it can help overcome low aerosol and microbial cell concentrations. To account for contaminations, exposed and unexposed control filters were processed along with the samples. We present a method that allows for the extraction of chemical and biological data from the same quartz filters. We tested different sampling times, extraction kits and methods to optimize DNA yield from filters. Based on our results, we recommend supplementary sterilization steps to reduce filter contamination induced by handling and transport. These include manipulation under laminar flow hoods and UV sterilization. In terms of DNA extraction, we recommend a vortex step and a heating step to reduce binding to the quartz fibers of the filters. These steps have led to a 10-fold increase in DNA yield, allowing for downstream omics analysis of air samples.

Ecology offers theoretical frameworks and lexicons to study microbiomes. Yet some of the terms and concepts borrowed from ecology are being used discordantly by microbiome studies from their traditional definitions. Here we define some of the ecological terms and concepts as they are used in ecology and the study of microbiomes. Where applicable, we have provided the historical context of the terms, highlighted examples from microbiome studies, and considered the research methods involved. We divided these concepts into four sections: Biomes, Diversity, Symbiosis, and Succession. Biomes encompass the interactions within the biotic and abiotic features of an environment. This extends to the term microbiome, derived from biome, and includes an environment and all the microbes within it. Diversity encompasses patterns of species richness, abundance, and biogeography, all of which are important to understanding the distribution of microbiomes. Symbiosis emphasizes the relationships between organisms within a community. Symbioses are often misunderstood to be synonymous with mutualism. We discard that implication, in favor of a broader, more historically accurate definition which spans the continuum from parasitism to mutualism. Succession includes classical succession, alternative stable states, community assembly frameworks, and r/K-selection. Our hope is that as microbiome researchers continue to apply ecological terms, and as ecologists continue to gain interest in microbiomes, each will do so in a way that enables cross-talk between them.

To obtain mechanistic understanding of this variation, we investigated the dynamics of methanogenesis over the course of glucose degradation in fourteen paddy field soils and five wetland soils collected from different regions of China. The results revealed that the maximal rate (2-3 mM per day) and the total amount (25-30 mM) of CH4 produced were similar across soil samples. The lag phase of methanogenesis, however, differed substantially with the shortest lag phase of 4 days in a paddy soil from north China and the longest of 32 days in a soil from south China, and this difference reflected a general geographical trend among all soils tested. Nitrate was reduced completely within 4 days in all soils. The reduction of Fe(III) and sulfate was completed after 21 days and 29 days, respectively. The depletion time of Fe(III) and sulfate were positively correlated with the lag phase of methanogenesis. Competition for common substrates between methanogens and iron and sulfate reducers, however, does not explain this coincidence because a slow production of CH4 was detected at the very beginning. It appears that the geographical variations in methanogenesis and the reduction of ferric iron and sulfate are related to the variation in soil pH but not to temperature, soil organic C and nutrient conditions in paddy and wetland soils across eastern China.

Most analyses of coastal microbial communities focus on the characterization of bacteria present in either sediment or seawater, with fewer studies characterizing both sediment and seawater together at a given site, and even fewer studies including information about non-bacterial microbial communities. As a result, knowledge about the ecological patterns of microbial biodiversity across domains and habitats in coastal communities is limited-despite the fact that archaea, bacteria, and microbial eukaryotes are present and known to interact in coastal habitats. To better understand microbial biodiversity patterns in coastal ecosystems, we characterized sediment and seawater microbial communities for three sites along the coastline of Puerto Nuevo, Baja California, Mexico using both 16S and 18S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. We found that sediment hosted approximately 500-fold more operational taxonomic units (OTUs) for bacteria, archaea, and microbial eukaryotes than seawater (p < 0.001). Distinct phyla were found in sediment versus seawater samples. Of the top ten most abundant classes, Cytophagia (bacterial) and Chromadorea (eukaryal) were specific to the sediment environment, whereas Cyanobacteria and Bacteroidia (bacterial) and Chlorophyceae (eukaryal) were specific to the seawater environment. A total of 47 unique genera were observed to comprise the core taxa community across environment types and sites. No archaeal taxa were observed as part of either the abundant or core taxa. No significant differences were observed for sediment community composition across domains or between sites. For seawater, the bacterial and archaeal community composition was statistically different for the Major Outlet site (p < 0.05), the site closest to a residential area, and the eukaryal community composition was statistically different between all sites (p < 0.05).

However, the extent to which these mechanisms differ in importance based on traits of taxa with different niche breadth is poorly understood. Here, we used high-throughput sequencing to examine the relative importance of environmental selection and stochastic processes in shaping soil bacterial sub-communities with different niche breadth (including habitat generalists, specialists and other taxa) across elevational gradients on the subalpine slope of Mount Wutai, Northern China. Our findings suggested that the composition of soil bacterial communities differed significantly different among elevational gradients. According to the niche breadth index, 10.9% of OTUs were defined as habitat generalists (B-value >8.7) and 10.0% of OTUs were defined as habitat specialists (B-value <1.5). Generalists and specialists differed distinctly in diversity and biogeographic patterns across elevational gradients. Environmental selection (deterministic processes) and spatial factors (stochastic processes) seemed to determine the assembly and biogeography of habitat generalists. However, for specialists, deterministic processes strongly influenced the distribution, while stochastic processes were not at play. Environmental drivers for generalists and specialists differed, as did their importance. Elevation, total nitrogen and pH were the main factors determining habitat generalists, and soil water content, nitrate nitrogen and pH had the strongest impacts on specialists. Moreover, variation partitioning analysis revealed that environmental selection had a much greater impact on both generalists (17.7% of pure variance was explained) and specialists (3.6%) than spatial factors. However, generalists had a much stronger response to spatial factors (2.3%) than specialists (0.3%). More importantly, null models of s-diversity suggested that specialists deviated significantly from non-neutral assembly mechanisms (relative null deviation= 0.64-0.74) relative to generalists (0.16-0.65) (P < 0.05). These results indicate that generalists and specialists are governed by different assembly mechanisms and present distinct biogeographical patterns. The large proportion of unexplained variation in specialists (93.3%) implies that very complex assembly mechanisms exist in the assembly of specialists across elevational gradients on the subalpine slope of Mount Wutai.

Typical soil characteristics, climate data, and plant composition clearly split the two sites and major differences among the microbial communities for the areas were initially expected. Overall, high values of microbial species richness (up to 2300 taxa) and ecological diversity was detected in both sites. High genetic novelty levels were found mostly to environmental sequences, highlighting the high potential for microbiological studies. In contrast to the initial expectations, a substantial overlapping between Monegros and Gallocanta microbes was observed, indicating a high similarity despite of the geographical, botanical and environmental distances between sites, in agreement with both high dispersal and local selection inherent to the microbial world. The potential biogeochemical cycling showed small differences between sites, with presence of photosynthetic green and purple sulfur bacteria, cyanobacteria and aerobic and anaerobic chemolitotrophs. Potential for aerobic methane oxidation and anaerobic methanogenesis was observed in both sites, with predominance of potential nitrification mostly by ammonia-oxidizing archaea, nitrite oxidation and denitrification, and minor contribution for nitrate reduction and nitrate ammonification. The predicted functions based on the taxonomic composition showed high overlapping between the two studied regions, despite their difference in gypsum richness. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Imbalances of the microbial populations, called dysbiosis, are related to several pathological status, emphasizing the importance of understanding the gut bacterial ecology. Among the ecological drivers of the microbiota, the spatial structure of the colon is of special interest: spatio-temporal mechanisms can lead to the constitution of spatial interactions among the bacterial populations and of environmental niches that impact the overall colonization of the colon. In the present study, we introduce a mathematical model of the colon microbiota in its fluid environment, based on the explicit coupling of a population dynamics model of microbial populations involved in fibre degradation with a fluid dynamics model of the luminal content. This modeling framework is used to study the main drivers of the spatial structure of the microbiota, specially focusing on the dietary fibre inflow, the epithelial motility, the microbial active swimming and viscosity gradients in the digestive track. We found 1) that the viscosity gradients allow the creation of favorable niches in the vicinity of the mucus layer; 2) that very low microbial active swimming in the radial direction is enough to promote bacterial growth, which sheds a new light on microbial motility in the colon and 3) that dietary fibres are the main driver of the spatial structure of the microbiota in the distal bowel whereas epithelial motility is preponderant for the colonization of the proximal colon; in the transverse colon, fibre levels and chemotaxis have the strongest impact on the distribution of the microbial communities.

Long-distance dispersal might also spread micro-organisms across large geographical areas. However, so far, to which extent selection mechanisms that shape hosts population genetics are mirrored in the population structure of the enteric microbiome remains unclear. High dispersal rates and horizontal parental transfer may homogenize bacterial communities between breeding sites (homogeneous hypothesis). Alternatively, strong selection from the local environment may differentiate bacterial communities between breeding sites (heterogeneous hypothesis). Furthermore, selection from age-specific environmental or physiological factors may differentiate the microbiome between juveniles and adults. Here, we analyzed the cloacal bacterial 16S rRNA gene of fledgling greater flamingos, Phoenicopterus roseus, across nine western Mediterranean breeding sites and four breeding seasons (n = 731) and adult birds (n = 27) from a single site. We found that fledgling cloacal microbiome, as measured by alpha diversity, beta diversity, the relative abundance of assigned sequence variants (ASVs) belonging to a phylum and genus composition within phylum, varied significantly between sampling sites and across time within site despite high adult dispersal rates. The spatio-temporal effects were stronger on individual ASV absence/presence than on ASV abundance (i.e., than on core microbiome composition). Spatial effects had a stronger effect than temporal effects, particularly on ASV abundance. Our study supports the heterogeneous hypothesis whereby local environmental conditions select and differentiate bacterial communities, thus countering the homogenizing effects of high-dispersing host species. In addition, differences in core microbiome between adult vs. fledgling samples suggests that differences in age-specific environmental and/or physiological factors result in differential selection pressure of core enteric microbiome between age classes, even within the same environment. In particular, the genus Corynebacterium, associated with both seasonal fat uptake and migration in previous studies, was much more abundant in high-dispersing fledglings than in more resident adults. To conclude, selection mechanisms that shape the hosts genetic structure cannot be extended to the genetic structure of the enteric microbiome, which has important implications regarding our understanding of both host local adaptation mechanisms and enteric microbiome population genetics.",2019,10,10.3389/fmicb.2019.00035
"Li, GH; Su, L; Zhang, QQ; Zhang, XL; Gong, J",Molecular diversity and biogeography of benthic ciliates in the Bohai Sea and Yellow Sea,ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA,"This study explored the molecular diversity and biogeography of benthic ciliates in Chinese marginal seas, the Bohai Sea (BHS), North Yellow Sea (NYS) and South Yellow Sea (SYS). From a previous 18S rRNA gene pyrosequencing dataset of the benthic microeukaryotes, we retrieved the sequences affiliated with phylum Ciliophora and analyzed alpha and beta diversities of ciliate communities. We found that BHS had the highest ciliate operational taxonomic unit (OTU) richness than NYS and SYS, whereas the richness was not significantly different between summer and winter. Among all the measured environmental variables, water depth showed consistently the strongest correlations with alpha diversities. Overall, the class Spirotrichea (mostly Choreotrichia and unassigned lineages within the class) dominated the communities in terms of both relative proportion of sequences (77.0%) and OTU richness (66.5%). OTU-level ciliate community structure was significant different among the three basins, but not between the seasons. Structurally, significant differences in relative proportion among the basins were detected for the class Litostomatea, but not for other classes. Partial Mantel tests demonstrated that water depth difference was more important than geographic and environment distances in shaping the community structure of benthic ciliates in the studied area. About 60% OTUs were not assigned at a class or order level and at least 45% OTUs shared a sequence similarity no more than 97% with the described species, indicating a great potential for ciliate species discovery in the offshore sediments. Compared with previous morphology-based surveys, the spatial pattern of ciliate diversity (decreasing from NYS to SYS) is also identified in the present study. Nevertheless, structurally, the dominant class appeared to be Spirotrichea in the sequencing dataset, which differs from previous morphology-based results (dominance of classes Prostomatea and Karyorelictea in biomass). The potential causes for the discrepancies between molecular and morphological findings are also discussed.",2019,38,10.1007/s13131-018-1236-y
"Dorman, HE; Wallace, LE",Diversity of Nitrogen-Fixing Symbionts of Chamaecrista fasciculata (Partridge Pea) Across Variable Soils,SOUTHEASTERN NATURALIST,"We evaluated whether geographic distance and soil characteristics influence genetic structure of nitrogen-fixing bacterial symbionts associated with the host plant Chamaecrista fasciculata (Partridge Pea). We tested phylogeographic clustering and associations between genetic distance, geographic distance, and soil variables using sequences of 2 bacterial genes and soil chemistry across 23 sites in Mississippi. We identified rhizobia isolated from Partridge Pea as Bradyrhizobium. We detected significant genetic structure at a regional level, and determined that rhizobia within each region were more phylogenetically related than expected. Significant correlation between genetic distance and distances based on soil chemistry suggests environmental influences on rhizobia diversity. High levels of diversity among rhizobia over small spatial scales suggest that symbionts respond to local factors. Understanding geographic diversity in natural assemblages of rhizobia aids in predicting how hosts and symbionts respond to environmental perturbations.",2019,18,10.1656/058.018.0110

This is the first field study to test the hypothesis that fungi are responsible for driving bacterial communities in beech wood (Fagus sylvatica). A meta-genetic approach was used to characterise bacterial and fungal communities in wood that had been laboratory-colonised with known wood-decay fungi, and left for a year at six woodland sites. Alpha-, Beta- and Gammaproteobacteria and Acidobacteria were the proportionally dominant bacterial taxa, as in previous studies. Pre-colonising wood with decay fungi had a clear effect on the bacterial community, apparently via direct fungal influence; the bacterial and fungal communities present at the time of collection explained nearly 60% of their mutual covariance. Site was less important than fungal influence in determining bacterial communities, but the effects of pre-colonisation were more pronounced at some sites than at others. Wood pH was also a strong bacterial predictor, but was itself under considerable fungal influence. Burkholderiaceae and Acidobacteriaceae showed directional responses against the trend of the bacterial community as a whole. The identity of the bacteria living in wood is influenced by the identity of the fungi living there.",2019,95,10.1093/femsec/fiy225

The goal of this study was to characterize how soil bacterial communities vary across diurnal, sub-seasonal and seasonal time-scales in a 5.8 m(2) plot and test the hypothesis that bacterial diversity varies on each of these scales. We used 16S rDNA gene amplicon sequencing to quantify the alpha and beta diversity of soil bacteria as well as the Net Relatedness Index and Nearest Taxon Indices to assess the degree of phylogenetic clustering, and the extent to which community shifts were driven by stochastic vs. deterministic limitation. We found that species richness was highest in winter, lowest in fall and that communities were compositionally distinct across seasons. There was no evidence of diurnal-scale shifts; the finest temporal scale over which community shifts were detected using our DNA-based analysis was between sampling dates separated by 6 weeks. Phylogenetic analyses suggested that seasonal-scale differences in community composition were the result of environmental filtering and homogeneous selection. Our findings provide insight into temporal variation of soil bacterial communities across the hourly to seasonal scales while minimizing the potential confounding effect of spatial variation. Soil bacterial communities are distinct across the four seasons and at the sub-seasonal scale, but not the dirunal-scale, in a temperate deciduous forest.",2019,95,10.1093/femsec/fiz002

Here, we investigated bacterial distribution across a high elevational gradient (4328-5228 m a.s.l.) along the Nyainqentanglha mountains on the Southwestern Tibetan Plateau. We found a decreasing diversity trend with increasing elevation, with pH contributing most to the diversity variation, followed by elevation and mean annual temperature (MAT). Bacterial community composition differed taxonomically and phylogenetically with elevation. Furthermore, partial Mantel analyzes showed that bacterial community composition was significantly influenced by elevation, pH and MAT. Phylogenetic structure analysis indicated that deterministic processes (related to pH) determined bacterial community assembly along this elevation gradient. Our results reinforce the observed rule that pH is of foremost importance in driving bacterial elevational diversity patterns. We also suggest that absence of tree cover and of human disturbance might be important in allowing an underlying elevational trend to reveal itself. Review of other studies suggests that the trend of decreasing diversity at higher elevations might be generally true above the tree line.

Bacteria were isolated and identified based on physiological and biochemical characters and BOX-PCR. Followed by qualitative and/or quantitative analysis of their secondary metabolites. 50 soil bacteria were affected to the two groups of fluorescent (72%) and non-fluorescent Pseudomonads (28%). The UPGMA (Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean) showed five phenons of carbon sources assimilation; at the time that BOX-PCR profiling resulted in five clusters characterized by 29 different haplotypes.

However, it remains unclear how and to which extent it affects aquatic microbial communities, especially in heavily polluted rivers. In this study, a significant environmental gradient, particularly nitrogen gradient, was observed along a wastewater receiving river, the North Canal River (NCR). The pollution level was highest, moderate, and lowest in the up-, middle, and clown streams, respectively. The community composition of bacterioplankton transitioned from being Betaproteobacteria-dominated upstream to Gammaproteobacteria-dominated downstream. Copiotrophic groups, such as Polynucleobacter (Betaproteobacteria) and Hydrogenophaga (Betaproteobacteria), were dominant in the upstream. Multiple statistical analyses indicated that total nitrogen (TN) was the most important factor driving the adaptive shifts of community structure. Analyses of co-occurrence networks showed that the complexity of networks was disrupted in the up- and middle streams, while enhanced in the downstream. Our findings here suggested that microbial interactions were reduced in response to the aggravation of nutrient pollution. Similar to these changes, we observed significant dissimilarity of composition of functional groups, with highest abundance of nitrogen metabolism members under the highest level of nitrogen enrichment. Further analyses indicated that most of these functional groups belonged to Betaproteobacteria, suggesting the potential coupling of community composition and function diversity. In summary, adaptive shifts of bacterioplankton community composition, as well as species interactions, occurred in response to nutrient pollution in highly polluted water bodies.

"Gruber, A",Whats in a name? How organelles of endosymbiotic origin can be distinguished from endosymbionts,MICROBIAL CELL,"Mitochondria and plastids evolved from free-living bacteria, but are now considered integral parts of the eukaryotic species in which they live. Therefore, they are implicitly called by the same eukaryotic species name. Historically, mitochondria and plastids were known as organelles, even before their bacterial origin became fully established. However, since organelle evolution by endosymbiosis has become an established theory in biology, more and more endosymbiotic systems have been discovered that show various levels of host/symbiont integration. In this context, the distinction between host/symbiont and eukaryote/organelle systems is currently unclear. The criteria that are commonly considered are genetic integration (via gene transfer from the endosymbiont to the nucleus), cellular integration (synchronization of the cell cycles), and metabolic integration (the mutual dependency of the metabolisms). Here, I suggest that these criteria should be evaluated according to the resulting coupling of genetic recombination between individuals and congruence of effective population sizes, which determines if independent speciation is possible for either of the partners. I would like to call this aspect of integration sexual symbiont integration. If the partners lose their independence in speciation, I think that they should be considered one species. The partner who maintains its genetic recombination mechanisms and life cycle should then be the name giving host; the other one would be the organelle. Distinguishing between organelles and symbionts according to their sexual symbiont integration is independent of any particular mechanism or structural property of the endosymbiont/host system under investigation.",2019,6,10.15698/mic2019.02.668

We developed state-factor models with machine learning to understand better and to predict the abundance of 10 dominant phyla and bacterial diversities in Australian soils, the latter expressed by the Chao and Shannon indices. In the models, we used proxies for the edaphic, climatic, biotic and topographic factors, which included soil properties, environmental variables, and the absorbance at visible-near infrared (vis-NIR) wavelengths. From a cross-validation with all observations (n = 681), we found that our models explained 43-73% of the variance in bacterial phyla abundance and diversity. The vis-NIR spectra, which represent the organic and mineral composition of soil, were prominent drivers of abundance and diversity in the models, as were changes in the soil-water balance, potential evapotranspiration, and soil nutrients. From independent validations, we found that spectr-otransfer functions could predict well the phyla Acidobacteria and Actinobacteria (R-2 > 0.7) as well as other dominant phyla and the Chao and Shannon diversities (R-2 > 0.5). Predictions of the phyla Firmicutes were the poorest (R-2 = 0.42).

In Prochlorococcus, there is a clear phylogenetic hierarchy of ecotypes, whereas multiple Synechococcus clades have overlapping physiologies and environmental distributions. However, microbial traits are associated with different phylogenetic depths. Using this principle, we reclassified diversity at different phylogenetic levels and compared the phylogeography. We sequenced the genetic diversity of Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus from 339 samples across the tropical Pacific Ocean and North Atlantic Ocean using a highly variable phylogenetic marker gene (rpoC1). We observed clear parallel niche distributions of ecotypes leading to high Piankas Index values driven by distinct shifts at two transition points. The first transition point at 6 degrees N distinguished ecotypes adapted to warm waters but separated by macronutrient content. At 39 degrees N, ecotypes adapted to warm, low macronutrient vs. colder, high macronutrient waters shifted. Finally, we detected parallel vertical and regional single-nucleotide polymorphism microdiversity within clades from both Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus, suggesting uniquely adapted populations at very specific depths, as well as between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.

This study examined the influence of soil physico-chemical properties and topographic features on bacterial communities and diversity in a commercial potato field with a rolling landform. Eighty-three soil samples were systematically collected across a transect 1100 m long. A significant negative correlation (r = -0.73) between soil pH (range 4.3-7.0) and slope gradient (range 1.8-11.9%) was observed. Regressions and/or a canonical correspondence analysis showed that pH, slope gradient and organic carbon were the major factors influencing bacterial a-diversity based on 16S rRNA gene sequences. Semivariogram analyses revealed that the bacterial adiversity, the relative abundance of most phyla, pH and slope gradient showed strong to medium spatial autocorrelations with a range between 20.8 and 217.8 m. These results evidenced that soil pH and slope gradient were the major factors explaining variation in the spatial structure of the bacterial community. Our results showed that the soil bacterial communities varied in a systematic and predictable pattern in an agricultural field in response to variation in soil physico-chemical properties and topographic features.",2019,335,10.1016/j.geoderma.2018.08.016

Bacteria are important to this symbiosis, with diverse functions such as providing nutrients to the symbiont and pathogen protection to the cnidarian. Disrupted bacterial communities are associated with thermally stressed cnidarians, which have a higher likelihood of expelling their symbionts, an event called bleaching. To better understand the association between thermal tolerance and bacterial community structure, we studied communities associated with an exceptionally thermal tolerant cnidarian, Anthopleura elegantissima. This intertidal symbiotic sea anemone is distributed from the subtropical waters of Baja California to subarctic Alaska, and experiences daily temperature fluctuations of up to 20 degrees C. It is also flexible in its symbioses, predominantly hosting Symbiodinium, but occasionally hosting the green algae Elliptochloris marina or existing without symbionts in an aposymbiotic state. We used 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to characterize the natural variation of microbial communities associated with Anthopleura elegantissima in these three symbiotic states and across a latitudinal gradient. In this study, we identified a core microbiome, made up predominantly of low-abundance taxa. We found that the communities associated with A. elegantissima were weakly linked to latitude. Diversity analyses revealed significantly higher species richness values for microbial communities associated with anemones hosting E. marina. Lastly the microbiome communities associated with different symbiotic states were compositionally distinct. Taken together, our results suggest that the structure of microbial communities associated with these temperate cnidarians is tightly linked to symbiotic state and weakly linked to other biogeographic phenomena.",2019,6,10.3389/fmars.2019.00007
"Ma, ZS; Li, LW",Semen Microbiome Biogeography: An Analysis Based on a Chinese Population Study,FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY,"Investigating inter-subject heterogeneity (or spatial distribution) of human semen microbiome diversity is of important significance. Theoretically, the spatial distribution of biodiversity constitutes the core of microbiome biogeography. Practically, the inter-subject heterogeneity is crucial for understanding the normal (healthy) flora of semen microbiotas as well as their possible changes associated with abnormal fertility. In this article, we analyze the scaling (changes) of semen microbiome diversity across individuals with DAR (diversity-area relationship) analysis, a recent extension to classic SAR (species-area relationship) law in biogeography and ecology. Specifically, the unit of area is individual subject, and the microbial diversity in seminal fluid of an individual (area) is assessed via metagenomic DNA sequencing technique and measured in the Hill numbers. The DAR models were then fitted to the accrued diversity across different number of individuals (area size). We further tested the difference in DAR parameters among the healthy, subnormal, and abnormal microbiome samples in terms of their fertility status based on a cross-sectional study of a Chinese cohort. Given that no statistically significant differences in the DAR parameters were detected among the three groups, we built unified DAR models for semen microbiome by combining the healthy, subnormal, and abnormal groups. The model parameters were used to (i) estimate the microbiome diversity scaling in a population (cohort), and construct the so-termed DAR profile; (ii) predict/construct the maximal accrual diversity (MAD) profile in a population; (iii) estimate the pair-wise diversity overlap (PDO) between two individuals and construct the PDO profile; (iv) assess the ratio of individual diversity to population (RIP) accrual diversity. The last item(RIP) is a new concept we propose in this study, which is essentially a ratio of local diversity to regional or global diversity (LRD/LGD), applicable to general biodiversity investigation beyond human microbiome.",2019,9,10.3389/fmicb.2018.03333

To provide a broader biogeographical context of archaeal diversity, this study quantified the abundance and community composition of archaea across the black soil zone in northeast China using real-time PCR and high-throughput sequencing (HTS) methods. Archaeal abundances across all soil samples ranged from 4.04 x 10(7)to 26.18 x 10(7)16S rRNA gene copies per gram of dry soil. Several soil factors were positively correlated with the abundances including soil pH, concentrations of total C, N, and P, and available Kin soil, and soil water content. Approximately 94.2, 5.7, and 0.3% of archaeal sequences, and 31, 151, and 3 OTUs aligned within the phyla Thaumarchaeota, Euryarchaeota, and Crenarchaeota, respectively. Within the phylum of Thaumarchaeota, group 1.1b was a dominating genus accounting for an average of 87% archaeal sequences and phylogenetically classified as Nitrososphaera, a genus of ammonia oxidizing archaea. The response of dominating OTUs to environmental factors differed greatly, suggesting the physiological characteristics of different archaeal members is diversified in the black soils. Although the number of OTUs was not related with any particular soil parameters, the number of OTUs within Thaumarchaeota and Euryarchaeota was marginally related with soil pH. Archaeal community compositions differed between samples, and a Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) analysis indicated that soil pH and the latitude of sampling locations were two dominating factors in shifting community structures. A variance partitioning analysis (VPA) analysis showed that the selected soil parameters (32%) were the largest drivers of community variation, in particular soil pH (21%), followed by geographic distances (19%).

At the European scale, taxa area relationship (TAR) was significant, supporting spatial structuration of bacterial communities. Spatial variations in community diversity and structure were mainly driven by soil physicochemical parameters. Within soil clusters (k-means approach) corresponding to similar edaphic and climatic properties, but to multiple land uses, land use was a major driver of the bacterial communities.

Within these relict deposits, ancient microbial mats, or paleomats, have been preserved under extremely arid and cold conditions since the receding of larger paleolakes thousands of years ago, and now serve as a sheltered niche for microbes in a highly challenging oligotrophic environment. To explore whether paleomats could be repositories for ancient lake cells or were later colonized by soil microbes, determine what types of metabolic pathways might be present, analyze potential gene expression, and explore whether the cells are in a vegetative or dormant state, we collected paleomat samples from ancient lake facies on the northern slopes of Lake Vanda in Wright Valley in December 2016. Using a gentle lysis technique optimized to preserve longer molecules, combined with a polyenzymatic treatment to maximize yields from different cell types, we isolated high-molecular weight DNA and RNA from ancient paleomat samples. Community composition analysis suggests that the paleomat community may retain a population of indigenousmat cells that may flourish once more favorable conditions are met. In addition to harboring a diverse microbial community, paleomats appear to host heterotrophs in surrounding soils utilizing the deposits as a carbon source.

Most of the existing research focused on grape berries microbiota, since it can directly impact wine quality. In this work we studied, for the first time through next-generation sequencing, the epiphytic bacterial community of vine bark and its relationships with grape microbiota. The study was carried out in two Italian wine appellations (situated in different regions) to explore the impact of biogeography, and the influence of two agronomical practices (biodynamic and conventional) was evaluated as well. Overall, our results show that grapevine bark harbors a rich epiphytic microbiota and displays a higher microbial biodiversity than grape berry. Moreover, this study suggests that geographic and anthropogenic factors impact both bark and grape bacteriomes, but to a different extent. The evidence of a microbial terror seems to be even more marked in bark than in berries, possibly due to its permanence over time and to its physical proximity with soil. The importance of vine trunk bark, as potential source of inoculum for grapes and as interesting bacterial diversity habitat, is evidenced. This opens new fields of investigation, not only for researchers that aim at describing this little-known habitat within the vineyard, but also for stakeholders from the wine industry that want to understand the roles of microorganisms on the entire winemaking process, from vineyard to cellar.",2019,9,10.3389/fmicb.2018.03203

By sequencing the V3-V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene amplicons, the current study assessed the bacterial community assemblage in rhizosphere and bulks soils of wild (Glycine soja) and cultivated (Glycine max) soybeans grown in the suspensions of three important soil types in China, including black, red and soda-saline-alkali soils. The alpha-diversity of the bacterial community in the rhizosphere was significantly higher than that of the bulk soils suggesting that bulk soil lacks plant nurturing effect under the current study conditions. Black and red soils were enriched with nitrifying and nitrogen-fixing bacteria but the soda-saline-alkali soil suspension had more denitrifying bacteria, which may reflect agronomic unsuitability of the latter. We also observed a high abundance of Bradyrhizobium and Pseudomonas, enriched cellulolytic bacteria, as well as a highly connected molecular ecological network in the G. soja rhizosphere soil. Taken all, the current study suggest that wild soybeans may have evolved to recruit beneficial microbes in its rhizosphere that can promote nutrients requisition, biostasis and disease-resistance, therefore ecologically more resilient than cultivated soybeans.",2019,65,10.1080/03650340.2018.1485147
"Griffith, CA; Shang, P; Lu, YH; Theuerkauf, EJ; Rodriguez, AB; Findlay, RH",Agricultural land use impacts microbial community structure of streambed sediments,AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,"Agricultural land use is known to adversely affect freshwater ecosystems, and recent studies have shown that it can significantly alter dissolved organic matter (DOM) concentrations and quality. DOM quantity and quality are key determinants of microbial community structure in streams and have been linked to changes in community abundance and composition. Considering the vital ecological role sediment microbes play in stream ecosystems, it is important to understand how agricultural land use changes affect stream microbial community structure. This study was conducted to determine if variation in sediment microbial biomass community structure could be attributed to differences in agricultural land use. Microbial biomass, microbial community structure, and stream water parameters were compared on 2 dates from 6 sites representing a gradient of agricultural land use from 18 to 64 % within the Bear Creek Watershed in northwest Alabama, USA. Total microbial biomass, determined as phospholipid phosphate, was strongly influenced by sediment surface area and, to a lesser extent, correlated with sampling date and land use. Sediment microbial community structure, determined by phospholipid fatty acid analysis, was significantly correlated to percent agricultural land use in the watershed, as well as stream water DOM humification index, and sediment delta N-15 values and surface area. Microbial community structure also differed between sampling dates. These findings demonstrate that agricultural land use is linked via alteration of stream water and sediment organic matter to changes in sediment microbial structure which may, at least in part, account for widely observed changes in stream ecosystem functioning associated with agricultural activities.",2019,83,10.3354/ame01905

Area of study: The study was carried out at two locations (San Antonio Cayal and Nuevo Progreso municipalities) of Campeche State, Mexico. Material and methods: Two experimental stages were performed: 1) isolation, morphological and biochemical characterization, and molecular identification of endophytic bacteria from root-nodules of four soybean varieties grown at field conditions; and 2) evaluation of the effects of endophytic isolates on soybean growth and nodule development, and the effects of bacterial co-inoculation on soybean plants, under controlled conditions. Main results: Twenty-three endophytic bacteria were isolated from root nodules, and identified as Agrobacterium, Bradyrhizobium, Rhizobium, Ensifer, Massilia, Chryseobacterium, Enterobacter, Microbacterium, Serratia, and Xanthomonas. Under controlled conditions, Rhizobium sp. CPO4.13C or Agrobacterium tumefaciens CPO4.15C significantly increased the plant height (46% and 41%, respectively), whereas Bradyrhizobium sp. CPO4.24C promoted the nodule formation (36 nodules/plant). The co-inoculation of B. japonicum USDA110 and Bradyrhizobium sp. CPO4.24C enhanced plant growth, height (33.87 cm), root nodulation (69 nodules/plant) and N-fixation (3.10 mu mol C2H4 h(-1) plant(-1)) in comparison to the negative control. Research highlights: Results suggest that the native Bradyrhizobium sp.

"Jian, HH; Xiao, X",Characteristics and ecological functions of deep-sea viruses,CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE,"Believed to be the most abundant (similar to 10(30)) biological agents in the ocean, viruses play an important role in microbial metabolism, prokaryotic mortality, and nutrient recycling in marine ecosystems, thereby significantly influencing the geochemical cycles of our planet. The importance of viruses in the surface ocean has been well recognized, however we are just beginning to understand the viral role and the underlying mechanism in the deep ocean. As an essential part of the marine environment, the abyssal ocean has extensive material and energy exchanges with the upper ocean and the deep biosphere, and they constitute an integral whole of the marine ecosystem. With an average depth of approximately 3800 m, the benthic environment is characterized by total darkness, low temperature (<4 degrees C), and high hydrostatic pressure (>10 MPa). The deep-sea inhabited microorganisms, including viruses, are believed to develop unique strategy to survive under multiple extreme environmental stresses. Studies on deep-sea viruses have revealed their abundance, diversity, and important ecological functions. In this review, advances in research on deep-sea viruses are summarized into four parts: general features, relationship between environmental factors and deep-sea viruses, isolation and characterization of representative viruses, and significant influences of the viriobenthos on the physiological and ecological function of deepsea microorganisms. In general, the functions of viruses in the deep-sea environment mainly include two aspects: First, the regulation of material and energy cycle (viral shunt) and the dynamic change in ecosystem composition (balance of microbial communities) modulated by viral lysis; second, the expression of viral metabolic related genes (auxiliary metabolism) and the effect of viruses on host physiological activities (environmental adaptability). The former has been widely recognized, but the influence and molecular mechanism of the latter in the extreme deep-sea environment need to be further investigated. Here, we propose research directions and challenges in this field to undertake in future studies. Notably, the relationship between environmental factors and deep-sea viruses remains poorly understood. A deep-sea viral-host model system must be developed to investigate the underlying regulatory mechanism of gene expression and the interaction between deep-sea viruses and their hosts under extreme environmental conditions. At present, the number of isolated deep-sea viruses is less than 30, which is below 1% of the total number of viruses in the International Virus Classification Database. In terms of classification, most of the isolated deep-sea viruses belong to Caudovirales, and nearly no representatives have been identified yet from other viral orders. Furthermore, deep-sea viruses have been rarely subjected to in-depth study possibly because of very few benthic microorganisms with genetic operating system. In addition to maximizing the use of existing virus-host systems, scholars must focus on isolating other representative deepsea viruses. Although our understanding on viriobenthos is still far from complete, data provided here encourage us to hypothesize that viruses are the key component of the benthic ecosystem and play an indispensable role in the deep ocean and deep biosphere.",2019,64,10.1360/N972018-01150

However, despite the importance of soil microbial communities in almost all soil biochemical processes and ecosystem functions, the biogeography of soil microbial communities on the Tibetan Plateau is poorly understood, especially at large scales over different ecosystem types. In this study, we collected samples from 64 sampling sites representing different grassland ecosystem types and spanning 2121 km across on the Tibetan Plateau. We then used next generation high-throughput sequencing to investigate the soil prokaryote community (i.e. bacteria and archaea) diversity and spatial patterns and to explore their relationship with biotic (e.g. plant functional group diversity and biomass) and abiotic (e.g. aridity index, soil carbon and nitrogen levels) factors. Among the four alpine grassland types (i.e. alpine meadow, alpine steppe, alpine shrub and alpine desert) sampled in this study, alpine meadow had the highest soil microbial biomass and alpine desert had the lowest soil microbial richness and Shannon diversity. The soil microbial diversity in the alpine grassland correlated with plant diversity and climate factors. Soil microbial diversity negatively correlated with the annual average air temperature, but was not correlated with the annual average precipitation, indicating that temperature, rather than precipitation, may be more important in controlling the soil microbial diversity in alpine grassland ecosystems at cold temperatures. Higher air temperature likely led to an intensified aridity under limited precipitation, and thus decreased microbial diversity. As a result, the aridity index combined with temperature and precipitation explained more of the variance in the soil microbial diversity than air temperature or precipitation did individually. Moreover, after separating plant species into four functional groups (grass, forb, legume and sedge), microbial diversity positively correlated with plant functional group diversity, explaining more of the variance in microbial diversity than plant species diversity did. Results of structural equation modeling revealed that the aridity index and annual air temperature affected soil microbial diversity, directly or indirectly, through influencing plant functional group diversity and aboveground biomass; while aboveground biomass changed the soil carbon to nitrogen ratio in the upper soil layers and thus impacted soil microbial diversity. However, in contrast to microbial diversity, soil microbial biomass carbon was not correlated with plant functional group diversity, plant species diversity, or the climate factors annual average air temperature, annual precipitation and aridity index, but were linked to soil nutrient status (e.g. soil dissolved organic carbon, ammonia, available phosphorus, and carbon to nitrogen ratio) and plant biomass of sedges and forbs, demonstrating that microbial biomass and diversity were likely controlled by different factors. In summary, this study investigated the spatial patterns of soil microbial communities across different alpine grassland ecosystem types on the Tibetan Plateau and enhanced our understanding of biotic and abiotic factors controlling microbial biomass and diversity, which will be important in predicting microbial changes on the Tibetan Plateau under future climate change. Under future warming and wetting scenarios on the Tibetan Plateau, it is possible that the aridity index would decrease, leading to increased soil microbial diversity. Results of this study also suggest a focus on the aridity index and plant functional group diversity in future microbial biogeography studies in order to further determine their roles in controlling or mediating soil microbial biomass and diversity.",2019,64,10.1360/TB-2019-0090

Farming system influences grapes yeast populations and, therefore, fermentation dynamics and wine quality. This work aims to study yeast diversity on grapes and musts from organic and conventional production in different areas within Galicia (NW Spain) and to evaluate the existence of yeast geographic patterns (microbial terroir) in this region. Methods and results: During the 2015 vintage, 42 grape samples were collected from four Denominations of Origin (DOs) in Galicia. Representative cultivable yeasts from grapes and must samples were isolated and characterised at the species level in the Estacion de Viticultura e Enoloxia de Galicia (EVEGA-AGACAL). Results were compared among DOs and between organic and conventional production. A total of 33 yeast species were identified. Organic production showed 27.3% higher species richness than conventional production. Accordingly, diversity indexes (H and E) were higher under organic cultures compared to conventional production. The highest yeast diversity was found in Rias Baixas and Ribeira Sacra DOs. The predominant yeasts were Aureobasidium spp., Metschnikowia spp., Hanseniaspora uvarum and Cryptococcus spp., although their proportion varied depending on the farming system and location. Furthermore, important differences were observed in minor species, which appeared mainly in organic cultivation. In addition, a biogeographic pattern was found: Issatchenkia terricola and Starmerella bacillaris were isolated in Rias Baixas and Ribeira Sacra DOs, whereas Lachancea thermotolerans was ligated to Monterrei and Ribeiro DOs. ANOSIM, PERMANOVA and PCA analysis confirmed this differentiation. Conclusions: The results indicated that an organic farming system favoured yeast diversity on grapes and musts. Moreover, species distribution made it possible to establish a biogeographic pattern in the yeast population that could be associated to a particular microbial terroir and wine typicality. Significance and impact of the study: This study reports for the first time a survey on yeast diversity on grapes and musts from organic and conventional production in different areas within Galicia. The results highlighted the role of organic culture as a tool to preserve yeast richness and the existence of biogeographic patterns of yeast communities in vineyards in NW Spain, which could contribute to wine typicality of specific areas.",2019,53,

The number of bands (S) and Jaccard similarity coefficient were determined from band profiles of DGGE gels. The profiles obtained from amplification of DNA fragments allowed identifying unique species in the first 5 cm of the soil for MA, AC and PN uses as well as for MA and PN from 5 to 20 cm depth. On the other hand, shared fragments were observed among the three soil uses. The dendrogram identified two groups, with similarity coefficient close to 35%.

Red ice patches on penitentes contained a microbial community dominated by algae in the genera Chlamydomonas and Chloromonas, both of which were closely related to known snow algae from alpine and polar environments. In contrast, we obtained few snow algae sequences from clear ice, but we did find cyanobacteria sequences and evidence of aeolian-deposited organic matter. Tephra (soil) within and just downhill from the penitente field hosted more complex bacterial and eukaryotic communities that were significantly different from ice communities in terms of both alpha and beta diversity. In this environment penitentes provide both water and shelter from harsh winds, high UV radiation, and thermal fluctuations, creating an oasis in an otherwise extreme landscape. Intriguingly, recent planetary investigations have suggested the existence of penitente-like structures on other planetary bodies of our solar system. Therefore, penitentes and the harsh environment that surrounds them provide a new terrestrial analog for astrobiological studies of life beyond Earth.",2019,51,10.1080/15230430.2019.1618115

In addition to size and weight constraints on PBAs to be lifted into the air column, local meteorological features dominate the fate of bioaerosols and their possible inclusion in long-range transport. For organic particles to be included into long distant dispersal, they have to overcome surface vertical mixing of the planetary boundary layer (PBL) to reach levels of laminar air movement. Hence, the biogeography of PBAs along a vertical distribution through the PBL needed further study. To assess the microbial biodiversity along an altitudinal gradient, air samples were collected between 1,000 and 3,100 m above sea level at Mount Sonnblick in the Austrian Alps. 16S rRNA gene and internal transcribed spacer sequencing for bacteria and fungi, respectively, were used to define distinct microbial communities that were separated by the PBL. Up to the top of the PBL, plant-associated bacteria and fungi were detected and were subjected to limited vertical dispersal due to size-constraints. This indicates that those communities become aerosolised but were not lifted into higher altitudes. However, a variety of ubiquitous, thermophilic strains that are often identified with heavy dust events and high endurance towards extreme conditions were significantly increased (relative abundance) at higher elevations. The lack of information on vertical dispersal is due to reliance on ground-based investigations that bias the interpretation of dispersal dynamics. Thus, to understand the mechanisms for near-ground communities to become airborne and subsequently included in long-range transport, we recommend investigating meteorological driving forces for an improved biogeographical assessment. Here, we show, for the first time, an assessment of the biogeography of bacterial and fungal assemblages along a vertical alpine air column transect.",2019,6,10.1002/geo2.69

Here, quantitative polymerase chain reaction and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism were used to determine the spatial distribution of free-living nitrogen-fixing bacteria along a slope gradient. Plant communities were evaluated through field surveys, and basic soil properties were measured in the laboratory. Soil properties (e.g., soil available phosphorus, soil organic carbon, and total nitrogen) were higher in upper-and middle -slope soils than in lower-slope soils, while bacterial abundance was the opposite. Bacterial and plant communities all varied along the slope gradient. Redundancy analysis revealed that bacterial community composition was closely linked to pH, soil organic carbon, available phosphorus, and total nitrogen.

The present study was conducted to investigate the diversity, composition, and function of both entire and potentially active archaeal communities within Pacific deep-sea sediments. For this purpose, sediment samples were taken along the 180 degrees meridian of the central Pacific Ocean. Community composition and diversity were assessed by Illumina tag sequencing targeting archaeal 16S rRNA genes and transcripts. Archaeal communities were dominated by Candidatus Nitrosopumilus (Thaumarchaeota) and other members of the Nitrosopumilaceae (Thaumarchaeota), but higher relative abundances of the Marine Group II (Euryarchaeota) were observed in the active compared to the entire archaeal community. The composition of the entire and the active archaeal communities was strongly linked to primary production (chlorophyll content), explaining more than 40% of the variance. Furthermore, we found a strong correlation of the entire archaeal community composition to latitude and silicic acid content, while the active community was significantly correlated with primary production and ferric oxide content. We predicted functional profiles from 16S rRNA data to assess archaeal community functions. Latitude was significantly correlated with functional profiles of the entire community, whereas those of the active community were significantly correlated with nitrate and chlorophyll content.

To test the hypothesis that BEs impose selective pressures resulting in characteristic adaptive responses, we performed a pangenomics meta-analysis leveraging 189 genomes (accessed from GenBank) of two epidemiologically important taxa, Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus, isolated from various origins: the International Space Station (ISS; a model BE), Earth-based BEs, soil, and humans. Our objectives were to (i) identify differences in the pangenomic composition of generalist and host-associated organisms, (ii) characterize genes and functions involved in BE-associated selection, and (iii) identify genomic signatures of ISS-derived strains of potential relevance for astronaut health. The pangenome of B. cereus was more expansive than that of S. aureus, which had a dominant core component. Genomic contents of both taxa significantly correlated with isolate origin, demonstrating an importance for biogeography and potential niche adaptations. ISS/BE-enriched functions were often involved in biosynthesis, catabolism, materials transport, metabolism, and stress response. Multiple origin-enriched functions also overlapped across taxa, suggesting conserved adaptive processes. We further characterized two mobile genetic elements with local neighborhood genes encoding biosynthesis and stress response functions that distinctively associated with B. cereus from the ISS. Although antibiotic resistance genes were present in ISS/BE isolates, they were also common in counterparts elsewhere. Overall, despite differences in microbial lifestyle, some functions appear common to remaining viable in the BE, and those functions are not typically associated with direct impacts on human health. IMPORTANCE The built environment contains a variety of microorganisms, some of which pose critical human health risks (e. g., hospital-acquired infection, antibiotic resistance dissemination). We uncovered a combination of complex biological functions that may play a role in bacterial survival under the presumed selective pressures in a model built environment-the International Space Station-by using an approach to compare pangenomes of bacterial strains from two clinically relevant species (B. cereus and S. aureus) isolated from both built environments and humans.

However, it remains unclear about the relative roles of abiotic and biotic properties in controlling the abundance and activity of ammonia-oxidizing and denitrifying microorganisms in permafrost-affected soils.MethodsWe analysed the potential ammonia oxidation and denitrification rates (PAO and PDR), the abundance of archaeal amoA, bacterial amoA, nirK, nirS and nosZ genes, soil characteristics, climatic and plant properties across two vegetation types in Tibetan permafrost-affected soils. The relative importance of abiotic and biotic properties in driving functional N gene abundance, PAO and PDR were assessed using variation partition analysis (VPA) and random forest (RF) model.ResultsThe functional N gene abundance and PDR were lower in alpine steppe than in alpine meadow. Variations in the PAO and PDR and functional N gene abundance were mainly explained by abiotic variables such as organic carbon and total N, then by plant properties such as plant N concentration, plant species richness and productivity based on the VPA. The RF model showed that abiotic properties (e.g., precipitation) and plant properties (e.g., plant N concentration or plant productivity) predicted the PDR and the abundance of functional N genes. Both VPA and RF model showed that the PAO and PDR could be determined by the abundance of functional N genes such as archaeal amoA gene and nosZ gene, respectively.ConclusionsOur study highlights that abiotic and plant properties are important predictors of the abundance and activity of ammonia-oxidizing and denitrifying communities in permafrost-affected regions, implying that plant properties, which were previously overlooked, should be incorporated into ecosystem models for improved prediction of belowground N process rates in a changing environment.",2019,434,10.1007/s11104-018-3845-9

However, the diversity patterns and their environmental determinants across taxonomic scales are still poorly studied. By sampling along an extensive elevational gradient in subarctic ponds of Finland and Norway, we examined the diversity patterns of aquatic bacteria and fungi from whole community to individual taxa across taxonomic coverage and taxonomic resolutions. We further quantified cross-phylum congruence in multiple biodiversity metrics and evaluated the relative importance of climate, catchment and local pond variables as the hierarchical drivers of biodiversity across taxonomic scales. Bacterial community showed significantly decreasing elevational patterns in species richness and evenness, and U-shaped patterns in local contribution to beta diversity (LCBD). Conversely, no significant species richness and evenness patterns were found for fungal community. Elevational patterns in species richness and LCBD, but not in evenness, were congruent across bacterial phyla. When narrowing down the taxonomic scope towards higher resolutions, bacterial diversity showed weaker and more complex elevational patterns. Taxonomic downscaling also indicated a notable change in the relative importance of biodiversity determinants with stronger local environmental filtering, but decreased importance of climatic variables. This suggested that niche conservatism of temperature preference was phylogenetically deeper than that of water chemistry variables. Our results provide novel perspectives for microbial biogeography and highlight the importance of taxonomic scale dependency and hierarchical drivers when modelling biodiversity and species distribution responses to future climatic scenarios.",2019,28,10.1111/mec.14935
"Wilpiszeski, RL; Zhang, ZD; House, CH",Biogeography of thermophiles and predominance of Thermus scotoductus in domestic water heaters,EXTREMOPHILES,"Built systems such as water heaters can harbor extremophiles similar to those residing in natural hot springs, but the extent of colonization is not well understood. To address this, we conducted a survey of thermophilic microorganisms in household water heaters across the United States. Filter samples and inoculated cultures were collected by citizen-scientists from 101 homes. Draft genomes were assembled from cultured isolates and 16S rRNA genes were sequenced from filter samples. 28% of households harbored communities with unambiguous DNA signatures of thermophilic organisms, 36% of households provided viable inocula, and 21% of households had both. All of the recovered cultures as well as the community sequencing results revealed Thermus scotoductus to be the dominant thermophile in domestic water heaters, with a minority of water heaters also containing Meiothermus species and a few containing Aquificae. Sequence distance comparisons show that allopatric speciation does not appear to be a strong control on T. scotoductus distribution. Our results demonstrate that thermophilic organisms are widespread in hot tap water, and that Thermus scotoductus preferentially colonizes water heaters at the expense of local environmental Thermus strains.",2019,23,10.1007/s00792-018-1066-z

The aim of this study was to understand the communality and differences in the microbiomes of various regions of the eye. Methods: Four ocular sites from different subject groups were assessed including the eyelid margin tissue from patients with lid abnormalities (n = 20), fornix and limbus conjunctival tissue from patients with pterygia (n = 23), ocular (conjunctival) surface swabs (n = 45) and facial skin swabs (n = 16). Microbial communities were analysed by extracting total DNA from samples and sequencing the 16S ribosomal(r) RNA gene using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Sequences were quality filtered, clustered into unique sequences (zOTUs) using the UNOISE pipeline in USEARCH and taxonomically classified using SILVA. Results: A difference in bacterial richness and diversity was found between sites (P < 0.001) and for age (P < 0.035) but not for sex (P > 0.05). There was a difference in bacterial community structure and composition between sites (P < 0.001). Bacterial distribution could be broadly classified into three groups - zOTUs resident on the skin and lid margin but with low abundances at other sites (Corynebacterium, Staphylococcus), zOTUs found mainly on the ocular surface (Acinetobacter, Aeribacillus) and zOTUs mostly present in the conjunctiva and lid margin (Pseudomonas). Conclusion: The microhabitats of the human eye (ocular surface, conjunctiva, lid margin and skin) have a distinct bacterial biogeography with some bacteria shared between multiple regions while other bacteria occupy a more confined niche .",2019,17,10.1016/j.jtos.2018.11.005

Amazonian aquatic systems comprise a dynamic mosaic of heterogeneous habits but are understudied and there is limited information about the mechanisms that shape bacterial community composition (BCC). There is a consensus that environmental selection (species sorting) and dispersal processes (source-sink dynamics) act in concert to shape the composition of these communities, but the relative importance of each mechanism may vary dramatically through time and between systems. Applying 16S rRNA gene amplicon high-throughput sequencing, we studied factors and processes that modulate BCC in an Amazonian floodplain lake and used source-tracking models to trace the main dispersal sources of microorganisms in the whole floodplain system during a full hydrological cycle. Our source-tracking models indicated that dispersal processes were predominant, explaining most of the BCC variability throughout the study period. We observed more sources contributing to the sink community during the falling water than rising water period, when contributions from the Solimes River dominated. There was a clear seasonal pattern in BCC, closely related to environmental variables, suggesting that the successful establishment of dispersing bacteria also depends on environmental filtering that is linked to water flow. In summary, source-sink dynamics and species sorting were strongly affected by water exchange and connectivity with the main river that varied throughout the flood pulse cycle. Our results demonstrated the influence of lateral transport and temporal dynamics on BCC in Amazonian floodplain lakes that could ultimately impact regional carbon budgets and biogeochemical cycles.",2019,64,10.1111/fwb.13198

This study aims to investigate the impact of grape varieties and clones on grape berry surface bacterial microbiome from the same vineyard. Methods and Results High-throughput sequencing strategy was used to investigate the bacterial diversity and abundance on the grape surfaces of 12 clones belonging to six varieties grown in the same vineyard of Zhengzhou Fruit Research Institute in Henan Province. In total, 45 bacterial phyla and 933 genera were detected from all samples. Cyanobacteria, Proteobacteria and Firmicutes were the most abundant and prevalent phyla, while Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, Acidobacteria and Planctomycetes were grape clone specific phyla. The nonrank genus from phylum Cyanobacteria occupied 30-81% of grape clones from Italian Riesling (GRX), Cabernet Franc (PLZ), Pinot Blanc (BBN) and Riesling (LSL). Interestingly, Bacillus, Pseudomonas and Lactococcus were the only three prevalent genera found on all the clones. Furthermore, the predicted functional activities of grape surface bacterial communities varied according to the clones. Conclusions The present study revealed that in addition to the grape varieties, the variations in grape clone background may also affect the bacterial microbiome on grape surfaces which may ultimately determine their functional activities.

Therefore, understanding the factors that affect their diversity is important. We have analyzed fungal and bacterial communities associated with plant shoots, roots and soil over a 1 km(2) area in a semi-natural temperate grassland with 1-43 plant species per 0.1 m(2), to describe the relationships between plant and microbial diversity and to identify the drivers of bacterial and fungal community composition. Microbial community composition differed between shoots, roots and soil. While both fungal and bacterial species richness in shoots increased with plant species richness, no correlation was found between plant and microbial diversity in roots and soil. Chemistry was a significant predictor of bacterial and fungal community composition in soil as was also the spatial location of the sampled site. In this species-rich grassland, the effects of plants on the microbiome composition seemed to be restricted to the shoot-associated taxa; in contrast, the microbiomes of roots or soil were not affected. The results support our hypothesis that the effect of plants on the microbiome composition decreases from shoots to roots and soil.",2019,95,10.1093/femsec/fiy208

However, to be used effectively and reliably, more needs to be learned about the natural distribution patterns of microbial communities in soil. In this study we examine these patterns in detail, at local to regional scales (2 m-260 km), across an environmental gradient in three different soil types. Geographic location was found to be more important than soil type in determining the microbial community composition: communities from the same site but different soil types, although significantly different from each other, were still much more similar to each other than were communities from the same soil type but from different sites. At a local scale (25-1000m), distance-decay relationships were observed in all soil types: the farther apart two soil communities were located, even in the same soil type, the more they differed. At regional-scale distances (1-260 km), differences between communities did not increase with increased geographic distance between them, and the dominant factor determining the community profile was the physico-chemical environment, most notably annual precipitation (R-2 = 0.69), soil sodium (R-2 = 0.49) and soil ammonium (R-2 = 0.47) levels. We introduce a likelihood-ratio framework for quantitative evaluation of soil microbial DNA profile evidence in casework. In conclusion, these profiles, along with detailed knowledge of natural soil microbial biogeography, provide valuable forensic information on soil sample comparison and allow the determination of approximate source location on large (hundreds of km) spatial scales. Moreover, at small spatial scales it may enable pinpointing the source location of a sample to within at least 25 m, regardless of soil type and environmental conditions.",2019,38,10.1016/j.fsigen.2018.11.010

The diversity and abundance of soil microbes are influenced by biotic and edaphic factors such as plant communities and soil chemistry. Despite this general understanding, relatively few details are known about how soil microbial community structure responds to changing plant communities and soil chemistry associated with secondary forest succession. To address these gaps, we used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to investigate how diversity, composition and abundance of soil prokaryotic communities differed among five successional stages at two soil depths in a temperate forest, and then related these differences with soil properties. Oligotrophic prokaryotic taxa were more common in earlier successional stages, and community diversity declined at later forest successional stages. Prokaryotic diversity was consistently higher in topsoil than subsoil. Prokaryotic community composition varied with respect to soil organic matter (SOM) properties. The relative abundances of specific carbon (C) functional groups (e.g., aliphatic C groups, aromatic C groups and polysaccharides) revealed by mid-IR spectroscopy were strongly related with prokaryotic community composition. Overall, this study revealed that changes in soil prokaryotic community structure (diversity, composition and taxa abundance) paralleled changes in plant communities and soil chemistry associated with forest succession, and that these changes can be inferred through changes in SOM properties.",2019,128,10.1016/j.soilbio.2018.10.004

The prominence of Prochlorococcus across the environmental gradients of the open ocean is attributed to its extensive genetic diversity and flexible chlorophyll physiology, enabling light capture over a wide range of intensities. What remains unknown is the balance between temporal dynamics of genetic diversity and chlorophyll physiology in the ability of Prochlorococcus to respond to a variety of short (approximately 1 day) and longer (months to year) changes in the environment. Previous field research established depth-dependent Prochlorococcus single cell chlorophyll distributions in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre. Here, we examined whether the shifts in chlorophyll distributions correspond to changes in Prochlorococcus genetic diversity (i.e., ecotype-level community structure) or photoacclimation of stable communities over short time intervals. We report that community structure was relatively stable despite abrupt shifts in Prochlorococcus chlorophyll physiology, due to unexpected physiological plasticity of high-light adapted Prochlorococcus ecotypes. Through comparison with seasonal-scale changes, our data suggest that variability on daily scales triggers shifts in Prochlorococcus photoacclimation, while seasonal-scale dynamics trigger shifts in community structure. Together, these data highlight the importance of incorporating the process of photoacclimation and chlorophyll dynamics into interpretations of phytoplankton population dynamics from chlorophyll data as well as the importance of daily-scale variability to Prochlorococcus ecology.",2018,5,10.3389/fmars.2018.00488

The extent of their impact depends essentially on cell-survival rates during the process of aerosolization. A central factor for cell-survival is water availability prior to and upon aerosolization. Also, the ability of cells to successfully cope with stress induced by drying determines their chances of survival. In this study, we used the ice-nucleation active, plant pathogenic Pseudomonas syringae strain R10.79 as a model organism to investigate the effect of drying on cell survival. Two forms of drying were simulated: drying of cells in small droplets aerosolized from a wet environment by bubble bursting and drying of cells in large droplets deposited on a surface. For drying of cells both in aerosol and surface droplets, the relative humidity (RH) was varied in the range between 10 and 90%. The fraction of surviving cells was determined by live/dead staining followed by flow cytometry. We also evaluated the effect of salt concentration in the water droplets on the survival of drying cells by varying the ionic strength between 0 and 700 mM using NaCl and sea salt. For both aerosol and surface drying, cell survival increased with decreasing RH (p < 0.01), and for surface drying, survival was correlated with increasing salt concentration (p < 0.001). Imaging cells with TEM showed shrunk cytoplasm and cell wall damage for a large fraction of aerosolized cells. Ultimately, we observed a 10-fold higher fraction of surviving cells when dried as aerosol compared to when dried on a surface. We conclude that the conditions, under which cells dry, significantly affect their survival and thus their success to spread through the atmosphere and colonize new environments as well as their ability to affect atmospheric processes.",2018,9,10.3389/fmicb.2018.03086

In addition, knowledge of whether and how historical contingencies affect microbial distributions at small spatial scales is lacking. Here, we analyzed soil-borne microbial (bacterial, archaeal, and fungal) communities in 12 quadrat plots around the Fildes Region of King George Island, maritime Antarctica, and the communities were divided into two groups according to the soil elemental compositions and environmental attributes of Holocene raised beach and Tertiary volcanic stratigraphy. Prokaryotic communities of the two groups were well separated; the prokaryotic data were primarily correlated with soil elemental compositions and were secondly correlated with environmental attributes (e.g., soil pH, total organic carbon, NO3-, and vegetation coverage; Pearson test, r = 0.59 vs. 0.52, both P < 0.01). The relatively high abundance of P, S, Cl, and Br in Group 1 (Holocene raised beach site) was likely due to landform uplift. Lithophile-elements (Si, Al, Ca, Sr, Ti, V, and Fe) correlated with prokaryotic communities in Group 2 may have originated from weathering of Tertiary volcanic rock. No significant correlations were found between the fungal community distribution and both the soil elemental composition and environmental attributes in this study; however, Monte Carlo tests revealed that elements Sr and Ti, soil pH, sampling altitude, and moss and lichen species numbers had significant impacts on fungal communities. The elements and nutrients accumulated during the formation of different landforms influenced the development of soils, plant growth, and microbial communities, and this resulted in small-scale spatially heterogeneous biological distributions. These findings provide new evidence that geological evolutionary processes in the Fildes Region were crucial to its microbial community development, and the results highlight that microbial distribution patterns are the legacies of historical events at this small spatial scale. Based on this study, the ice-free regions in maritime Antarctica represent suitable research sites for studying the influence of geomorphological features on microbial distributions, and we envision the possibility of a site-specific landform assignment through the analysis of the soil prokaryotic community structure.",2018,9,10.3389/fmicb.2018.03065

In this study, we investigated the spatial distribution and community assembly of fungi in the bulk soil and rhizosphere of soybean collected from 43 sites across China using high-throughput sequencing. The alpha diversity of the rhizosphere was lower than that of bulk soil. The fungal community structures of the two soil compartments were distinct. Fungal communities in the rhizosphere had a steeper distance-decay relationship slope between sampled sites than those in bulk soil, suggesting a greater influence of historical processes ( geographical separation) in the rhizosphere. The relative importance of dispersal limitation and environmental filtering for the fungal community composition differed between bulk soil and rhizosphere. Sloan neutral model analysis suggested that niche-based processes dominated the assemblage of fungal communities in the two soil compartments, while neutral processes had a weaker influence in the rhizosphere than in bulk soil. Additionally, we analyzed the structures of abundant and rare fungal sub-communities in each soil compartment. Rare sub-communities were more strongly influenced by dispersal limitation than abundant sub-communities.

Severe perturbations can occur within these microbial communities during critical illness due to underlying diseases and clinical interventions, potentially influencing patient outcomes. We sought to profile the microbial composition of critically ill mechanically ventilated patients, and to determine whether microbial diversity is associated with illness severity and mortality.MethodsWe conducted a prospective, observational study of mechanically ventilated critically ill patients with a high incidence of pneumonia in 2 intensive care units (ICUs) in Hamilton, Canada, nested within a randomized trial for the prevention of healthcare-associated infections. The microbial profiles of specimens from 3 anatomical sites (respiratory, and upper and lower gastrointestinal tracts) were characterized using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing.ResultsWe collected 65 specimens from 34 ICU patients enrolled in the trial (29 endotracheal aspirates, 26 gastric aspirates and 10 stool specimens). Specimens were collected at a median time of 3days (lower respiratory tract and gastric aspirates; interquartile range [IQR] 2-4) and 6days (stool; IQR 4.25-6.75) following ICU admission. We observed a loss of biogeographical distinction between the lower respiratory tract and gastrointestinal tract microbiota during critical illness. Moreover, microbial diversity in the respiratory tract was inversely correlated with APACHE II score (r=-0.46, p=0.013) and was associated with hospital mortality (Median Shannon index: Discharged alive; 1.964 vs. Deceased; 1.348, p=0.045).ConclusionsThe composition of the host-associated microbial communities is severely perturbed during critical illness.

In this study, we discovered that the American White Pelicans (AWPE) at Great Salt Lake soak in the hypersaline brine and accumulate salt crystals (halite) on their feathers. We cultured halophilic archaea from AWPE feathers and halite crystals. The microorganisms isolated from the lakeshore crystals were restricted to two genera: Halorubrum and Haloarcula, however, archaea from the feathers were strictly Haloarcula. We compared partial DNA sequence of the 16S rRNA gene from our cultivars with that of similar strains in the GenBank database. To understand the biogeography of genetically similar halophilic archaea, we studied the geographical locations of the sampling sites of the closest-matched species.

Uncertainty remains, however, in what governs the relative contributions of different ecological processes. To help fill this knowledge gap, we test the general hypothesis that both initial state and degree of change in environmental conditions govern the relative contributions of different ecological assembly processes. To do so, we leveraged regional-scale nutrient and organic matter addition experiments and used soil organic matter (SOM) as a proxy of integrated soil environmental conditions. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that both the initial amount of SOM and the degree of change in SOM-in response to nutrient addition-influenced the relative contributions of different ecological assembly processes. These influences were most clearly observed at the regional scale, suggesting potential scale dependence. More specifically, nutrient additions homogenized bacterial community composition due to enhanced influences of homogenizing dispersal when SOM content was initially high. In contrast, nutrient additions led to divergence in community composition due to variable selection when initial SOM was low and/or when SOM increased significantly in response to nutrient additions. Our findings indicate important connections among initial conditions, degree of change in environmental variables and microbial community assembly processes that may influence ecosystem processes.

So far, the effects of high salinity on the most abundant marine photoautotrophic organism, Prochlorococcus, in marine oligotrophic environments, are mostly unknown. Here, we report the isolation of a new Prochlorococcus strain (RSP50) belonging to high-light (HL) clade II from the Red Sea, one of the warmest and most saline bodies of water in the global oceans. A comparative genomic analysis identified a set of 59 genes that were exclusive to RSP50 relative to currently available Prochlorococcus genomes, the majority of which (70%) encode for hypothetical proteins of unknown function. However, three of the unique genes encode for a complete pathway for the biosynthesis of the compatible solute glucosylglycerol, and are homologous to enzymes found in the sister lineage Synechococcus.

For this reason, it has been proposed as an analogue for Mars, presenting deleterious factors similar to those on the surface of that planet. We evaluated the survival of extremophilic UV-resistant yeasts isolated from a high-elevation area in the Atacama Desert under stratospheric conditions. As biological controls, intrinsically resistant Bacillus subtilis spores were used. Experiments were performed in two independent stratospheric balloon flights and with an environmental simulation chamber. The three following different conditions were evaluated: (i) desiccation, (ii) desiccation plus exposure to stratospheric low pressure and temperature, and (3) desiccation plus exposure to the full stratospheric environment (UV, low pressure, and temperature). Two strains, Naganishia (Cryptococcus) friedmannii 16LV2 and Exophiala sp. strain 15LV1, survived full exposures to the stratosphere in larger numbers than did B. subtilis spores. Holtermanniella watticus (also known as Holtermanniella wattica) 16LV1, however, suffered a substantial loss in viability upon desiccation and did not survive the stratospheric UV exposure. The remarkable resilience of N. friedmannii and Exophiala sp. 15LV1 under the extreme Mars-like conditions of the stratosphere confirms its potential as a eukaryotic model for astrobiology. Additionally, our results with N. friedmannii strengthen the recent hypothesis that yeasts belonging to the Naganishia genus are fit for aerial dispersion, which might account for the observed abundance of this species in high-elevation soils. IMPORTANCE Studies of eukaryotic microorganisms under conditions of astrobiological relevance, as well as the aerial dispersion potential of extremophilic yeasts, are still lacking in the literature compared to works with bacteria. Using stratospheric balloon flights and a simulation chamber, we demonstrate that yeasts isolated from an extreme environment are capable of surviving all stressors found in the stratosphere, including intense UV irradiation, scoring an even higher survival than B. subtilis spores. Notably, the yeast N. friedmannii, which displayed one of the highest tolerances to the stratospheric environment in the experiments, was recently proposed to be adapted to airborne transportation, although such a hypothesis had not yet been tested. Our results strengthen such an assumption and can help explain the observed distribution and ecology of this particular yeast species.",2018,84,10.1128/AEM.01942-18

Two types of Frankia lineages can be distinguished based on their ability to sporulate in planta. Spore-positive (Sp) strains are predominant on Alnus incana and Alnus viridis in highlands, while spore-negative (Sp-) strains are mainly associated with Alnus glutinosa in lowlands. Here, we investigated whether the Sp predominance in nodules is due to host selection of certain Frankia geno types from soil communities or the result of the ecological history of the alder stand soil, as well as the effect of the sporulation genotype on the ectomycorrhizal (ECM) communities. Trapping experiments were conducted using A. glutinosa, A. incana, and A. viridis plantlets on 6 soils, differing in the alder species and the frequency of Sp nodules in the field. Higher diversity of Frankia spp. and variation in Sp frequencies were observed in the trapping than in the fields. Both indigenous and trapping species shape Frankia community structure in trapped nodules. Nodulation impediments were observed under several trapping conditions in Sp soils, supporting a narrower host range of Sp Frankia species. A. incana and A. viridis were able to associate equally with compatible Sp and Sp- strains in the greenhouse. Additionally, no host shift was observed for Alnus-specific ECM, and the sporulation genotype of Frankia spp. defined the ECM communities on the host roots. The symbiotic association is likely determined by the host range, the soil history, and the type of in planta Frankia species. These results provide an insight into the biogeographical drivers of alder symbionts in the Holarctic region. IMPORTANCE Most Frankia-actinorhiza plant symbioses are capable of high rates of nitrogen fixation comparable to those found on legumes. Yet, our understanding of the ecology and distribution of Frankia spp. is still very limited. Several studies have focused on the distribution patterns of Frankia spp., demonstrating a combination of host and pedoclimatic parameters in their biogeography. However, very few have considered the in planta sporulation form of the strain, although it is a unique feature among all symbiotic plant-associated microbes. Compared with Sp- Frankia strains, Sp strains would be obligate symbionts that are highly dependent on the presence of a compatible host species and with lower efficiency in nitrogen fixation. Understanding the biogeographical drivers of Sp Frankia strains might help elucidate the ecological role of in planta sporulation and the extent to which this trait mediates host-partner interactions in the alder-Frankia-ECM fungal symbiosis.",2018,84,10.1128/AEM.01737-18

This process inoculates and enriches for halotolerant microorganisms in these reservoirs over time, resulting in a saline ecosystem that includes methane producing archaea. Here, we survey the biogeography of methanogens across unconventional reservoirs, and report that members of genus Methanohalophilus are recovered from every hydraulically fractured unconventional reservoir sampled by metagenomics. We provide the first genomic sequencing of three isolate genomes, as well as two metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs). Utilizing six other previously sequenced isolate genomes and MAGs, we perform comparative analysis of the 11 genomes representing this genus. This genomic investigation revealed distinctions between surface and subsurface derived genomes that are consistent with constraints encountered in each environment. Genotypic differences were also uncovered between isolate genomes recovered from the same well, suggesting niche partitioning among closely related strains. These genomic substrate utilization predictions were then confirmed by physiological investigation. Fine-scale microdiversity was observed in CRISPR-Cas systems of Methanohalophilus, with genomes from geographically distinct unconventional reservoirs sharing spacers targeting the same viral population.

Critically, Arctic soils are estimated to store over 1500 Pg of carbon and, thus, have the potential to generate positive feedback within the climate system. As the Arctic region is currently undergoing rapid change, the likelihood of faster release of greenhouse gases such as CO2, CH4 and N2O is increasing.

Interestingly, no consistent taxonomic or biogeographic predictors have been identified. However, an important lesson learned was that there are interactions among host plants, environmental factors, and characters of the pathogens. A logical extension of the predictivity project is to examine the dynamics of resistances when multiple biotic stresses are involved. In this study, we found that populations susceptible to a foliar feeding pest [Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say)] are resistant to a bacterial pathogen [Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum (Jones, 1901; Hauben et al. 1999)]. We propose that wounds caused by the insect pest allow the bacterial pathogen to gain entry and cause disease. This would lead to strong selection pressure for resistance to the bacterial pathogen. Consequently, when searching for traits of interest in germplasm collections, it is important to consider the complex biotic and abiotic environments in which the source populations evolved.",2018,65,10.1007/s10722-018-0682-x

Here, we examined latitudinal variation in the soil biota community associated with the invasive plant Alternanthera philoxeroides and its native congener A. sessilis, and the effects of soil biota community variation on these plants and the beetle Agasicles hygrophila. We characterized the soil bacterial and fungal communities and root-knot nematodes of plant rhizospheres collected from 22 degrees N to 36.6 degrees N in China. Soil biota community structure changed with latitude as a function of climate and soil properties. Root-knot nematode abundance and potential soil fungal pathogen diversity (classified with FUNGuild) decreased with latitude, apparently due to higher soil pH and lower temperatures. A greenhouse experiment and lab bioassay showed native plant mass, seed production, and mass of beetles fed native foliage increased with soil collection latitude. However, there were no latitudinal patterns for the invasive plant. These results suggest that invasive and native plants and, consequently, their herbivores have different responses to latitudinal changes in soil-borne enemies, potentially creating spatial variation in enemy release or biotic resistance. This highlights the importance of linking above- and below-ground multitrophic interactions to explore the role of soil biota in non-native plant invasions with a biogeographic approach.",2018,12,10.1038/s41396-018-0219-5

The biogeography of rhizobia has been well investigated, but little is known about the spatial distribution and community assemblage of NRE. By using high-throughput sequencing, we compared biogeographic patterns of rhizobial and non-rhizobial subcommunities and investigated their bacterial co-occurrence patterns in nodules collected from 50 soybean fields across China. Dispersal probability was lower in NRE than in rhizobia, as revealed by a significant distance-decay relationship found in NRE, but not in rhizobia, in addition to a significant occupancy-abundance relationship in the entire community. Rhizobial and NRE subcommunities were significantly influenced by different environmental and spatial variables. Moreover, the rhizobial subcommunities were grouped into Ensifer- and Bradyrhizobium-dominated clusters that were significantly related to soil pH. The non-rhizobial subcommunities were grouped into Proteobacteria-and Firmicutes-dominated clusters that were more influenced by climatic than by edaphic factors. These results demonstrated that rhizobial and non-rhizobial subcommunities are characterized by distinct biogeographic patterns. Network analysis showed rhizobia and NRE as separately grouped and uncorrelated with each other, suggesting they did not share niche space in soybean nodules. In sum, these results broaden our knowledge of how bacteria are distributed and assemble as a community in root nodules. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We hypothesized that, at the small-scale, co-location of degraders and pollutants in soils may be a prerequisite for efficient biodegradation of these chemicals. In non-co-localized micro-environments, however, diffusive and advective solute transport as well as active transport of microbial degraders towards their corresponding substrate may improve the accessibility of microbial substrates. The objective of this study was to test whether water flow can accelerate microbial pesticide degradation by facilitating the encounter of spatially separated pesticides and bacterial degraders at the millimeter scale. Combining natural and sterilized soil aggregates, we built soil cores with different spatial localizations of the pesticide 2,4-dichIorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and microbial degraders: (i) homogeneous distribution of microorganisms and 2,4-D throughout the soil core, (ii) co-localized microorganisms and 2,4-D in a mm(3) soil location, and iii) separated microorganisms and 2,4-D in two mm(3) soil locations spaced 1 cm apart. Following the fate of C-14 labelled 2,4-D (mineralization, extractable and non-extractable residues) as well as the abundance of bacterial 2,4-D degraders harboring the tfdA gene over an incubation period of 24 days, we observed decreased biodegradation of 2,4-D with increasing spatial separation between substrate and bacterial degraders. We found evidence that advection is a key process controlling the accessibility of 2,4-D and pesticide degraders. Advective solute transport induced leaching of about 50% of the initially applied 2,4-D regardless of initial spatial distribution patterns. Simultaneously, advective transport of 2,4-D and bacterial degraders triggered their re-encounter and compensated for the leaching-induced separation of initially co-localized micro-organisms and 2,4-D. This resulted in effective biodegradation of 2,4-D, comparable to the homogeneous treatment. Similarly, advective transport processes brought substrate and degraders into contact if both were initially separated. Thus, advection more effectively removed bioaccessibility limitations to pesticide degradation than diffusive transport alone. These results emphasize the importance of considering spatial microbial ecology as well as biogeophysics at the mm scale to better understand the fate of pesticides at larger scales in soil.",2018,127,10.1016/j.soilbio.2018.09.024

However, little is known about the environmental factors explaining this for soil methane-oxidising bacteria (or methanotrophs), which play an essential role in ecosystem functioning and climate regulation through mitigation of net CH4 emissions worldwide. This knowledge gap limits the inclusion of taxon-based information to improve predictions of climate change-simulation models. In this study, 697 soil samples were collected across Scotland and 62 climo-edaphic properties were analysed. Combined with a set of hybrid geostatistical modelling approaches, the aim of this study was to investigate the biogeographical distribution (pmoA gene relative abundance) of key methanotrophic operational taxonomic units named Terminal-Restriction Fragments (T-RFs) and of methanotrophic community structure. The main objectives were to: 1) identify major environmental drivers influencing the distribution and composition of methanotrophs; and 2) perform spatial modelling and mapping of soil methanotrophic community assemblage and distribution of those dominant T-RFs. Herein, it was hypothesised that the assemblage of methanotrophic community and distribution of key populations across various landscapes could be predicted using a range of climo-edaphic factors optimised for spatial, climate and terrain attributes. The findings presented here suggest that the distribution of methanotrophs is strongly linked to land use and some edaphic properties, predominantly soil moisture/rainfall, nutrients and metal ions. The hybrid geostatistical approach allowed for spatial prediction of methanotrophic T-RFs and community, and demonstrated a clear niche partitioning between dominant T-RFs. Overall, these results provide novel evidence that the distribution of methanotrophs could be explained and mapped in terms of niche partitioning and predicted at the regional scale. The findings of the present study have significance for the sustainable management of ecosystems and improvement of simulation models for better prediction of ecosystem functions under predicted global changes.",2018,127,10.1016/j.soilbio.2018.08.014

Near surface interactions between urban waterways and urban air are understudied but some level of interaction among these bacterial communities would be expected and may be relevant to understanding both urban air and water quality. To address this gap related to patterns of local air-water microbial exchange, we utilized next-generation sequencing of 16S rRNA genes from paired air and water samples collected from 3 urban waterfront sites and evaluated their relative bacterial diversity. Aerosol samples at all sites were significantly more diverse than water samples. Only 17-22% of each sites bacterial aerosol OTUs were present at every site. These shared aerosol OTUs included taxa associated with terrestrial systems (e.g., Bacillus), aquatic systems (e.g., Planktomarina) and sewage (e.g., Enterococcus). In fact, sewage-associated genera were detected in both aerosol and water samples, (e.g., Bifidobacterium, Blautia, and Faecalibacterium), demonstrating the widespread influence of similar pollution sources across these urban environments. However, the majority (50-61%) of the aerosol OTUs at each site were unique to that site, suggesting that local sources are an important influence on bioaerosols.

Here, we suggest the use of microbial mats as a model of study to reveal patterns that can illuminate the ecological processes underlying microbial dynamics in response to stress. We traced the responses to anthropogenic perturbation caused by water depletion in microbial mats from Cuatro Cienegas Basin (CCB), Mexico, by using a time-series spatially resolved analysis in a novel combination of three computational approaches. First, we implemented MEBS (Multi-genomic Entropy-Based Score) to evaluate the dynamics of major biogeochemical cycles across spatio-temporal scales with a single informative value. Second, we used robust Time Series-Ecological Networks (TS-ENs) to evaluate the total percentage of interactions at different taxonomic levels. Lastly, we utilized network motifs to characterize specific interaction patterns. Our results indicate that microbial mats from CCB contain an enormous taxonomic diversity with at least 100 phyla, mainly represented by members of the rare biosphere (RB). Statistical ecological analyses point out a clear involvement of anaerobic guilds related to sulfur and methane cycles during wet versus dry conditions, where we find an increase in fungi, photosynthetic, and halotolerant taxa. TS-ENs indicate that in wet conditions, there was an equilibrium between cooperation and competition (positive and negative relationships, respectively), while under dry conditions there is an over-representation of negative relationships. Furthermore, most of the keystone taxa of the TS-ENs at family level are members of the RB and the microbial mat core highlighting their crucial role within the community. Our results indicate that microbial mats are more robust to perturbation due to redundant functions that are likely shared among community members in the highly connected TS-ENs with density values close to one (approximate to 0.9). Finally, we provide evidence that suggests that a large taxonomic diversity where all community members interact with each other (low modularity), the presence of permanent of low-abundant taxa, and an increase in competition can be potential buffers against environmental disturbance in microbial mats.",2018,9,10.3389/fmicb.2018.02606

"Li, J; Shen, XZ",An improved neutral community model for temporal observations in microbial communities,ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,"Niche theory and neutral theory propose two alternative mechanisms for explaining the long-term coexistence of species in ecological communities. However, the true dynamic mechanisms of ecological communities likely fall in between these two theories of niches and neutrality. Thus, models reconciling the niche and neutral theories to interpret these mechanisms are of high significance. Using temporal observations of microbial communities, Ofiteru et al. (2010) demonstrated a version of the neutral community model that quantifies the contributions of neutral forces and environmental factors on the population dynamics of species in the community. They use a novel weighted least squares method to estimate the parameters. However, this method estimates compound parameters and the population size cannot be disentangled from the immigration rate, becoming computationally intractable when there are zero values existing in the temporal observations. In the current study, we suggest a new version of the neutral community model, modified from the work of Oficeru et al. that does not suffer from these limitations. We also provide a new method for estimating the parameters for our model, which can resolve the estimates of individual parameters.

However, it is not yet clear whether bacterial communities can rebound to their pre-disturbance levels. To shed light on this issue, we tracked the responses of bacterial communities during an extreme salinization-desalinization cycle.ResultsOur results showed that salinization-up process induced an ecological succession, shifting from a community dominated by Betaproteobacteria to Gammaproteobacteria. Within the desalinization-down process, taxon-specific recovery trajectories varied profoundly, with only Gammaproteobacteria returning to their initial levels, of which Alphaproteobacteria was the most prominent member. The -diversity indices gradually increased at oligosaline environment (0.03 to 3 parts per thousand) and subsequently decreased profoundly at hypersaline condition (10 parts per thousand to 90 parts per thousand). However, the indices did not return to pre-disturbance level along the previous trajectory observed during the desalinization. Approximately half of the original OTUs were not detected during desalinization, suggesting that the seed bank may be damaged by the hypersaline environment.

These holes are self-contained ecosystems that include abundant bacterial life within their sediment and liquid water, and have recently gained the attention of microbial ecologists looking to use cryoconite holes as natural microcosms to study microbial community assembly. Here, we explore the idea that cryoconite holes can be viewed as islands, in the same sense that an island in the ocean is an area of habitat surrounded by a barrier to entry. In the case of a classic oceanic island, the ocean is a barrier between islands, but in the case of cryoconite holes, the ocean is comprised of impermeable solid ice. We test two hypotheses, born out of island biogeographic theory, that can be readily applied to cryoconite hole bacteria. First, we ask to what extent the size of a cryoconite hole is related to the amount of bacterial diversity found within it. Second, we ask to what extent cryoconite holes exhibit distance decay of similarity, meaning that geographically close holes are expected to harbor similar bacterial communities, and distant holes are expected to harbor more different bacterial communities. To test the island size hypothesis, we measured the sizes of cryoconite holes on three glaciers in Antarcticas Taylor Valley and used DNA sequencing to measure diversity of bacterial communities within them. We found that for two of these glaciers, there is a strong relationship between hole size and bacterial phylogenetic diversity, supporting the idea that cryoconite holes on those glaciers are islands. The high biomass dispersing to the third glacier we measured could explain the lack of size-diversity relationship, remaining consistent with island biogeography. To test the distance decay of similarity hypothesis, we used DNA sequence data from several previous studies of cryoconite hole bacteria from across the world. Combined with our Taylor Valley data, those data showed that cryoconite holes have strong spatial structuring at scales of one to several hundred kilometers, also supporting the idea that these dirty holes on glaciers are really islands in the cryosphere.",2018,6,10.3389/fevo.2018.00180

We show that this endangered oasis can be a model for a lost world. The ancient niche of extreme unbalanced nutrient stoichiometry favoured survival of ancestral microorganisms. This extreme nutrient imbalance persisted due to environmental stability and low extinction rates, generating a diverse and unique bacterial community. Several endemic clades of Bacillus invaded the Cuatro Cienegas region in two geological times, the late Precambrian and the Jurassic.

Stream ecosystems are under high anthropogenic pressure; however, studies have only examined the response of stream communities across large scales over multiple generations. We studied the responses of leaf-associated microbial communities in streams within three European biogeographical regions to chemical stress in a microcosm experiment with multiple cycles of fungicide pollution and resource colonisation. Fungal community composition and the ecosystem function leaf decomposition were measured as response variables. Microbial leaf decomposition showed similar recovery times under environmental levels of fungicide exposure across regions. Initially, the decomposition declined (between 19 and 53%) under fungicide stress and recovered to control levels during the third cycle of pollution and colonisation. Although community composition and its stress response varied between regions, this suggests similar functional community adaptation towards fungicide stress overtime. Genetic, epigenetic and physiological adaptations, as well as species turnover, may have contributed to community adaptation but further studies are required to determine if and to which extent these mechanisms are operating.

Previous studies have reported that hydroxyapatite has been extensively used to immobilize soil heavy metals, and the grain sizes of amendments affect the bioavailability and geochemical stability of heavy metals. However, it is not clear how soil microbial diversity and community composition in these soils vary with the application of hydroxyapatite. A field study was conducted to determine the effect of different grain sizes of hydroxyapatite on Cu and Cd bioavailability and microbial community composition. Results showed that micro-hydroxyapatite (MAP), nanohydroxyapatite (NAP) and normal hydroxyapatite (AP) increased soil pH and decreased soil exchangeable acid and exchangeable Al. Compared with the control, MAP was the most efficient in decreasing the CaCl2-extractable Cu and Cd by 97.5 and 86.5%, respectively, and exchangeable Cu and Cd by 82.4% and 27.4%, respectively. The soil microbial community composition varied with the amendments of different sizes, and the soil bacterial diversity increased after the amendment applications. Analysis of the network structure showed that fewer operational taxonomic units were enriched or depleted between the MAP- and NAP-amended soils, which explained the similarity between the MAP- and NAP-amended soils. These results suggest that MAP may be the best material for amending heavy metal-contaminated soils when considering immobilization efficiency and soil biological characteristics.",2018,267,10.1016/j.agee.2018.08.017

Like for humans, dysbiosis of the plant-associated microbiota may be a co-causal agent in disease with still obscure eziology. In the last decades, the common reed Phragmites australis has been deeply studied for its disappearance from natural stands, but no clear causative agents have been identified and no laboratory models of such reed die-back syndrome (RDBS) have been developed. In this study, we try to shed light on the RDBS, by comparing the rhizosphere microbiota of five Italian P. australis populations with different degrees of decline. Results obtained showed a biogeographical meaningful pattern of rhizosphere microbiota, coupled with an impact of RDBS. Obtained data allowed to construct a two-steps predictive model which enabled the prediction of the plant health status from the microbiota taxonomic composition, independently from their geographic location. In conclusion, this study represents one of the first overviews that statistically links RDBS to alteration of rhizosphere microbiota and suggests a model for the analysis of plant-bacteria relationships in nature.

However, it remains unclear how microbial community diversity and their eco-functions are affected by anthropogenic disturbances rather than natural environmental changes. Here, we explored sediment microbial functional genes dynamics and community interaction networks in Hangzhou Bay (HZB), one of the most severely polluted bays on Chinas eastern coast. The results indicated key microbial functional gene categories, including N, P, S, and aromatic compound metabolism, and stress response, displayed significant spatial dynamics along environmental gradients. Sensitive feedbacks of key functional gene categories to N and P pollutants demonstrated potential impacts of human-induced seawater pollutants to microbial functional capacity. Seawater ammonia and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) was identified as primary drivers in selecting adaptive populations and varying community composition. Network analysis revealed distinct modules that were stimulated in inner or outer bay. Importantly, the network keystone species, which played a fundamental role in community interactions, were strongly affected by N-pollutants.

In particular, El Rincon coastal area and the adjacent shelf fronts (38.5-42 degrees S, 58.5-62 degrees W) comprise diverse habitats and hold species of economic and ecological value. So far, studies of the microbial community present at the base of the food web remain scarce. Here, we describe the late winter plankton (5-200 mu m) structure in terms of abundance, biomass, species composition, functional groups, and phycotoxin profiles in surface waters of El Rincon in September 2015. Diatoms are the most abundant and the largest contributors to carbon biomass at most stations. They dominated the coastal and inner-shelf (depths <50 m), while dinoflagellates and small flagellates (<15 mu m) dominated offshore at the middle-shelf waters (depth similar to 100 m). In addition, large (> 20 mu m) heterotrophic protists such as various ciliates and dinoflagellates species were more abundant offshore. Scanning of phycotoxins disclosed that paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) toxins were dominated by gonyautoxins-1/4 (GTX1/4), whereas lipophilic toxins were detected in low abundance, for example, domoic acid (DA). However, a bloom of Pseudo-nitzschia spp. (up to 3.6 x 10(5) cells L-1) was detected at inner-shelf stations. Pectenotoxin-2 (PTX-2) and 13-desmethyl spirolide C (SPX-1) were the most abundant in the field. The PTX-2 cooccurred with Dinophysis spp., mainly D. tnpos, while SPX-1 dominated at middle-shelf stations, where cells of Alexandrium catenella (1 strain) and A. ostenfeldii (3 strains) were isolated. The quantitative PSP profiles of the Alexandrium strains differed significantly from the in situ profiles. Moreover, the three A. ostenfeldii strains produced PSP and additionally, five novel spirolides. Phylogenetic analyses of these newly isolated strains from the South Atlantic revealed a new ribotype group, suggesting a biogeographical distinction in the population.

Pathogens have to exquisitely monitor the biogeography of the gastrointestinal tract to find a suitable niche for colonization. To dissect the important metabolic pathways that influence virulence of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC), we conducted a highthroughput screen. We generated a dataset of regulatory pathways that control EHEC virulence expression under anaerobic conditions. This unraveled that the cysteine-responsive regulator, CutR, converges with the YhaO serine import pump and the fatty acid metabolism regulator FadR to optimally control virulence expression in EHEC. CutR activates expression of YhaO to increase activity of the YhaJ transcription factor that has been previously shown to directly activate the EHEC virulence genes. CutR enhances FadL, which is a pump for fatty acids that represses inhibition of virulence expression by FadR, unmasking a feedback mechanism responsive to metabolite fluctuations. Moreover, CutR and FadR also augment murine infection by Citrobacter rodentium, which is a murine pathogen extensively employed as a surrogate animal model for EHEC. This high-throughput approach proved to be a powerful tool tomap the web of cellular circuits that allows an enteric pathogen to monitor the gut environment and adjust the levels of expression of its virulence repertoire toward successful infection of the host.",2018,115,10.1073/pnas.1813451115

Previous studies have placed the ancestral population of the organism in Australia with a single lineage disseminated to Southeast Asia. We have previously characterized B. pseudomallei isolates from New Guinea and the Torres Strait archipelago; remote regions that share paleogeographic ties with Australia. These studies identified regional biogeographical boundaries. In this study, we utilize whole-genome sequencing to reconstruct ancient evolutionary relationships and ascertain correlations between paleogeography and present-day distribution of this bacterium in Australasia. Our results indicate that B. pseudomallei from New Guinea fall into a single Glade within the Australian population. Furthermore, clades from New Guinea are region-specific; an observation possibly linked to limited recent anthropogenic influence in comparison to mainland Australia and Southeast Asia. Isolates from the Torres Strait archipelago were distinct yet scattered among those from mainland Australia. These results provide evidence that the New Guinean and Torres Strait lineages may be remnants of an ancient portion of the Australian population. Rising sea levels isolated New Guinea and the Torres Strait Islands from each other and the Australian mainland, and may have allowed long-term isolated evolution of these lineages, providing support for a theory of microbial biogeography congruent with that of macro flora and fauna.

"Paver, SF; Muratore, D; Newton, RJ; Coleman, ML",Reevaluating the Salty Divide: Phylogenetic Specificity of Transitions between Marine and Freshwater Systems,MSYSTEMS,"Marine and freshwater microbial communities are phylogenetically distinct, and transitions between habitat types are thought to be infrequent. We compared the phylogenetic diversity of marine and freshwater microorganisms and identified specific lineages exhibiting notably high or low similarity between marine and freshwater ecosystems using a meta-analysis of 16S rRNA gene tag-sequencing data sets. As expected, marine and freshwater microbial communities differed in the relative abundance of major phyla and contained habitat-specific lineages. At the same time, and contrary to expectations, many shared taxa were observed in both habitats. Based on several metrics, we found that Gammaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Betaproteobacteria contained the highest number of closely related marine and freshwater sequences, suggesting comparatively recent habitat transitions in these groups. Using the abundant alphaproteobacterial group SAR11 as an example, we found evidence that new lineages, beyond the recognized LD12 Glade, are detected in freshwater at low but reproducible abundances; this evidence extends beyond the 16S rRNA locus to core genes throughout the genome. Our results suggest that shared taxa are numerous, but tend to occur sporadically and at low relative abundance in one habitat type, leading to an underestimation of transition frequency between marine and freshwater habitats. Rare taxa with abundances near or below detection, including lineages that appear to have crossed the salty divide relatively recently, may possess adaptations enabling them to exploit opportunities for niche expansion when environments are disturbed or conditions change. IMPORTANCE The distribution of microbial diversity across environments yields insight into processes that create and maintain this diversity as well as potential to infer how communities will respond to future environmental changes. We integrated data sets from dozens of freshwater lake and marine samples to compare diversity across open water habitats differing in salinity. Our novel combination of sequence-based approaches revealed lineages that likely experienced a recent transition across habitat types. These taxa are promising targets for studying physiological constraints on salinity tolerance. Our findings contribute to understanding the ecological and evolutionary controls on microbial distributions, and open up new questions regarding the plasticity and adaptability of particular lineages.",2018,3,10.1128/mSystems.00232-18

We sought to determine the taxonomic bacterial biogeography of the upper GI tract, including different sites within the human stomach (cardia, corpus, and antrum), adjacent upstream (esophagus) and downstream (duodenum) locations, and luminal contents (aspirate), as well as whole-stomach samples from mice and gerbils. Qualitative and quantitative DNA- and RNA-based taxonomic microbiota analyses were combined to study the relationship of relative and absolute bacterial abundances and transcriptionally active bacterial microbiota components in the stomach of humans and mice. Stomach microbiota compositions resembled those of esophagus and duodenum. However, along the descending GI tract, the relative abundances of specific oropharyngeal commensals decreased (Streptococcus) or increased (Rothia mucilaginosa, Porphyromonas, and Lachnospiraceae). Furthermore, the compositional similarity (weighted UniFrac) between stomach aspirates and esophageal biopsy samples increased with gastric Streptococcus relative abundance. In both human aspirate and mouse stomach samples, Firmicutes were more abundant among transcriptionally active bacteria than Bacteroidetes. The relative abundance of Firmicutes in the stomach was negatively correlated and that of Bacteroidetes was positively correlated with absolute bacterial abundance, suggesting a disproportionate increase of Bacteroidetes over Firmicutes at higher bacterial densities. Human, mouse, and gerbil stomach samples showed similarities at higher taxonomic levels but differences at lower taxonomic levels. Our findings suggest selective enrichment and depletion of specific bacterial taxa in the stomach and Firmicutes being transcriptionally more active than Bacteroidetes that increase in relative abundance with total bacterial load. IMPORTANCE Clinical stomach interventions, such as acid inhibition or bypass surgery, have been linked to fecal microbiota alterations. We demonstrate that the stomach microbiota largely overlaps those of adjacent gastrointestinal locations and identify gradual decreases and increases in the relative abundances of specific bacteria within the stomach, suggesting selective enrichment and depletion. Moreover, similarities between stomach and esophagus samples are proportional to the concentrations of Streptococcus (Firmicutes) in the stomach. The relative abundance of Firmicutes in the stomach, compared to that of Bacteroidetes, is increased in RNA relative to DNA, indicating higher transcriptional activity. Moreover, increased absolute bacterial loads are associated with decreased relative abundance of Firmicutes and higher relative abundance of Bacteroidetes. Our findings characterize the stomach microbiota as influenced by Bacteroidetes influx against a background of transcriptionally more active Firmicutes. Human, mouse, and gerbil stomach microbiotas differ at lower taxonomic levels, which might affect the utility of these model organisms.",2018,3,10.1128/mSystems.00262-18

In addition, distant locations may also lead to biogeographical patterns of microbial communities. Here, we used an undisturbed salt marsh chronosequence spanning over a century of ecosystem development to investigate changes in the community composition and abundance of a set of nitrogen-cycling genes. Specifically, we targeted genes of diazotrophs and ammonia oxidizers associated with the bulk and rhizosphere soil of the plant species Limonium vulgare. Samples were collected across five distinct successional stages of the chronosequence (ranging from 5 to 105years) at two time-points. Our results indicate that soil variables such as sand:silt:clay % content and pH strongly relates to the abundance of N-cycling genes in the bulk soil. However, in the rhizosphere samples, the abundance of ammonia-oxidizing organisms (both bacteria and archaea, AOB and AOA, respectively) was relatively constant across most of the successional stages, albeit displaying seasonal variation. This result indicates a potentially stronger control of plant host (rather than soil) on the abundance of these organisms. Interestingly, the plant host did not have a significant effect on the composition of AOA and AOB communities, being mostly divergent according to soil successional stages. The abundance of diazotrophic communities in rhizosphere samples was more affected by seasonality than those of bulk soil. Moreover, the abundance pattern of diazotrophs in the rhizosphere related to the systematic increase of plant biomass and soil organic matter along the successional gradient. These results suggest a potential season-dependent regulation of diazotrophs exerted by the plant host. Overall, this study contributes to a better understanding of how the natural formation of a soil and host plants influence the compositional and abundance changes of nitrogen-cycling genes in bulk and rhizosphere soil microhabitats.",2018,111,10.1007/s10482-018-1098-5

While highly diverse fungi have been discovered in these marine systems, still, little is known about their seasonality and associated drivers in coastal waters. Here, we examined fungal communities over 3 years of weekly sampling at a dynamic, temperate coastal site (Pivers Island Coastal Observatory [PICO], Beaufort, NC, USA). Fungal 18S rRNA gene abundance, operational taxonomic unit (OTU) richness, and Shannons diversity index values exhibited prominent seasonality. Fungal 18S rRNA gene copies peaked in abundance during the summer and fall, with positive correlations with chlorophyll a, SiO4, and oxygen saturation. Diversity (measured using internal transcribed spacer [ITS] libraries) was highest during winter and lowest during summer; it was linked to temperature, pH, chlorophyll a, insolation, salinity, and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). Fungal communities derived from ITS libraries were dominated throughout the year by Ascomycota, with contributions from Basidiomycota, Chytridiomycota, and Mucoromycotina, and their seasonal patterns linked to water temperature, light, and the carbonate system. Network analysis revealed that while cooccurrence and exclusion existed within fungus networks, exclusion dominated the fungus-and-phytoplankton network, in contrast with reported pathogenic and nutritional interactions between marine phytoplankton and fungi. Compared with the seasonality of bacterial communities in the same samples, the timing, extent, and associated environmental variables for fungi community are unique. These results highlight the fungal seasonal dynamics in coastal water and improve our understanding of the ecology of planktonic fungi. IMPORTANCE Coastal fungal dynamics were long assumed to be due to terrestrial inputs; here, a high-resolution time series reveals strong, repeating annual patterns linked to in situ environmental conditions, arguing for a resident coastal fungal community shaped by environmental factors. These seasonal patterns do, however, differ from those observed in the bacterioplankton at the same site; e.g., fungal diversity peaks in winter, whereas bacterial diversity maxima occur in the spring and fall. While the dynamics of these communities are linked to water temperature and insolation, fungi are also influenced by the carbonate system (pH and DIC). As both fungi and heterotrophic bacteria are thought to be key organic-material metabolizers, differences in their environmental drivers may offer clues as to which group dominates secondary production at this dynamic site. Overall, this study suggests the unique ecological roles of mycoplankton and their potentially broad niche complementarities to other microbial groups in the coastal ocean.",2018,84,10.1128/AEM.00967-18

In some instances, fermented foods provide a rich source of the beneficial microbial communities that could promote gastrointestinal health. The indigenous microbiota that colonize fermentation facilities may impact food quality, food safety, and spoilage risks and maintain the nutritive value of the product. Here, microbiomes within sauerkraut production facilities were profiled to characterize variance across surfaces and to determine the sources of these bacteria. Accordingly, we used high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene in combination with whole-genome shotgun analyses to explore biogeographical patterns of microbial diversity and assembly within the production facility. Our results indicate that raw cabbage and vegetable handling surfaces exhibit more similar microbiomes relative to the fermentation room, processing area, and dry storage surfaces. We identified biomarker bacterial phyla and families that are likely to originate from the raw cabbage and vegetable handling surfaces. Raw cabbage was identified as the main source of bacteria to seed the facility, with human handling contributing a minor source of inoculation. Leuconostoc and Lactobacillaceoe dominated all surfaces where spontaneous fermentation occurs, as these taxa are associated with the process. Wall, floor, ceiling, and barrel surfaces host unique microbial signatures. This study demonstrates that diverse bacterial communities are widely distributed within the production facility and that these communities assemble nonrandomly, depending on the surface type. IMPORTANCE Fermented vegetables play a major role in global food systems and are widely consumed by various global cultures. In this study, we investigated an industrial facility that produces spontaneous fermented sauerkraut without the aid of starter cultures. This provides a unique system to explore and track the origins of an in-house microbiome in an industrial environment. Raw vegetables and the surfaces on which they are handled were identified as the likely source of bacterial communities rather than human contamination. As fermented vegetables increase in popularity on a global scale, understanding their production environment may help maintain quality and safety goals.",2018,84,10.1128/AEM.01680-18

This problem is reduced to determining whether two soil samples test and control have the same origin or source. Here, we propose an algorithm which copes with this problem based on 16S rRNA gene libraries of test and control soil samples and does not rely on OTU clustering. The algorithm first extracts the Library-SPECific sets of sequences (LSPECs) for alternative control libraries and then quantifies signals of LSPECs in a test library. The heavy use of the suffix array approach for sequence comparison accelerates the algorithm significantly. To evaluate the performance of the algorithm, we collected a control set of 29 soil samples and created two test sets (real and simulated), containing mixed, contaminated and extremely small single-source soil samples (last samples resemble forensics probes). We then carried out 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing of total soil DNA isolated from both test and control soil samples. The algorithm successfully identified the origin of all single source soil samples and the compositions of mixed and even low/highly contaminated samples. The algorithm also demonstrated robustness to the increase in control set size from 9 to 29. We believe the proposed algorithm is suitable for identification problems with various degrees of complexity and is flexible enough to manage other molecular markers and microbiological samples from different non-soil sources.",2018,94,10.1016/j.ecolind.2018.06.060

Surprisingly, coordinated patterns in plant, bacterial, and fungal diversity on tropical mountains have not yet been observed, despite the central role of soil microorganisms in terrestrial biogeochemistry and ecology. We studied an Andean transect traversing 3.5 km in elevation to test whether the species diversity and composition of tropical forest plants, soil bacteria, and fungi follow similar biogeographical patterns with shared environmental drivers. We found coordinated changes with elevation in all three groups: species richness declined as elevation increased, and the compositional dissimilarity among communities increased with increased separation in elevation, although changes in plant diversity were larger than in bacteria and fungi. Temperature was the dominant driver of these diversity gradients, with weak influences of edaphic properties, including soil pH. The gradients in microbial diversity were strongly correlated with the activities of enzymes involved in organic matter cycling, and were accompanied by a transition in microbial traits towards slower-growing, oligotrophic taxa at higher elevations. We provide the first evidence of coordinated temperature-driven patterns in the diversity and distribution of three major biotic groups in tropical ecosystems: soil bacteria, fungi, and plants. These findings suggest that interrelated and fundamental patterns of plant and microbial communities with shared environmental drivers occur across landscape scales. These patterns are revealed where soil pH is relatively constant, and have implications for tropical forest communities under future climate change.",2018,99,10.1002/ecy.2482

Smoke from global biomass burning has had significant and widespread ecological and human health consequences, but the living component of smoke has received little attention. Microbes aerosolized and transported by wildland fire may have profound effects on atmospheric and environmental factors, acting as nuclei for ice condensation, transporting pathogens or symbionts, and otherwise influencing ecosystems and human populations downwind. The potential for smoke to aerosolize and transport viable microbes is a virtually blank piece of the microbial biogeography puzzle with far-reaching implications. This study characterized the aerosolization of viable microbes via wildland fire smoke from burns in contrasting coniferous forests. Seventy aerosolized microbial morphotypes were recovered, and of these, a subset was identified using DNA analysis which revealed both pathogenic and non-pathogenic fungal species. Overall microbial colony-forming units decreased with increasing distance from smoke source, driven by bacterial abundance. Organisms were more abundant in smoke derived from mechanically treated fuels than intact forest floors and were most abundant in smoke from a dry, biennially burned Pinus palustris sandhill forest in Florida. Our findings of smoke-transported viable microbes have implications for ecosystem restoration/conservation, global biodiversity, meteorology, and human health.",2018,9,10.1002/ecs2.2507

This premise remains challenging to test, however, as it requires quantifying the traits of closely related soil bacteria and relating these traits to bacterial abundances and geographic distributions. Here, we sought to investigate whether the widespread soil taxon Curtobacterium consists of multiple coexisting ecotypes with differential geographic distributions. We isolated Curtobacterium strains from six sites along a climate gradient and assayed four functional traits that may contribute to niche partitioning in leaf litter, the top layer of soil. Our results revealed that cultured isolates separated into fine-scale genetic clusters that reflected distinct suites of phenotypic traits, denoting the existence of multiple ecotypes. We then quantified the distribution of Curtobacterium by analysing metagenomic data collected across the gradient over 18 months. Six abundant ecotypes were observed with differential abundances along the gradient, suggesting fine-scale niche partitioning. However, we could not clearly explain observed geographic distributions of ecotypes by relating their traits to environmental variables. Thus, while we can resolve soil bacterial ecotypes, the traits delineating their distinct niches in the environment remain unclear.",2018,20,10.1111/1462-2920.14405

The prokaryotic communities are considered as one of the best indicators of the water quality. However, there are significant gaps in understanding the ecological processes that shape the composition and function of prokaryotic communities in the urban water ecosystems. Here, we investigated the biogeographic distribution of prokaryotic assemblages in water environments including landscape ponds, drinking water reservoirs, influents (IFs) and effluents (EFs) of wastewater treatment plants of a coastal city (Xiamen), China, by using 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing. Our results indicated that the ponds had higher alpha-diversity of prokaryotic communities than those in the reservoirs, while there were significant variations in the community compositions among ponds, reservoirs, IFs and EFs. Moreover, ponds harbored a significantly higher proportion of sewage- and fecal-indicator taxa than those in the reservoirs, suggesting the occurrence of exogenous pollution in the urban ponds. Null model analysis revealed that dispersal limitation was the main ecological processes resulting in the divergence of prokaryotic community compositions between ponds and other environments, while dispersal limitation and variable selection played an essential role in the formation of unique prokaryotic assemblages in the reservoirs. Function predication analysis demonstrated that the ponds shared more similar functional profiles with IFs or EFs (e.g., chemoheterotrophy, fermentation, chlorate reducers, nitrate reduction and respiration) than the reservoirs, whereas dominance of photoautotrophy was observed in the reservoirs. Overall, this study provides a profound insight of the ecological mechanisms underlying the responses of prokaryotic communities in the urban landscape ponds to the anthropogenic disturbances.

Therefore, hypersaline systems have attracted much attention in recent years. In this study, we investigated the protistan diversity and community composition in two natural salt evaporation ponds (27-30% salinity) located in an ancient volcanic crater on the Cape Verde island Sal using high-throughput DNA sequencing. Our study revealed a broad range of protistan taxa and a high taxonomic diversity within the Ciliophora, Dinophyceae, and Chlorophyta. We detected a total of 23 Dinophyceae families, although Dinophyceae were generally considered to be only this diverse in aquatic environments of less than 10% salinity. Moreover, we uncovered a high degree of genetic novelty in this habitat. The mean similarity of all detected OTUs to previously described sequences was only 93.6%. These findings strongly dispute the traditional view that extreme hypersaline environments generally maintain low protistan diversity. A meta-analysis covering our and previously published data from other inland and coastal salt ponds clearly showed that our samples clustered according to salinity and not biogeography.

While originally constrained by a lack of appropriate analytical tools and sequencing depth, new technologies and computational and statistical algorithms have been developed to handle highly dimensional, next-generation sequencing datasets. Both these tools allow for the robust analysis of structural and distributional patterns of microbiota essential for the understanding of microbial ecology and biogeography.

Differences between niches occupied by each taxon were evaluated using background similarity tests. All predictions showed significant ability to anticipate test points. The null hypotheses of niche similarity were rejected in all background similarity tests comparing the niches among the three species. This article provides the first quantitative assessment of environmental conditions associated with three species of ciliates and a first estimate of their spatial distributions in the North Atlantic, which can serve as a benchmark against which to document distributional shifts. These species follow consistent, predictable patterns related to climate and environmental biochemistry; the importance of climatic conditions as regards protist distributions is noteworthy considering the effects of global climate change.",2018,63,10.1002/lno.11003

However, many large rivers worldwide are suffering from dam regulation. Increasing attention has been paid to bacterioplankton communities since they are highly responsive to river alterations and may influence biogeochemical processes. Here, a comprehensive study was conducted in the highly regulated Lancang-Mekong River Basin to address the question of how bacterioplankton communities respond to cascade damming. The results showed that dam constructions increased nutrient concentrations and threatened water quality in cascade reservoirs. Bacterioplankton cell abundance was reduced by damming, and alpha-diversity was inhibited in cascade reservoirs. Fortunately, however, river ecosystems were resilient after the remarkable disturbance caused by damming. Moreover, bacterioplankton community composition was significantly altered by cascade dams, including a shift in the dominant phylum from r-strategists to k-strategists. Meanwhile, according to GeoChip analysis, the functional composition of bacterioplankton was less affected than taxonomic composition. In addition, geographic and environmental features both followed a distance-decay relationship with community and functional composition, but the local environment condition was the dominant driver in the Lancang River. Therefore, the impoundments of cascade dams had significant impacts on bacterioplankton communities and more attention should be paid to the potential ecological consequences of river regulation.",2018,27,10.1111/mec.14870
"Leventhal, GE; Boix, C; Kuechler, U; Enke, TN; Sliwerska, E; Holliger, C; Cordero, OX",Strain-level diversity drives alternative community types in millimetre-scale granular biofilms,NATURE MICROBIOLOGY,"Microbial communities are often highly diverse in their composition, both at a coarse-grained taxonomic level, such as genus, and at a highly resolved level, such as strains, within species. This variability can be driven by either extrinsic factors such as temperature and or by intrinsic ones, for example demographic fluctuations or ecological interactions. The relative contributions of these factors and the taxonomic level at which they influence community composition remain poorly understood, in part because of the difficulty in identifying true community replicates assembled under the same environmental parameters. Here, we address this problem using an activated granular sludge reactor in which millimetre-scale biofilm granules represent true community replicates. Differences in composition are then expected to be driven primarily by biotic factors. Using 142 shotgun metagenomes of single biofilm granules we found that, at the commonly used genus-level resolution, community replicates varied much more in their composition than would be expected from neutral assembly processes. This variation did not translate into any clear partitioning into discrete community types, that is, distinct compositional states, such as enterotypes in the human gut. However, a strong partition into community types did emerge at the strain level for the dominant organism: genotypes of Candidatus Accumulibacter that coexisted in the metacommunity (the reactor) excluded each other within community replicates (granules). Individual granule communities maintained a significant lineage structure, whereby the strain phylogeny of Accumulibacter correlated with the overall composition of the community, indicating a high potential for co-diversification among species and communities. Our results suggest that due to the high functional redundancy and competition between close relatives, alternative community types are most probably observed at the level of recently differentiated genotypes but not at higher orders of genetic resolution.",2018,3,10.1038/s41564-018-0242-3

It can differentially influence mitochondrial bioenergetics, retrograde signalling to the nuclear genome, and anterograde signalling to mitochondria. All these interactions have the potential to alter the frequencies of mtDNA haplotypes (mitotypes) in nature and may impact human health. In a model laboratory system, we fed four diets varying in Protein: Carbohydrate (P:C) ratio (1:2, 1:4, 1:8 and 1:16 P:C) to four homoplasmic Drosophila melanogaster mitotypes (nuclear genome standardised) and assayed their frequency in population cages. When fed a high protein 1:2 P:C diet, the frequency of flies harbouring Alstonville mtDNA increased. In contrast, when fed the high carbohydrate 1:16 P:C food the incidence of flies harbouring Dahomey mtDNA increased. This result, driven by differences in larval development, was generalisable to the replacement of the laboratory diet with fruits having high and low P:C ratios, perturbation of the nuclear genome and changes to the microbiome. Structural modelling and cellular assays suggested a V161L mutation in the ND4 subunit of complex I of Dahomey mtDNA was mildly deleterious, reduced mitochondrial functions, increased oxidative stress and resulted in an increase in larval development time on the 1:2 P:C diet. The 1:16 P:C diet triggered a cascade of changes in both mitotypes. In Dahomey larvae, increased feeding fuelled increased beta-oxidation and the partial bypass of the complex I mutation. Conversely, Alstonville larvae upregulated genes involved with oxidative phosphorylation, increased glycogen metabolism and they were more physically active. We hypothesise that the increased physical activity diverted energy from growth and cell division and thereby slowed development. These data further question the use of mtDNA as an assumed neutral marker in evolutionary and population genetic studies. Moreover, if humans respond similarly, we posit that individuals with specific mtDNA variations may differentially metabolise carbohydrates, which has implications for a variety of diseases including cardiovascular disease, obesity, and perhaps Parkinsons Disease.",2018,14,10.1371/journal.pgen.1007735

However, the effect of slope aspect on arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, a group of functionally important root-associated microorganisms, remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated AM fungal communities in an alpine ecosystem on a northwest-facing slope (NS) and a southeast-facing slope (SS) along a steep environmental gradient. Ecological processes structuring the fungal communities were inferred according to phylogenetic patterns and species abundance distributions. Thirty-two distinct AM fungal virtual taxa (VTs) were identified, predominantly belonging to the genus Glomus. The change of slope aspect from SS to NS recorded a significant decline in AM fungal richness, resulting in a marked loss of Glomus VTs and the dominance of Rhizophagus. Moreover, both taxonomic and phylogenetic composition of AM fungal communities significantly varied between the two slope aspects, this being largely driven by niche partitioning based on microclimate, soil pH and plant species composition. The influence of geographical distance was negligible. AM fungal communities were phylogenetically clustered on SS and random on NS, suggesting that the central process structuring communities shifted from a niche-dominated filter to the combination of competitive exclusion and a niche filter. Similarly, AM fungal species abundance distribution showed the best fit with the Lognormal model on SS and the Zipf-Mandelbrot model on NS, indicating that community dynamics on both slopes were also in accordance with niche-based mechanisms.",2018,126,10.1016/j.soilbio.2018.08.016

We assessed the BC composition of a littoral and two pelagic habitats (euphotic zone and hypolimnion) of Lake Tovel monthly from April 2014 to May 2017 by high-throughput sequencing of the V3-V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene. The three habitats differed in temperature, light, oxygen and hydrology. In particular, the littoral was the most hydrologically unstable because it receives most of the lake inflow, the hypolimnion was the most stable because of its hydrologically sheltered position, and the pelagic euphotic habitat was intermediate. Consequently, we hypothesized different temporal patterns of BC composition for all three habitats according to their environmental differences. We applied PERMANOVA, nonmetric multidimensional scaling and source-sink analysis to characterize BC composition. Overall, BCs were different among habitats with the littoral showing the highest variability and the hypolimnion the highest stability. The BC of rainy 2014 was distinct from the BCs of other years irrespective of the habitats considered. Seasonal differences in BCs were limited to spring, probably linked to meltwater inflow and mixing. Thus, temporal effects related to year and season were linked to the hydrological gradient of habitats. We suggest that despite potential within-lake dispersal of bacterioplankton by water flow and mixing, local environmental conditions played a major role in Lake Tovel, fostering distinct BCs in the three habitats.",2018,27,10.1111/mec.14855

Here we show that Lactobacillus reuteri coexists with species that belong to the Lactobacillus johnsonii cluster (L. johnsonii, L. gasseri, and L taiwanensis) in a taxonomically wide range of rodents, suggesting cohabitation over evolutionary times. The two dominant Lactobacillus species found in wild mice establish a commensalistic relationship in gastric biofilms when introduced together into germ-free mice in which L. reuteri facilitates colonization of L. taiwanensis. Genomic analysis revealed allopatric diversification in strains of both species that originated from geographically separated locations (Scotland and France). Allopatry of the strains resulted in reduced formation of mixed biofilms in vitro, indicating that interspecies interactions in gastric Lactobacillus-biofilms are the result of an adaptive evolutionary process that occurred in a biogeographical context. In summary, these findings suggest that members within the vertebrate gut microbiota can evolve inter-dependencies through ecological facilitation, which could represent one mechanism by which host-specific bacterial communities assemble across vertebrate species and an explanation for their spatial and biogeographic patterns.",2018,12,10.1038/s41396-018-0211-0

Several recent studies have shown predictable seasonal reoccurrence of bacterial assemblages. However, only a few have assessed temporal variability over both horizontal and vertical spatial scales. Here, we simultaneously studied the bacterial community structure at two different locations and depths in shelf waters of a coastal upwelling system during an annual cycle. The most noticeable biogeographic patterns observed were seasonality, horizontal homogeneity, and spatial synchrony in bacterial diversity and community structure related with regional upwelling-downwelling dynamics. Water column mixing eventually disrupted bacterial community structure vertical heterogeneity. Our results are consistent with previous temporal studies of marine bacterioplankton in other temperate regions and also suggest a marked influence of regional factors on the bacterial communities inhabiting this coastal upwelling system. Bacterial-mediated carbon fluxes in this productive region appear to be mainly controlled by community structure dynamics in surface waters, and local environmental factors at the base of the euphotic zone.",2018,76,10.1007/s00248-018-1179-z

Terrestrial hot springs typically contain thermophilic bacterial communities, but the diversity and impacts of its associated viruses (thermophilic phages) are largely unexplored. Here, we provide a taxonomic overview of phages that have been isolated strictly from terrestrial hot springs around the world. In addition, we placed 17 thermophilic phage genomes in a global phylogenomic context to detect evolutionary patterns. Thermophilic phages have diverse morphologies (e.g., tailed, filamentous), unique virion structures (e.g., extremely long tailed siphoviruses), and span five taxonomic families encompassing strictly thermophilic phage genera. Within the phage proteomic tree, six thermophilic phage-related clades were identified, with evident genomic relatedness between thermophilic phages and archaeal viruses. Moreover, whole proteome analyses showed clustering between phages that infect distinct host phyla, such as Firmicutes and Deinococcus-Thermus.

Therefore, they should show little population genetic structure due to high gene flow. Nevertheless, substantial genetic structure has been reported among populations of many taxa. In rotifers, genetic studies have focused on planktonic taxa leaving sessile groups largely unexplored. Here, we used COI gene and ITS region sequences to study genetic structure and delimit cryptic species in two sessile species (Limnias melicerta [32 populations]; L. ceratophylli [21 populations]). Among populations, ITS region sequences were less variable as compared to those of the COI gene (ITS; L. melicerta: 0-3.1% and L. ceratophylli: 0-4.4%; COI; L. melicerta: 0-22.7% and L. ceratophylli: 0-21.7%). Moreover, L. melicerta and L. ceratophylli were not resolved in phylogenetic analyses based on ITS sequences. Thus, we used COI sequences for species delimitation. Bayesian Species Delimitation detected nine putative cryptic species within L. melicerta and four putative cryptic species for L. ceratophylli. The genetic distance in the COI gene was 0-15.4% within cryptic species of L. melicerta and 0.5-0.6% within cryptic species of L. ceratophylli. Among cryptic species, COI genetic distance ranged 8.1-21.9% for L. melicerta and 15.1-21.2% for L. ceratophylli. The correlation between geographic and genetic distance was weak or lacking; thus geographic isolation cannot be considered a strong driver of genetic variation. In addition, geometric morphometric analyses of trophi did not show significant variation among cryptic species. In this study we used a conservative approach for species delimitation, yet we were able to show that species diversity in these sessile rotifers is underestimated.",2018,13,10.1371/journal.pone.0205203
"Li, W; Yuan, YL; Xia, Y; Sun, Y; Miao, YL; Ma, S",A Cross-Scale Neutral Theory Approach to the Influence of Obesity on Community Assembly of Human Gut Microbiome,FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY,"Background: The implications of gut microbiome to obesity have been extensively investigated in recent years although the exact mechanism is still unclear. The question whether or not obesity influences gut microbiome assembly has not been addressed. The question is significant because it is fundamental for investigating the diversity maintenance and stability of gut microbiome, and the latter should hold a key for understanding the etiological implications of gut microbiome to obesity. Methods: In this study, we adopt a dual neutral theory modeling strategy to address this question from both species and community perspectives, with both discrete and continuous neutral theory models. The first neutral theory model we apply is Hubbells neutral theory of biodiversity that has been extensively tested in macro-ecology of plants and animals, and the second we apply is Sloans neutral theory model that was developed particularly for microbial communities based on metagenomic sequencing data. Both the neutral models are complementary to each other and integrated together offering a comprehensive approach to more accurately revealing the possible influence of obesity on gut microbiome assembly. This is not only because the focus of both neutral theory models is different (community vs. species), but also because they adopted two different modeling strategies (discrete vs. continuous). Results: We test both the neutral theory models with datasets from Turnbaugh et al. (2009). Our tests showed that the species abundance distributions of more than 1/2 species (59-69%) in gut microbiome satisfied the prediction of Sloans neutral theory, although at the community level, the number of communities satisfied the Hubbells neutral theory was negligible (2 out of 278). Conclusion: The apparently contradictory findings above suggest that both stochastic neutral effects and deterministic environmental (host) factors play important roles in shaping the assembly and diversity of gut microbiome. Furthermore, obesity may just be one of the host factors, but its influence may not be strong enough to tip the balance between stochastic and deterministic forces that shape the community assembly. Finally, the apparent contradiction from both the neutral theories should not be surprising given that there are still near 30-40% species that do not obey the neutral law.",2018,9,10.3389/fmicb.2018.02320

While bacterioplankton communities in the Baltic Sea are strongly structured by salinity, how MBIs impact the composition and distribution of bacteria is unknown. The exceptional MBI in 2014, which brought saline and oxygenated water into the basins of the central Baltic Sea, enabled the linkage of microbiological investigations to hydrographic and modeling studies of this MBI. Using sequence data of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and 16S rRNA genes (rDNA), we analyzed bacterioplankton community composition in the inflowing water and in the uplifted former bottom water at stations reached by the MBI. Bacterial diversity data were compared with respective data obtained from previous, non-inflow conditions. Changes in bacterial community composition following the 2014 MBI were mainly apparent at the genus level. A number of specific taxa were enriched in the inflowing water, with large changes in the rRNA/rDNA ratios indicating the different activity levels between of the water masses. The relative similarity of the bacterial communities in the inflowing and uplifted waters as well as the results from an inflow-simulating numerical model showed that the inflowing water did not originate directly from the North Sea but mostly from adjacent areas in the Baltic Sea. This suggested that the inflow event led to a series of shifts in Baltic Sea water masses among the Baltic Sea basins and a gradual mixing of the water bodies. Dramatic changes in the bacterial community composition occurred when the bottom-water inflow reached the anoxic, sulfidic deep basins, resulting in an uplifting of the formerly anoxic bacterial community, dominated by Epsilonproteobacteria. Our study of the impact of MBIs on bacterioplankton communities therefore highlights two relevant underlying mechanisms that impact the distribution and possibly also the activities of planktonic bacteria in the Baltic Sea: (1) the successive dilution of inflowing North Sea water with ambient waters and (2) the uplifting of former bottom-water communities to higher water strata.",2018,5,10.3389/fmars.2018.00383

However, the diazotrophs in grassland soils are still far from fully investigated. Particularly, their regional-scale distribution patterns have never been systematically examined. Here, soils (0-5 cm) were sampled from 54 grasslands on the Tibetan Plateau to examine the diazotroph abundance, diversity, and community composition, as well as their distribution patterns and driving factors. The diazotroph abundance was expressed as nifH gene copies, measured using real-time PCR. The diversity and community composition of diazotrophs were analyzed through MiSeq sequencing of nifH genes. The results showed that Cyanobacteria (47.94%) and Proteobacteria (45.20%) dominated the soil diazotroph communities. Most Cyanobacteria were classified as Nostocales which are main components of biological crusts. Rhizobiales, most of which were identified as potential symbiotic diazotrophs, were also abundant in approximately half of the soil samples. The soil diazotroph abundance, diversity, and community composition followed the distribution patterns in line with mean annual precipitation. Moreover, they also showed significant correlations with prokaryotic abundance, plant biomass, vegetation cover, soil pH values, and soil nutrient contents. Among these environmental factors, the soil moisture, organic carbon, available phosphorus, and inorganic nitrogen contents could be the main drivers of diazotroph distribution due to their strong correlations with diazotroph indices. These findings suggest that autotrophic and symbiotic diazotrophs are the predominant nitrogen fixers in Tibetan grassland soils, and highlight the key roles of water and nutrient availability in determining the soil diazotroph distribution on the Tibetan Plateau.

Consequently, their traits drive community processes with profound effects on global biogeochemistry. Species traits are, however, not necessarily static but respond to environmental changes in order to maintain fitness and may differ with cell size that scales physiological rates. Comprehending such trait characteristics is necessary for a mechanistic understanding of plankton community dynamics and resulting biogeochemical impacts. Here, we used information theory to analyze metatranscriptomes of micro- and nano-dinoflagellate communities in three ecosystems. Measures of gene expression variations were set as a proxy to determine conserved and plastic community traits and the environmental influence on trait changes. Using metabarcoding, we further investigated if communities with a more similar taxon composition also express more similar traits. Our results indicate that plastic community traits mainly arise from membrane vesicle associated processes in all the environments we investigated. A specific environmental influence on trait plasticity was observed to arise from nitrogen availability in both size classes. Species interactions also appeared to be responsible for trait plasticity in the smaller-sized dinoflagellates. Additionally, the smaller-sized dinoflagellate communities are characterized by the expression of a large pool of habitat specific genes despite being taxonomically more similar across the habitats, in contrast to the microplanktonic assemblages that adapted to their environments by changing species composition. Our data highlight the functional diversification on the gene level as a signature of smaller sized dinoflagellates, nitrogen availability and species interactions as drivers of trait plasticity, and traits most likely linked to fitness and community performance.",2018,5,10.3389/fmars.2018.00358

We collected 30 water samples scattered across a quality gradient over two seasons and analyzed them using Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphisms (T-RFLP) coupled with 454 Pyrosequencing. Using T-RFLP we identified 451 and 442 Operational Taxonomy Units (OTUs) in the dry and rainy seasons respectively, whereas Pyrosequencing revealed 48,553 OTUs from which 11% were shared between seasons.

The extension was further inspired by a recent consensus that Hill numbers offer the most appropriate measures for alpha-diversity and multiplicative beta-diversity. In particular, Hill numbers are essentially a series of Renyis entropy values weighted differently along the rare-common-dominant spectrum of species abundance distribution and are in the units of effective number of species (or species equivalents such as OTUs). I therefore postulate that Hill numbers should follow the same or similar law of the traditional SAR. I test the postulation with the American gut microbiome project (AGP) dataset of 1,473 healthy North American individuals. I further propose three new concepts and develop their statistical estimation formulae based on the new DAR extension, including: (i) DAR profile-z-q relationship (DAR scaling parameter z at different diversity order q), (ii) PDO (pair-wise diversity overlap) profile-g-q relationship (PDO parameter g at order q, and (iii) MAD (maximal accrual diversity: D-max) profile-D-max-q. While the classic SAR is a special case of our new DAR profile, the PDO and MAD profiles offer novel tools for analyzing biodiversity (including alpha-diversity and beta-diversity) and biogeography over space.",2018,8,10.1002/ece3.4425

Taxa-area relationships (TARs) have been intensively examined, but the effects of temperature on TARs, particularly for microbial communities, are largely undocumented. Here we present a continental-scale description of temperature-dependent nested TARs of microbial communities (bacteria and archaea) from soils of six forest sites spanning a temperature gradient from subalpine Colorado to tropical Panama. Our results revealed that spatial scaling rates (z-values) of microbial communities varied with both taxonomic resolutions and phylogenetic groups. Additionally, microbial TAR z-values increased with temperature (r = 0.739, P < 0.05), but were not correlated with other environmental variables tested (P > 0.05), indicating that microbial spatial scaling rate is temperature-dependent. Understanding how temperature affects the spatial scaling of microbial biodiversity is of fundamental importance for preservation of soil biodiversity and management of ecosystems.",2018,20,10.1111/1462-2920.14303

This community is shaped by complex interacting forces, including microbial dispersal from surrounding environments and in-stream selection. However, how the processes structuring stream communities change over space and time remains poorly understood. In this study, we characterize spatial and temporal trends in microbial community composition throughout a stream network spanning first through fifth order streams. We found that the microbial communities of headwater streams are compositionally diverse, with low representation of freshwater microbial taxa and high representation of soil and sediment-associated taxa. In three out of five seasonal samplings, a successional pattern was identified in which phylotype richness and compositional heterogeneity decreased while the proportion of known freshwater taxa increased with increasing cumulative upstream dendritic distance. However, in two samplings, streams instead exhibited uniformly high microbial diversity across the watershed, and the fraction of freshwater taxa showed no relationship with dendritic distance. Overall, our data suggest that the successional processes that drive microbial diversity in streams are highly dynamic and can be disrupted at landscape scales, potentially in response to variation in temperature and precipitation.",2018,20,10.1111/1462-2920.14311

This is especially true of microorganisms, many of which may evolve in step with warming, including phytoplankton, the diverse photosynthetic microbes forming the foundation of most aquatic food webs. Here we tested the capacity of a globally important, model marine diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana, for rapid evolution in response to temperature. Selection at 16 and 31 degrees C for 350 generations led to significant divergence in several temperature response traits, demonstrating local adaptation and the existence of trade-offs associated with adaptation to different temperatures. In contrast, competitive ability for nitrogen (commonly limiting in marine systems), measured after 450 generations of temperature selection, did not diverge in a systematic way between temperatures. This study shows how rapid thermal adaptation affects key temperature and nutrient traits and, thus, a populations long-term physiological, ecological, and biogeographic response to climate change.",2018,24,10.1111/gcb.14360

Yet, basic knowledge about their species composition and community assembly is lacking. Here, we begin to fill this knowledge gap by performing the first large-scale survey of microalgal diversity in acidic geothermal sites across the West Pacific Island Chain. We collected 72 environmental samples in 12 geothermal sites, measured temperature and pH, and performed rbcL amplicon-based 454 pyrosequencing. Using these data, we estimated the diversity of microalgal species, and then examined the relative contribution of contemporary selection (i.e., local environmental variables) and dispersal limitation on the assembly of these communities. A species delimitation analysis uncovered seven major microalgae (fourred, two green, and one diatom) and higher species diversity than previously appreciated. A distance-based redundancy analysis with variation partitioning revealed that dispersal limitation has a greater influence on the community assembly of microalgae than contemporary selection. Consistent with this finding, community similarity among the sampled sites decayed more quickly over geographical distance than differences in environmental factors. Our work paves the way for future studies to understand the ecology and biogeography of microalgae in extreme habitats.",2018,54,10.1111/jpy.12771

The aim of this study is to analyze the occurrence and diversity of phages in the North Sea, considering the virus-host interactions and biogeographic factors. The virus community of four sampling stations were described using virus metagenomics (viromes). The results show that the virus community was not evenly distributed throughout the North Sea. The dominant phage members were identified as unclassified phage group, followed by Caudovirales order. Myoviridae was the dominant phage family in the North Sea, which occurrence decreased from the coast to the open sea. In contrast, the occurrence of Podoviridae increased and the occurrence of Siphoviridae was low throughout the North Sea. The occurrence of other groups such as Phycodnaviridae decreased from the coast to the open sea. The coastal virus community was genetically more diverse than the open sea community. The influence of riverine inflow and currents, for instance the English Channel flow affects the genetic virus diversity with the community carrying genes from a variety of metabolic pathways and other functions.

We hypothesized that abiotic and/or biotic interactions are probably more important for explaining the distribution patterns of marine bacterioplankton than environmental filtering. In this study, surface seawater samples were collected about 7000 miles from the Mediterranean Sea, transecting the North Atlantic Ocean, to the Brazilian marginal sea. In bacterial biosphere, SAR11, SAR86, Rhodobacteraceae, and Rhodospiriaceae were predominant in the Mediterranean Sea; Prochlorococcus was more frequent in Atlantic Ocean: whereas in the Brazilian coastal sea, the main bacterial members were Synechococcus and SAR11. With respect to archaea, Eloyarchaeota were predominant in the Atlantic Ocean and Thaumarchaeota in the Mediterranean Sea. With respect to the eukaryotes, Syndiniales, Spumellaria, Ciyomonadida, and Chlorodendrales were predominant in the open ocean, while diatoms and microzooplankton were dominant in the coastal sea. Distinct clusters of prokaryotes and eukaryotes displayed clear spatial heterogeneity. Among the environmental parameters measured, temperature and salinity were key factors controlling bacterial and archaeal community structure, respectively, whereas N/P/Si contributed to eukaryotic variation. The relative contribution of environmental parameters to the microbial distribution pattern was 45.2%. Interaction analysis showed that Gammaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, and 1.7avobacteriia were the keystone taxa within the positive-correlation network, while Thermoplasmata was the main contributor in the negativecorrelation network. Our study demonstrated that microbial communities are co-governed by environmental filtering and biotic interactions, which are the main deterministic driving factors modulating the spatiotemporal patterns of marine plankton synergistically at the regional or global levels.",2018,76,10.1007/s00248-018-1150-z

However, the origination and development of antibiotics has yet to be explicitly investigated. Due to diverse structures and similar biosynthesis, glycosylated polyene macrolides (gPEMs) were chosen to explore antibiotic evolution. A total of 130 candidate and 38 transitional gPEM clusters were collected from actinomycetes genomes, providing abundant references for phenotypic gaps in gPEM evolution. The most conserved parts of gPEM biosynthesis were found and used for phylogeny construction. On this basis, we proposed ancestral gPEM clusters at different evolutionary stages and interpreted the possible evolutionary histories in detail. The results revealed that gPEMs evolved from small rings to large rings and continuously increased structural diversity through acquiring, discarding and exchanging genes from different evolutionary origins, as well as co-evolution of functionally related proteins. The combination of horizontal gene transfers, environmental effects and host preference resulted in the diversity and worldwide distribution of gPEMs. This study is not only a useful exploration on antibiotic evolution but also an inspiration for diversity and biogeographic investigations on antibiotics in the era of Big Data.",2018,127,10.1016/j.ympev.2018.06.005

In this paper, we utilize a biogeography database summarizing data on AMF species distribution linked to geographic and environmental conditions to describe global distribution patterns and interpret these patterns within a phylogenetic perspective. The data were obtained from accessions in living culture collections (INVAM, CICG), species descriptions, and other published literature from 1960 to 2012. The database contains 7105 records, 6396 of them from 768 published papers and the remaining 709 from culture accessions. Glomeromycotan species were recorded in all seven continents, 87 countries, 11 biogeographical realms, and 14 biomes. The distribution of families differed among climatic zones and continents, but they. together with all genera, appear to be cosmopolitan. Distribution of AMF species shows a slight decrease from low to high latitudes, but this decrease is steeper in the southern than in the northern hemisphere. A total of 189 species is shared between ancient supercontinents Gondwana and Laurasia and 78 species are common to all climatic zones. Ninety five species (43% of the total) have known cosmopolitan distribution, including members of all genera except Redeckera. Some species have disjunct distribution and 26% of species have been registered from only one continent.

Denitrification (DNF) has been widely studied, but assimilatory nitrate reduction (ANR) and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) have received much less attention. Their ecological patterns and responsible microbes are poorly understood. Here, we studied the structure and function succession of the three functional groups in the middle route of the South-to-NorthWater Diversion Project, which is a 1230 km canal spanning 8 degrees of latitude. The results reflected a nitrogen-removing pattern dominated by DNF in the summer and a nitrogen-retaining pattern dominated by ANR and DNRA in the winter. Stenotrophomonas, a typical denitrifier, was the keystone species in the summer and contributed to N2O production. Clostridium, a genus able to conduct ANR and DNRA, was the keystone species in the winter. Notably, a significant zonation pattern was discovered. According to the community structure, the system could be separated into two biogeographic zones, and the Yellow River (about latitude 35 degrees N) is an important cut-off line. This bacterial biogeography followed differentwater characteristics and ecological processes. ANR was found to be an important process and seasonally transformed its habitat from the northern zone to the southern zone. DNRA bacteria were acclimated to the northern zone and favored at this region in both seasons. The generation of N2O, a strong greenhouse gas, also exhibited this zonation pattern. This is the first study to consider assimilatory and dissimilatory nitrate reducers together at a molecular level, and provides new insights into the underlying patterns of a nitrate-reducing bacterioplankton community.

"Azovsky, AI",Robustness of relative diversity metrics to inventory incompleteness: Could we estimate the near imponderable?,GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY,"Aim Relative diversity metrics (RDMs), such as local : global or regional : global diversity ratios and percentage of endemics, are widely applied in biodiversity studies. This approach, however, is flawed because the real global diversity of many taxa is still largely unknown, especially for rare species. This potential inconsistency of RDMs has not been proved (or disproved) thus far. Here, I use simulation models to explore the efficiency of RDM estimations from incomplete inventories. Location Methods World-wide. Three simple models of species distribution were used: (a) the everything is everywhere model (unlimited dispersal, i.e., equal probability for a species to occur at every point); (b) the environmental selection model (each species can occupy only a portion of randomly distributed suitable localities according to its ecological preferences); and (c) the endemicity model (most species are restricted to a few regions each). To parameterize these models, the world-wide datasets on ciliates, flagellates and harpacticoid copepods were used. The RDMs were estimated by simulating equal-effort sampling and by varying the full number of species and number of sampled individuals per cell. Results Main conclusions Estimated species richness at any scale was heavily influenced by the sampling effort and was greatly underestimated with small sample sizes. The estimated RDM values also depended on the sampling effort (being either upward or downward biased) but were only slightly influenced by the unrecorded part of real global diversity (ignorance). The predictions of the first two models were generally close to each other but differed noticeably from those of the third model. The relative metrics, albeit influenced by undersampling, are nevertheless more robust to inventory incompleteness than absolute measures and can therefore be a reliable tool in comparative biodiversity studies, even if the true number of species cannot be estimated overall. Their estimated values, however, must be interpreted with caution.",2018,27,10.1111/geb.12777

In Central America, the main vector is Triatoma dimidiata, an opportunistic blood meal feeder inhabiting both domestic and sylvatic ecotopes. Given the diversity of interacting biological agents involved in the epidemiology of Chagas disease, having simultaneous information on the dynamics of the parasite, vector, the gut micro biome of the vector, and the blood meal source would facilitate identifying key biotic factors associated with the risk of T. cruzi transmission. In this study, we developed a RADseq-based analysis pipeline to study mixed-species DNA extracted from T. dimidiata abdomens. To evaluate the efficacy of the method across spatial scales, we used a nested spatial sampling design that spanned from individual villages within Guatemala to major biogeographic regions of Central America. Information from each biotic source was distinguished with bioinformatics tools and used to evaluate the prevalence of T. cruzi infection and predominant Discrete Typing Units (DTUs) in the region, the population genetic structure of T. dimidiata, gut microbial diversity, and the blood meal history. An average of 3.25 million reads per specimen were obtained, with approximately 1% assigned to the parasite, 20% to the vector, 11% to bacteria, and 4% to putative blood meals. Using a total of 6,405 T. cruzi SNPs, we detected nine infected vectors harboring two distinct DTUs: Tcl and a second unidentified strain, possibly TcIV. Vector specimens were sufficiently variable for population genomic analyses, with a total of 25,710 T. dimidiata SNPs across all samples that were sufficient to detect geographic genetic structure at both local and regional scales. We observed a diverse microbiotic community, with significantly higher bacterial species richness in infected T. dimidiata abdomens than those that were not infected. Unifrac analysis suggests a common assemblage of bacteria associated with infection, which co-occurs with the typical gut microbial community derived from the local environment. We identified vertebrate blood meals from five T. dimidiata abdomens, including chicken, dog, duck and human; however, additional detection methods would be necessary to confidently identify blood meal sources from most specimens. Overall, our study shows this method is effective for simultaneously generating genetic data on vectors and their associated parasites, along with ecological information on feeding patterns and microbial interactions that may be followed up with complementary approaches such as PCR-based parasite detection, 18S eukaryotic and 16S bacterial barcoding.",2018,12,10.1371/journal.pntd.0006730

Physical and chemical parameters were measured in order to explain what might control the observed patterns in community composition and diversity. In response to environmental changes between seasons, especially the dramatic changes of temperature and nutrient (NO2-N and PO4-P) levels, Synechococcus and unclassified genera in Family I predominated in summer while some oligotrophic taxa (e.g., Pelagibacter, OM43 Glade) are more abundant in winter. The spatial heterogeneity and overall patchiness of bacterial assemblages in the Bohai Strait could not be well explained by the measured factors. However, the taxa with the most spatially variable presence and absence, e.g. Vibrionaceae, SAR11 and Sva0996 marine group, possess differentiated niches for utilization of organic matter (OM) and display a close relationship with the distribution of OM sources in this area, which may indicate the significance of OM sources to bacterial community structure.

We measured routine metabolism in two hydrothermal vent gastropods, Alviniconcha marisindica (n = 40) and the scaly-foot gastropod Chrysomallon squamiferum (n = 18), from Kairei and Edmond vent fields on the Central Indian Ridge (23-25 degrees S, about 3000 meter depth). No previous studies have measured metabolism in any Indian Ocean vent animals. After recovering healthy animals to the surface, we performed shipboard closed-chamber respirometry experiments to compare oxygen uptake at different temperatures (10, 16, and 25 degrees C) at surface pressure (1 atm). The physiology of these species is driven by the demands of their chemoautotrophic symbionts. Chrysomallon has very enlarged respiratory and circulatory systems, and endosymbionts are housed in its trophosome-like internal esophageal gland. By contrast, Alviniconcha has chemoautotrophic bacteria within the gill and less extensive associated anatomical adaptations. Thus, we predicted that routine oxygen consumption of Chrysomallon might be higher than that of Alviniconcha. However, oxygen consumption of Chrysomallon was not higher than that of Alviniconcha, and, further, Chrysomallon maintained a steady metabolic demand in two widely separated experimental temperatures, while Alviniconcha did not. We interpret that these findings indicate that (1) the trophosome does not fundamentally increase oxygen requirement compared to other gastropod holobionts, and (2) cold temperatures (10 degrees C) induce a stress response in Alviniconcha, resulting in aberrantly high uptake. While these two large gastropod species co-occur, differences in oxygen consumption may reflect the separate niches they occupy in the vent ecosystem.",2018,235,10.1086/699326

Spatial patterns have been detected in planktonic bacterial communities at distances <20 m, but little is known about the occurrence of similar variation for other microbial groups and changes in microbial meta-community assembly at different levels of a meta-community. To examine this variation, the biofilm of eight saline ponds were used to investigate processes shaping diversity within ponds (beta) and between ponds (delta). Bacterial and ciliate communities were assessed using ARISA and T-RFLP respectively, while diversity partitioning methods were used to examine the importance of taxonomic turnover and variation partitioning was used to distinguish spatial from environmental determinants. The results show that turnover is important for determining beta- and delta-diversity of biofilms. Spatial factors are important drivers of bacterial beta-diversity but were unimportant for ciliate beta-diversity. Environmental variation was a strong determinant of bacterial and ciliate delta-diversity, suggesting sorting processes are important for assembling pond communities. Determinants of diversity in bacteria are not universal for ciliates, suggesting higher functional redundancy of bacteria or the greater niche breadth of ciliates may be important in discriminating assembly processes between the two organisms.",2018,94,10.1093/femsec/fiy148

Limited data are available on the composition and structure of bacterial communities (BCs) associated with Phormidium biofilms despite the important role they potentially play in biofilm functioning. By using a high-throughput sequencing approach, we compared the BCs associated with Phormidium biofilms in several sampling sites of the Tarn River (France) and in eight New Zealand rivers. The structure of the BCs from both countries displayed spatial and temporal variations but were well conserved at the order level and 28% of the OTUs containing 90% of the reads were shared by these BCs. This suggests that micro-environmental conditions occurring within thick Phormidium biofilms strongly shape the associated BCs. A strong and significant distance-decay relationship (r(p) = 0.7; P = 0.001) was found in BCs from New Zealand rivers but the Bray-Curtis dissimilarities between French and New Zealand BCs are in the same order of magnitude of those found between New Zealand BCs. All these findings suggest that local environmental conditions seem to have more impact on BCs than dispersal capacities of bacteria.",2018,8,10.1038/s41598-018-32772-w
"Wang, BX; Adachi, Y; Sugiyama, S",Soil productivity and structure of bacterial and fungal communities in unfertilized arable soil,PLOS ONE,"Soil productivity is strongly influenced by the activities of microbial communities. However, it is not well understood how community structure, including its richness, mass, and composition, influences soil functions. We investigated the relationships between soil productivity and microbial communities in unfertilized arable soils extending over 1000 km in eastern Japan. Soil properties, including C turnover rate, N mineralization rate, microbial C, and various soil chemical properties, were measured. Soil bacterial and fungal communities were analyzed by Illuminas MiSeq using 16S rRNA and ITS regions. In addition, root microbial communities from maize grown in each soil were also investigated. Soil bacterial communities shared many operational taxonomic units (OTUs) among farms. An ordination plot based on correspondence analysis revealed convergent distribution of soil bacterial communities across the farms, which seemed to be a result of similar agricultural management practices. Although fungal communities showed lower richness and a lower proportion of shared OTUs than bacterial communities, community structure between the farms tended to be convergent. On the other hand, root communities had lower richness and a higher abundance of specific taxa than the soil communities. Two soil functions, decomposition activity and soil productivity, were extracted by principal component analysis (PCA) based on eight soil properties. Soil productivity correlated with N mineralization rate, P2O5, and maize growth, but not with decomposition activity, which is characterized by C turnover rate, soil organic C, and microbial mass. Soil productivity showed a significant association with community composition, but not with richness and mass of soil microbial communities. Soil productivity also correlated with the abundance of several specific taxa, both in bacteria and fungi. Root communities did not show any clear correlations with soil productivity. These results demonstrate that community composition and abundance of soil microbial communities play important roles in determining soil productivity.",2018,13,10.1371/journal.pone.0204085

While these iconic birds have been intensely studied, the composition of their gut microbiome and the factors influencing it, including host species, diet, and biogeography, has not yet been explored. Results: We characterized the microbial community associated with 12 species of Darwins finches using high-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing of fecal samples from 114 individuals across nine islands, including the unusual blood-feeding vampire finch (Geospiza septentrionalis) from Darwin and Wolf Islands. The phylum-level core gut microbiome for Darwins finches included the Firmicutes, Gammaproteobacteria, and Actinobacteria, with members of the Bacteroidetes at conspicuously low abundance. The gut microbiome was surprisingly well conserved across the diversity of finch species, with one exception-the vampire finch-which harbored bacteria that were either absent or extremely rare in other finches, including Fusobacterium, Cetobacterium, Ureaplasma, Mucispirillum, Campylobacter, and various members of the Clostridia-bacteria known from the guts of carnivorous birds and reptiles. Complementary stable isotope analysis of feathers revealed exceptionally high delta N-15 isotope values in the vampire finch, resembling top marine predators. The Galapagos archipelago is also known for extreme wet and dry seasons, and we observed a significant seasonal shift in the gut microbial community of five additional finch species sampled during both seasons. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the overall conservatism of the finch gut microbiome over short (< 1 Ma) divergence timescales, except in the most extreme case of dietary specialization, and elevates the evolutionary importance of seasonal shifts in driving not only species adaptation, but also gut microbiome composition.",2018,6,10.1186/s40168-018-0555-8

Although many techniques have been developed to solve this problem, it is still challenging to identify the model parameters accurately and reliably. To improve parameters identification of different photovoltaic models, a multiple learning backtracking search algorithm (MLBSA) is proposed in this paper. In MLBSA, some individuals learn from the current population information and historical population information simultaneously, which aims to maintain population diversity and enhance the exploration ability. While other individuals learn from the best individual of current population to improve the convergence speed and thus enhance the exploitation ability. In addition, an elite strategy based on chaotic local search is developed to further refine the quality of current population. The proposed MLBSA is employed to solve the parameters identification problems of different photovoltaic models, i.e., single diode, double diode, and photovoltaic module. Comprehensive experimental results and analyses demonstrate that MLBSA outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of accuracy, reliability, and computational efficiency.",2018,226,10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.06.010

Recent studies have identified bats as potential hosts of species from the proteobacteria phylum. In Brazil, however, the role of bats in the natural cycle of these agents is poorly investigated and generally neglected. In order to analyze the participation of bats in the epidemiology of diseases caused by Bartonella, Coxiella, Rickettsia, Anaplasma and Ehrlichia, we conducted a descriptive epidemiological study in three biogeographic regions of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Results: Tissues of 119 bats captured in preserved areas in the states of Rio de Janeiro, Bahia and Santa Catarina from 2014 to 2015 were submitted to molecular analysis using specific primers. Bartonella spp. was detected in 22 spleen samples (18.5%, 95% CI: 11.9-26.6), whose phylogenetic analysis revealed the generation of at least two independent clusters, suggesting that these may be new unique genotypes of Bartonella species. In addition, four samples (3.4%, 95% CI: 0.9-8.3) were positive for the htpAB gene of C. burnetii [spleen (2), liver (1) and heart (1)]. Rickettsia spp., Anaplasma and Ehrlichia were not identified. This is the first study reporting C. burnetii and Bartonella spp. infections in bats from the Atlantic Forest biome.

The biogeography of morphological, functional, and life-history traits of marine diatoms were investigated in Arctic and Atlantic waters of the Labrador Sea during the spring bloom (2013-2014). In this study, trait-based analysis using community-weighted means showed that low temperatures (<0 degrees C) in Arctic waters correlated positively with diatom species that have traits such as low temperature optimum growth and the ability to produced ice-binding proteins, highlighting their sea ice origin. High silicate concentrations in Arctic waters, as well as sea ice cover and shallow bathymetry, favoured diatom species that were heavily silicified, colonial and capable of producing resting spores, suggesting that these are important traits for this community. In Atlantic waters, diatom species with large surface area to volume ratios were dominant in deep mixed layers, whilst low silicate to nitrate ratios correlated positively with weakly silicified species. Sharp cell projections, such as processes or spines, were positively correlated with water-column stratification, indicating that these traits promote positive buoyancy for diatom cells. Our trait-based analysis directly links cell morphology and physiology with diatom species distribution, allowing new insights on how this method can potentially be applied to explain ecophysiology and shifting biogeographical distributions in a warming climate.",2018,5,10.3389/fmars.2018.00297
"Yan, W; Zhang, R; Jiao, NZ",A Long-Standing Complex Tropical Dipole Shapes Marine Microbial Biogeography,APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY,"Microbial population size, production, diversity, and community structure are greatly influenced by the surrounding physicochemical conditions, such as large-scale biogeographic provinces and water masses. An oceanic mesoscale dipole consists of a cyclonic eddy and an anticyclonic eddy. Dipoles occur frequently in the ocean and usually last from a few days to several months; they have significant impacts on local and global oceanic biological, ecological, and geochemical processes. To better understand how dipoles shape microbial communities, we examined depth-resolved distributions of microbial communities across a dipole in the South China Sea. Our data demonstrated that the dipole had a substantial influence on microbial distributions, community structure, and functional groups both vertically and horizontally. Large alpha and beta diversity differences were observed between anticyclonic and cyclonic eddies in surface and subsurface layers, consistent with distribution changes of major bacterial groups in the dipole. The dipole created uplift, downward transport, enrichment, depletion, and horizontal transport effects. We also found that the edge of the dipole might induce strong subduction, indicated by the presence of Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus in deep waters. Our findings suggest that dipoles, with their unique characteristics, might act as a driver for microbial community dynamics. IMPORTANCE Oceanic dipoles, which consist of a cyclonic eddy and an anticyclonic eddy together, are among the most contrasted phenomena in the ocean. Dipoles generate strong vertical mixing and horizontal advection, inducing biological responses. This study provides vertical profiles of microbial abundance, diversity, and community structure in a mesoscale dipole. We identify the links between the physical oceanography and microbial oceanography and demonstrate that the dipole, with its unique features, could act as a driver for microbial community dynamics, which may have large impacts on both the local and global marine biogeochemical cycles.",2018,84,10.1128/AEM.00614-18

The integrated agricultural practice (IP) developed in northeast China, by altering row spacing of planting, adopting no-tillage and returning all crop residues, showed great benefit in sustaining crop yield. However, its effect on the soil microbiome remains largely elusive. This study evaluated the effect of 12-year integrated agricultural practice on the structure and activity of the soil microbial community at different soil depths in Chinas Mollisols zone. The experiment consisted of integrated agricultural practice and conventional practice (CP) treatments in a split-plot arrangement. The soil microbial community was characterized by MiSeq sequencing. The results showed that agricultural practices affected 12 phyla, 24 classes, 32 orders and 75 families in the bacterial community and one phyla, four classes, 12 orders and 18 families in the fungal community. Integrated agricultural practice resulted in greater bacterial richness and diversity, and increased the relative abundances of Actinobacteria, Gemmatimonadetes, Verrucomicrobia and Ascomycota, but reduced Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Basidiomycota in the dominant bacterial and fungal phyla. These findings suggested that integrated agricultural practice modified the soil physiochemical properties and consequently altered microbial community structure and diversity, which in turn affected soil microbial biomass and enzyme activities. These changes under integrated agricultural practice could have contributed to the enhanced crop yield, suggesting that IP is a sustainable agricultural practice.",2018,69,10.1111/ejss.12679
"Ribeiro, KF; Duarte, L; Crossetti, LO",Everything is not everywhere: a tale on the biogeography of cyanobacteria,HYDROBIOLOGIA,"Microrganisms such as cyanobacteria have been often considered as exhibiting wide distribution mainly driven by environmental heterogeneity. Recently, however, new findings have evoked the role of previously neglected processes, such as dispersal limitation, determining the distribution of a wide range of microorganisms, including cyanobacteria. Here, we reviewed the biogeographic patterns of cyanobacteria with focus on molecular data and the evidences from the published literature for the processes driving these patterns. Also, considerations are made about concept of species, discordances in the taxonomic concepts, and level of taxonomic resolution, and how these affect the biogeographic study of cyanobacteria. From a overview, it can be observed that both environmental and historical factors are important to structure cyanobacteria diversity across time and space. Moreover, different species may exhibit significant differences in their distribution patterns, from possibly cosmopolitan species to other endemic species. However, distribution patterns are closely dependent on the concept of species, besides the taxonomic resolution, spatial and environmental scales, and the biases of the molecular methodologies applied in the studies. Thus, efforts to broaden sampling and sequencing of unknown and less-known species, as well as geographic regions and habitats poorly exploited, are crucial for a better understanding of cyanobacteria biogeography.",2018,820,10.1007/s10750-018-3669-x
"Choudoir, MJ; Buckley, DH",Phylogenetic conservatism of thermal traits explains dispersal limitation and genomic differentiation of Streptomyces sister-taxa,ISME JOURNAL,"The latitudinal diversity gradient is a pattern of biogeography observed broadly in plants and animals but largely undocumented in terrestrial microbial systems. Although patterns of microbial biogeography across broad taxonomic scales have been described in a range of contexts, the mechanisms that generate biogeographic patterns between closely related taxa remain incompletely characterized. Adaptive processes are a major driver of microbial biogeography, but there is less understanding of how microbial biogeography and diversification are shaped by dispersal limitation and drift. We recently described a latitudinal diversity gradient of species richness and intraspecific genetic diversity in Streptomyces by using a geographically explicit culture collection. Within this geographically explicit culture collection, we have identified Streptomyces sister-taxa whose geographic distribution is delimited by latitude. These sister-taxa differ in geographic distribution, genomic diversity, and ecological traits despite having nearly identical SSU rRNA gene sequences. Comparative genomic analysis reveals genomic differentiation of these sister-taxa consistent with restricted gene flow across latitude. Furthermore, we show phylogenetic conservatism of thermal traits between the sister-taxa suggesting that thermal trait adaptation limits dispersal and gene flow across climate regimes as defined by latitude. Such phylogenetic conservatism of thermal traits is commonly associated with latitudinal diversity gradients for plants and animals. These data provide further support for the hypothesis that the Streptomyces latitudinal diversity gradient was formed as a result of historical demographic processes defined by dispersal limitation and driven by paleoclimate dynamics.",2018,12,10.1038/s41396-018-0180-3

Since the early twentieth century, it has been known that B vitamins play an important role in phytoplankton community dynamics. Limited oceanic dissolved B vitamin distributions indicate that these important coenzymes are present at picomolar levels, which could be too low to support maximal phytoplankton growth, and vast regions of the ocean exist where they are undetectable. Despite their importance, particulate B vitamin concentrations of field microbial populations are unknown. Here we report B vitamin concentrations measured in both the particulate and dissolved fractions, including multiple biochemically relevant B vitamin congeners. We establish their spatial distributions spanning distinct biogeographic and oceanographic regimes in the Mediterranean Sea and the Eastern Atlantic Ocean and show that all congeners are present both dissolved in seawater and in suspended particles. We observe that B vitamins cooccur in patches defined by regional biogeographic and oceanographic features. Additionally, distinct patterns of congener relative abundance in the dissolved and particulate pools provide insight to biological and chemical cycling of these compounds between and within the dissolved and particulate pools. Finally, linear model results demonstrate that model fits of microbial assemblages are strongest when they include both inorganic nutrients and dissolved B vitamin concentrations. We believe that these findings represent an advance in our understanding of B vitamin oceanographic distributions and point to interesting hypotheses of their influence on marine microbial ecology.",2018,123,10.1029/2018JG004554

Since the turn of the 20th century, MSR water quality has continually rated poorly due to human activity. Acting as first responders, microorganisms can mitigate, exacerbate, and/or serve as predictors for water quality, yet we know little about their community structure or ecology at the whole river scale for large rivers. We collected both biological (16S and 18S rRNA gene amplicons) and physicochemical data from 38 MSR sites over nearly 3000 km from Minnesota to the Gulf of Mexico. Our results revealed a microbial community composed of similar taxa to other rivers but with unique trends in the relative abundance patterns among phyla, operational taxonomic units (OTUs), and the core microbiome. Furthermore, we observed a separation in microbial communities that mirrored the transition from an 8th to 10th Strahler order river at the Missouri River confluence, marking a different start to the lower MSR than the historical distinction at the Ohio River confluence in Cairo, IL. Within MSR microbial assemblages, we identified subgroups of OTUs from the phyla Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Oomycetes, and Heterokonts that were associated with, and predictive of, the important eutrophication nutrients nitrate and phosphate. This study offers the most comprehensive view of MSR microbiota to date, provides important groundwork for higher resolution microbial studies of river perturbation, and identifies potential microbial indicators of river health related to eutrophication.",2018,63,10.1002/lno.10811
"Gaulke, CA; Arnold, HK; Humphreys, IR; Kembel, SW; ODwyer, JP; Sharpton, TJ",Ecophylogenetics Clarifies the Evolutionary Association between Mammals and Their Gut Microbiota,MBIO,"Our knowledge of how the gut microbiome relates to mammalian evolution benefits from the identification of gut microbial taxa that are unexpectedly prevalent or unexpectedly conserved across mammals. Such taxa enable experimental determination of the traits needed for such microbes to succeed as gut generalists, as well as those traits that impact mammalian fitness. However, the punctuated resolution of microbial taxonomy may limit our ability to detect conserved gut microbes, especially in cases in which broadly related microbial lineages possess shared traits that drive their apparent ubiquity across mammals. To advance the discovery of conserved mammalian gut microbes, we developed a novel ecophylogenetic approach to taxonomy that groups microbes into taxonomic units based on their shared ancestry and their common distribution across mammals. Applying this approach to previously generated gut microbiome data uncovered monophyletic clades of gut bacteria that are conserved across mammals. It also resolved microbial clades exclusive to and conserved among particular mammalian lineages. Conserved clades often manifest phylogenetic patterns, such as cophylogeny with their host, that indicate that they are subject to selective processes, such as host filtering. Moreover, this analysis identified variation in the rate at which mammals acquire or lose conserved microbial clades and resolved a human-accelerated loss of conserved clades. Collectively, the data from this study reveal mammalian gut microbiota that possess traits linked to mammalian phylogeny, point to the existence of a core set of microbes that comprise the mammalian gut microbiome, and clarify potential evolutionary or ecologic mechanisms driving the gut microbiomes diversification throughout mammalian evolution. IMPORTANCE Our understanding of mammalian evolution has become microbiome-aware. While emerging research links mammalian biodiversity and the gut microbiome, we lack insight into which microbes potentially impact mammalian evolution. Microbes common to diverse mammalian species may be strong candidates, as their absence in the gut may affect how the microbiome functionally contributes to mammalian physiology to adversely affect fitness. Identifying such conserved gut microbes is thus important to ultimately assessing the microbiomes potential role in mammalian evolution. To advance their discovery, we developed an approach that identifies ancestrally related groups of microbes that distribute across mammals in a way that indicates their collective conservation. These conserved clades are presumed to have evolved a trait in their ancestor that matters to their distribution across mammals and which has been retained among clade members. We found not only that such clades do exist among mammals but also that they appear to be subject to natural selection and characterize human evolution.",2018,9,10.1128/mBio.01348-18

A major barrier to mechanistic studies is the lack of tools for the efficient genetic manipulation of wild and diverse bacterial isolates. To address the need for improved molecular tools, we used a collection of proteobacterial isolates native to the zebrafish intestinal microbiota as a testbed to construct a series of modernized vectors that expedite genetic knock-in and knockout procedures across lineages. The innovations that we introduce enhance the flexibility of conventional genetic techniques, making it easier to manipulate many different bacterial isolates with a single set of tools. We developed alternative strategies for domestication-free conjugation, designed plasmids with customizable features, and streamlined allelic exchange using visual markers of homologous recombination. We demonstrate the potential of these tools through a comparative study of bacterial behavior within the zebrafish intestine. Live imaging of fluorescently tagged isolates revealed a spectrum of distinct population structures that differ in their biogeography and dominant growth mode (i.e., planktonic versus aggregated). Most striking, we observed divergent genotype-phenotype relationships: several isolates that are predicted by genomic analysis and in vitro assays to be capable of flagellar motility do not display this trait within living hosts. Together, the tools generated in this work provide a new resource for the functional characterization of wild and diverse bacterial lineages that will help speed the research pipeline from sequencing-based correlations to mechanistic underpinnings. IMPORTANCE A great challenge in microbiota research is the immense diversity of symbiotic bacteria with the capacity to impact the lives of plants and animals. Moving beyond correlative DNA sequencing-based studies to define the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which symbiotic bacteria influence the biology of their hosts is stalling because genetic manipulation of new and uncharacterized bacterial isolates remains slow and difficult with current genetic tools. Moreover, developing tools de novo is an arduous and time-consuming task and thus represents a significant barrier to progress. To address this problem, we developed a suite of engineering vectors that streamline conventional genetic techniques by improving postconjugation counterselection, modularity, and allelic exchange. Our modernized tools and step-by-step protocols will empower researchers to investigate the inner workings of both established and newly emerging models of bacterial symbiosis.",2018,9,10.1128/mBio.01877-18
"Rohwer, RR; Hamilton, JJ; Newton, RJ; McMahon, KD",TaxAss: Leveraging a Custom Freshwater Database Achieves Fine-Scale Taxonomic Resolution,MSPHERE,"Taxonomy assignment of freshwater microbial communities is limited by the minimally curated phylogenies used for large taxonomy databases. Here we introduce TaxAss, a taxonomy assignment workflow that classifies 16S rRNA gene amplicon data using two taxonomy reference databases: a large comprehensive database and a small ecosystem-specific database rigorously curated by scientists within a field. We applied TaxAss to five different freshwater data sets using the comprehensive SILVA database and the freshwater-specific FreshTrain database. TaxAss increased the percentage of the data set classified compared to using only SILVA, especially at fine-resolution family to species taxon levels, while across the freshwater test data sets classifications increased by as much as 11 to 40% of total reads. A similar increase in classifications was not observed in a control mouse gut data set, which was not expected to contain freshwater bacteria. TaxAss also maintained taxonomic richness compared to using only the FreshTrain across all taxon levels from phylum to species. Without TaxAss, most organisms not represented in the FreshTrain were unclassified, but at fine taxon levels, incorrect classifications became significant. We validated TaxAss using simulated amplicon data derived from full-length clone libraries and found that 96 to 99% of test sequences were correctly classified at fine resolution. TaxAss splits a data sets sequences into two groups based on their percent identity to reference sequences in the ecosystem-specific database. Sequences with high similarity to sequences in the ecosystem-specific database are classified using that database, and the others are classified using the comprehensive database. TaxAss is free and open source and is available at https://www.github.com/McMahonLab/TaxAss. IMPORTANCE Microbial communities drive ecosystem processes, but microbial community composition analyses using 16S rRNA gene amplicon data sets are limited by the lack of fine-resolution taxonomy classifications. Coarse taxonomic groupings at the phylum, class, and order levels lump ecologically distinct organisms together. To avoid this, many researchers define operational taxonomic units (OTUs) based on clustered sequences, sequence variants, or unique sequences. These fine-resolution groupings are more ecologically relevant, but OTU definitions are data set dependent and cannot be compared between data sets. Microbial ecologists studying freshwater have curated a small, ecosystem-specific taxonomy database to provide consistent and up-to-date terminology. We created TaxAss, a workflow that leverages this database to assign taxonomy. We found that TaxAss improves fine-resolution taxonomic classifications (family, genus, and species). Fine taxonomic groupings are more ecologically relevant, so they provide an alternative to OTU-based analyses that is consistent and comparable between data sets.",2018,3,10.1128/mSphere.00327-18

Bifidobacterium species are less prone to possessing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes (ARGs) than other taxa that may colonize infants. Given that AMR is a growing public health crisis and ARGs are present in the gut microbiome of humans from early life, this study examines the correlation between a Bifidobacterium-dominated infant gut microbiome and AMR levels, measured by a culture-independent metagenomic approach both in early life and as infants become toddlers. In general, Bifidobacterium dominance is associated with a significant reduction in AMR in a Bangladeshi cohort, both in the number of acquired AMR genes present and in the abundance of AMR genes. However, by year 2, Bangladeshi infants had no significant differences in AMR related to their early-life Bifidobacterium levels. A generalized linear model including all infants in a previously published Swedish cohort found a significant negative association between log-transformed total AMR and Bifidobacterium levels, thus confirming the relationship between Bifidobacterium levels and AMR. In both cohorts, there was no change between early-life and later-life AMR abundance in high-Bifidobacterium infants but a significant reduction in AMR abundance in low-Bifidobacterium infants. These results support the hypothesis that early Bifidobacterium dominance of the infant gut microbiome may help reduce colonization by taxa containing ARGs. IMPORTANCE Infants are vulnerable to an array of infectious diseases, and as the gut microbiome may serve as a reservoir of AMR for pathogens, reducing the levels of AMR in infants is important to infant health. This study demonstrates that high levels of Bifidobacterium are associated with reduced levels of AMR in early life and suggests that probiotic interventions to increase infant Bifidobacterium levels have the potential to reduce AMR in infants. However, this effect is not sustained at year 2 of age in Bangladeshi infants, underscoring the need for more detailed studies of the biogeography and timing of infant AMR acquisition.",2018,3,10.1128/mSphere.00441-18
