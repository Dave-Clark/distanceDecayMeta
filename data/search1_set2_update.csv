Uncertainty remains, however, in what governs the relative contributions of different ecological processes. To help fill this knowledge gap, we test the general hypothesis that both initial state and degree of change in environmental conditions govern the relative contributions of different ecological assembly processes. To do so, we leveraged regional-scale nutrient and organic matter addition experiments and used soil organic matter (SOM) as a proxy of integrated soil environmental conditions. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that both the initial amount of SOM and the degree of change in SOM-in response to nutrient addition-influenced the relative contributions of different ecological assembly processes. These influences were most clearly observed at the regional scale, suggesting potential scale dependence. More specifically, nutrient additions homogenized bacterial community composition due to enhanced influences of homogenizing dispersal when SOM content was initially high. In contrast, nutrient additions led to divergence in community composition due to variable selection when initial SOM was low and/or when SOM increased significantly in response to nutrient additions. Our findings indicate important connections among initial conditions, degree of change in environmental variables and microbial community assembly processes that may influence ecosystem processes. These conceptual inferences highlight a need to strengthen connections between ecological theory and biogeochemical modelling.",2018,27,10.1111/mec.14914

So far, the effects of high salinity on the most abundant marine photoautotrophic organism, Prochlorococcus, in marine oligotrophic environments, are mostly unknown. Here, we report the isolation of a new Prochlorococcus strain (RSP50) belonging to high-light (HL) clade II from the Red Sea, one of the warmest and most saline bodies of water in the global oceans. A comparative genomic analysis identified a set of 59 genes that were exclusive to RSP50 relative to currently available Prochlorococcus genomes, the majority of which (70%) encode for hypothetical proteins of unknown function. However, three of the unique genes encode for a complete pathway for the biosynthesis of the compatible solute glucosylglycerol, and are homologous to enzymes found in the sister lineage Synechococcus. Metatranscriptomic analyses of this metabolic pathway in the water column of the Red Sea revealed that the corresponding genes were constitutively transcribed, independent of depth and light, suggesting that osmoregulation using glucosylglycerol is a general feature of HL II Prochlorococcus in the Red Sea.",2018,94,10.1093/femsec/fiy182

For this reason, it has been proposed as an analogue for Mars, presenting deleterious factors similar to those on the surface of that planet. We evaluated the survival of extremophilic UV-resistant yeasts isolated from a high-elevation area in the Atacama Desert under stratospheric conditions. As biological controls, intrinsically resistant Bacillus subtilis spores were used. Experiments were performed in two independent stratospheric balloon flights and with an environmental simulation chamber. The three following different conditions were evaluated: (i) desiccation, (ii) desiccation plus exposure to stratospheric low pressure and temperature, and (3) desiccation plus exposure to the full stratospheric environment (UV, low pressure, and temperature). Two strains, Naganishia (Cryptococcus) friedmannii 16LV2 and Exophiala sp. strain 15LV1, survived full exposures to the stratosphere in larger numbers than did B. subtilis spores. Holtermanniella watticus (also known as Holtermanniella wattica) 16LV1, however, suffered a substantial loss in viability upon desiccation and did not survive the stratospheric UV exposure. The remarkable resilience of N. friedmannii and Exophiala sp. 15LV1 under the extreme Mars-like conditions of the stratosphere confirms its potential as a eukaryotic model for astrobiology. Additionally, our results with N. friedmannii strengthen the recent hypothesis that yeasts belonging to the Naganishia genus are fit for aerial dispersion, which might account for the observed abundance of this species in high-elevation soils. IMPORTANCE Studies of eukaryotic microorganisms under conditions of astrobiological relevance, as well as the aerial dispersion potential of extremophilic yeasts, are still lacking in the literature compared to works with bacteria. Using stratospheric balloon flights and a simulation chamber, we demonstrate that yeasts isolated from an extreme environment are capable of surviving all stressors found in the stratosphere, including intense UV irradiation, scoring an even higher survival than B. subtilis spores. Notably, the yeast N. friedmannii, which displayed one of the highest tolerances to the stratospheric environment in the experiments, was recently proposed to be adapted to airborne transportation, although such a hypothesis had not yet been tested. Our results strengthen such an assumption and can help explain the observed distribution and ecology of this particular yeast species.",2018,84,10.1128/AEM.01942-18
"Schwob, G; Roy, M; Pozzi, AC; Herrera-Belaroussi, A; Fernandez, MP",In Planta Sporulation of Frankia spp. as a Determinant of Alder-Symbiont Interactions,APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY,"The Alnus genus forms symbiosis with the actinobacteria Frankia spp. and ectomycorrhizal fungi. Two types of Frankia lineages can be distinguished based on their ability to sporulate in planta. Spore-positive (Sp) strains are predominant on Alnus incana and Alnus viridis in highlands, while spore-negative (Sp-) strains are mainly associated with Alnus glutinosa in lowlands. Here, we investigated whether the Sp predominance in nodules is due to host selection of certain Frankia geno types from soil communities or the result of the ecological history of the alder stand soil, as well as the effect of the sporulation genotype on the ectomycorrhizal (ECM) communities. Trapping experiments were conducted using A. glutinosa, A. incana, and A. viridis plantlets on 6 soils, differing in the alder species and the frequency of Sp nodules in the field. Higher diversity of Frankia spp. and variation in Sp frequencies were observed in the trapping than in the fields. Both indigenous and trapping species shape Frankia community structure in trapped nodules. Nodulation impediments were observed under several trapping conditions in Sp soils, supporting a narrower host range of Sp Frankia species. A. incana and A. viridis were able to associate equally with compatible Sp and Sp- strains in the greenhouse. Additionally, no host shift was observed for Alnus-specific ECM, and the sporulation genotype of Frankia spp. defined the ECM communities on the host roots. The symbiotic association is likely determined by the host range, the soil history, and the type of in planta Frankia species. These results provide an insight into the biogeographical drivers of alder symbionts in the Holarctic region. IMPORTANCE Most Frankia-actinorhiza plant symbioses are capable of high rates of nitrogen fixation comparable to those found on legumes. Yet, our understanding of the ecology and distribution of Frankia spp. is still very limited. Several studies have focused on the distribution patterns of Frankia spp., demonstrating a combination of host and pedoclimatic parameters in their biogeography. However, very few have considered the in planta sporulation form of the strain, although it is a unique feature among all symbiotic plant-associated microbes. Compared with Sp- Frankia strains, Sp strains would be obligate symbionts that are highly dependent on the presence of a compatible host species and with lower efficiency in nitrogen fixation. Understanding the biogeographical drivers of Sp Frankia strains might help elucidate the ecological role of in planta sporulation and the extent to which this trait mediates host-partner interactions in the alder-Frankia-ECM fungal symbiosis.",2018,84,10.1128/AEM.01737-18

Here, we survey the biogeography of methanogens across unconventional reservoirs, and report that members of genus Methanohalophilus are recovered from every hydraulically fractured unconventional reservoir sampled by metagenomics. We provide the first genomic sequencing of three isolate genomes, as well as two metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs). Utilizing six other previously sequenced isolate genomes and MAGs, we perform comparative analysis of the 11 genomes representing this genus. This genomic investigation revealed distinctions between surface and subsurface derived genomes that are consistent with constraints encountered in each environment. Genotypic differences were also uncovered between isolate genomes recovered from the same well, suggesting niche partitioning among closely related strains. These genomic substrate utilization predictions were then confirmed by physiological investigation. Fine-scale microdiversity was observed in CRISPR-Cas systems of Methanohalophilus, with genomes from geographically distinct unconventional reservoirs sharing spacers targeting the same viral population.

Interestingly, no consistent taxonomic or biogeographic predictors have been identified. However, an important lesson learned was that there are interactions among host plants, environmental factors, and characters of the pathogens. A logical extension of the predictivity project is to examine the dynamics of resistances when multiple biotic stresses are involved. In this study, we found that populations susceptible to a foliar feeding pest [Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say)] are resistant to a bacterial pathogen [Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum (Jones, 1901; Hauben et al. 1999)]. We propose that wounds caused by the insect pest allow the bacterial pathogen to gain entry and cause disease. This would lead to strong selection pressure for resistance to the bacterial pathogen. Consequently, when searching for traits of interest in germplasm collections, it is important to consider the complex biotic and abiotic environments in which the source populations evolved.",2018,65,10.1007/s10722-018-0682-x

Here, we examined latitudinal variation in the soil biota community associated with the invasive plant Alternanthera philoxeroides and its native congener A. sessilis, and the effects of soil biota community variation on these plants and the beetle Agasicles hygrophila. We characterized the soil bacterial and fungal communities and root-knot nematodes of plant rhizospheres collected from 22 degrees N to 36.6 degrees N in China. Soil biota community structure changed with latitude as a function of climate and soil properties. Root-knot nematode abundance and potential soil fungal pathogen diversity (classified with FUNGuild) decreased with latitude, apparently due to higher soil pH and lower temperatures. A greenhouse experiment and lab bioassay showed native plant mass, seed production, and mass of beetles fed native foliage increased with soil collection latitude. However, there were no latitudinal patterns for the invasive plant. These results suggest that invasive and native plants and, consequently, their herbivores have different responses to latitudinal changes in soil-borne enemies, potentially creating spatial variation in enemy release or biotic resistance. This highlights the importance of linking above- and below-ground multitrophic interactions to explore the role of soil biota in non-native plant invasions with a biogeographic approach.",2018,12,10.1038/s41396-018-0219-5

The biogeography of rhizobia has been well investigated, but little is known about the spatial distribution and community assemblage of NRE. By using high-throughput sequencing, we compared biogeographic patterns of rhizobial and non-rhizobial subcommunities and investigated their bacterial co-occurrence patterns in nodules collected from 50 soybean fields across China. Dispersal probability was lower in NRE than in rhizobia, as revealed by a significant distance-decay relationship found in NRE, but not in rhizobia, in addition to a significant occupancy-abundance relationship in the entire community. Rhizobial and NRE subcommunities were significantly influenced by different environmental and spatial variables. Moreover, the rhizobial subcommunities were grouped into Ensifer- and Bradyrhizobium-dominated clusters that were significantly related to soil pH. The non-rhizobial subcommunities were grouped into Proteobacteria-and Firmicutes-dominated clusters that were more influenced by climatic than by edaphic factors. These results demonstrated that rhizobial and non-rhizobial subcommunities are characterized by distinct biogeographic patterns. Network analysis showed rhizobia and NRE as separately grouped and uncorrelated with each other, suggesting they did not share niche space in soybean nodules. In sum, these results broaden our knowledge of how bacteria are distributed and assemble as a community in root nodules. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We hypothesized that, at the small-scale, co-location of degraders and pollutants in soils may be a prerequisite for efficient biodegradation of these chemicals. In non-co-localized micro-environments, however, diffusive and advective solute transport as well as active transport of microbial degraders towards their corresponding substrate may improve the accessibility of microbial substrates. The objective of this study was to test whether water flow can accelerate microbial pesticide degradation by facilitating the encounter of spatially separated pesticides and bacterial degraders at the millimeter scale. Combining natural and sterilized soil aggregates, we built soil cores with different spatial localizations of the pesticide 2,4-dichIorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and microbial degraders: (i) homogeneous distribution of microorganisms and 2,4-D throughout the soil core, (ii) co-localized microorganisms and 2,4-D in a mm(3) soil location, and iii) separated microorganisms and 2,4-D in two mm(3) soil locations spaced 1 cm apart. Following the fate of C-14 labelled 2,4-D (mineralization, extractable and non-extractable residues) as well as the abundance of bacterial 2,4-D degraders harboring the tfdA gene over an incubation period of 24 days, we observed decreased biodegradation of 2,4-D with increasing spatial separation between substrate and bacterial degraders. We found evidence that advection is a key process controlling the accessibility of 2,4-D and pesticide degraders. Advective solute transport induced leaching of about 50% of the initially applied 2,4-D regardless of initial spatial distribution patterns. Simultaneously, advective transport of 2,4-D and bacterial degraders triggered their re-encounter and compensated for the leaching-induced separation of initially co-localized micro-organisms and 2,4-D. This resulted in effective biodegradation of 2,4-D, comparable to the homogeneous treatment. Similarly, advective transport processes brought substrate and degraders into contact if both were initially separated. Thus, advection more effectively removed bioaccessibility limitations to pesticide degradation than diffusive transport alone. These results emphasize the importance of considering spatial microbial ecology as well as biogeophysics at the mm scale to better understand the fate of pesticides at larger scales in soil.",2018,127,10.1016/j.soilbio.2018.09.024

However, little is known about the environmental factors explaining this for soil methane-oxidising bacteria (or methanotrophs), which play an essential role in ecosystem functioning and climate regulation through mitigation of net CH4 emissions worldwide. This knowledge gap limits the inclusion of taxon-based information to improve predictions of climate change-simulation models. In this study, 697 soil samples were collected across Scotland and 62 climo-edaphic properties were analysed. Combined with a set of hybrid geostatistical modelling approaches, the aim of this study was to investigate the biogeographical distribution (pmoA gene relative abundance) of key methanotrophic operational taxonomic units named Terminal-Restriction Fragments (T-RFs) and of methanotrophic community structure. The main objectives were to: 1) identify major environmental drivers influencing the distribution and composition of methanotrophs; and 2) perform spatial modelling and mapping of soil methanotrophic community assemblage and distribution of those dominant T-RFs. Herein, it was hypothesised that the assemblage of methanotrophic community and distribution of key populations across various landscapes could be predicted using a range of climo-edaphic factors optimised for spatial, climate and terrain attributes. The findings presented here suggest that the distribution of methanotrophs is strongly linked to land use and some edaphic properties, predominantly soil moisture/rainfall, nutrients and metal ions. The hybrid geostatistical approach allowed for spatial prediction of methanotrophic T-RFs and community, and demonstrated a clear niche partitioning between dominant T-RFs. Overall, these results provide novel evidence that the distribution of methanotrophs could be explained and mapped in terms of niche partitioning and predicted at the regional scale.

Near surface interactions between urban waterways and urban air are understudied but some level of interaction among these bacterial communities would be expected and may be relevant to understanding both urban air and water quality. To address this gap related to patterns of local air-water microbial exchange, we utilized next-generation sequencing of 16S rRNA genes from paired air and water samples collected from 3 urban waterfront sites and evaluated their relative bacterial diversity. Aerosol samples at all sites were significantly more diverse than water samples. Only 17-22% of each sites bacterial aerosol OTUs were present at every site. These shared aerosol OTUs included taxa associated with terrestrial systems (e.g., Bacillus), aquatic systems (e.g., Planktomarina) and sewage (e.g., Enterococcus). In fact, sewage-associated genera were detected in both aerosol and water samples, (e.g., Bifidobacterium, Blautia, and Faecalibacterium), demonstrating the widespread influence of similar pollution sources across these urban environments.

Here, we suggest the use of microbial mats as a model of study to reveal patterns that can illuminate the ecological processes underlying microbial dynamics in response to stress. We traced the responses to anthropogenic perturbation caused by water depletion in microbial mats from Cuatro Cienegas Basin (CCB), Mexico, by using a time-series spatially resolved analysis in a novel combination of three computational approaches. First, we implemented MEBS (Multi-genomic Entropy-Based Score) to evaluate the dynamics of major biogeochemical cycles across spatio-temporal scales with a single informative value. Second, we used robust Time Series-Ecological Networks (TS-ENs) to evaluate the total percentage of interactions at different taxonomic levels. Lastly, we utilized network motifs to characterize specific interaction patterns. Our results indicate that microbial mats from CCB contain an enormous taxonomic diversity with at least 100 phyla, mainly represented by members of the rare biosphere (RB). Statistical ecological analyses point out a clear involvement of anaerobic guilds related to sulfur and methane cycles during wet versus dry conditions, where we find an increase in fungi, photosynthetic, and halotolerant taxa. TS-ENs indicate that in wet conditions, there was an equilibrium between cooperation and competition (positive and negative relationships, respectively), while under dry conditions there is an over-representation of negative relationships. Furthermore, most of the keystone taxa of the TS-ENs at family level are members of the RB and the microbial mat core highlighting their crucial role within the community. Our results indicate that microbial mats are more robust to perturbation due to redundant functions that are likely shared among community members in the highly connected TS-ENs with density values close to one (approximate to 0.9). Finally, we provide evidence that suggests that a large taxonomic diversity where all community members interact with each other (low modularity), the presence of permanent of low-abundant taxa, and an increase in competition can be potential buffers against environmental disturbance in microbial mats.",2018,9,10.3389/fmicb.2018.02606

"Li, J; Shen, XZ",An improved neutral community model for temporal observations in microbial communities,ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,"Niche theory and neutral theory propose two alternative mechanisms for explaining the long-term coexistence of species in ecological communities. However, the true dynamic mechanisms of ecological communities likely fall in between these two theories of niches and neutrality. Thus, models reconciling the niche and neutral theories to interpret these mechanisms are of high significance. Using temporal observations of microbial communities, Ofiteru et al. (2010) demonstrated a version of the neutral community model that quantifies the contributions of neutral forces and environmental factors on the population dynamics of species in the community. They use a novel weighted least squares method to estimate the parameters. However, this method estimates compound parameters and the population size cannot be disentangled from the immigration rate, becoming computationally intractable when there are zero values existing in the temporal observations. In the current study, we suggest a new version of the neutral community model, modified from the work of Oficeru et al. that does not suffer from these limitations. We also provide a new method for estimating the parameters for our model, which can resolve the estimates of individual parameters.

To shed light on this issue, we tracked the responses of bacterial communities during an extreme salinization-desalinization cycle.ResultsOur results showed that salinization-up process induced an ecological succession, shifting from a community dominated by Betaproteobacteria to Gammaproteobacteria. Within the desalinization-down process, taxon-specific recovery trajectories varied profoundly, with only Gammaproteobacteria returning to their initial levels, of which Alphaproteobacteria was the most prominent member. The -diversity indices gradually increased at oligosaline environment (0.03 to 3 parts per thousand) and subsequently decreased profoundly at hypersaline condition (10 parts per thousand to 90 parts per thousand). However, the indices did not return to pre-disturbance level along the previous trajectory observed during the desalinization. Approximately half of the original OTUs were not detected during desalinization, suggesting that the seed bank may be damaged by the hypersaline environment.

These holes are self-contained ecosystems that include abundant bacterial life within their sediment and liquid water, and have recently gained the attention of microbial ecologists looking to use cryoconite holes as natural microcosms to study microbial community assembly. Here, we explore the idea that cryoconite holes can be viewed as islands, in the same sense that an island in the ocean is an area of habitat surrounded by a barrier to entry. In the case of a classic oceanic island, the ocean is a barrier between islands, but in the case of cryoconite holes, the ocean is comprised of impermeable solid ice. We test two hypotheses, born out of island biogeographic theory, that can be readily applied to cryoconite hole bacteria. First, we ask to what extent the size of a cryoconite hole is related to the amount of bacterial diversity found within it. Second, we ask to what extent cryoconite holes exhibit distance decay of similarity, meaning that geographically close holes are expected to harbor similar bacterial communities, and distant holes are expected to harbor more different bacterial communities. To test the island size hypothesis, we measured the sizes of cryoconite holes on three glaciers in Antarcticas Taylor Valley and used DNA sequencing to measure diversity of bacterial communities within them. We found that for two of these glaciers, there is a strong relationship between hole size and bacterial phylogenetic diversity, supporting the idea that cryoconite holes on those glaciers are islands. The high biomass dispersing to the third glacier we measured could explain the lack of size-diversity relationship, remaining consistent with island biogeography. To test the distance decay of similarity hypothesis, we used DNA sequence data from several previous studies of cryoconite hole bacteria from across the world. Combined with our Taylor Valley data, those data showed that cryoconite holes have strong spatial structuring at scales of one to several hundred kilometers, also supporting the idea that these dirty holes on glaciers are really islands in the cryosphere.",2018,6,10.3389/fevo.2018.00180

We use both amplicon and deep shotgun metagenomic sequencing of bulk soil and rhizosphere samples collected across distinct biogeographical regions from six continents. Predominant taxa include Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria and Bacteroidetes. The core citrus rhizosphere microbiome comprises Pseudomonas, Agrobacterium, Cupriavidus, Bradyrhizobium, Rhizobium, Mesorhizobium, Burkholderia, Cellvibrio, Sphingomonas, Variovorax and Paraburkholderia, some of which are potential plant beneficial microbes. We also identify over-represented microbial functional traits mediating plant-microbe and microbe-microbe interactions, nutrition acquisition and plant growth promotion in citrus rhizosphere.

We propose that extreme unbalanced nutrient stoichiometry of essential nutrients can be a barrier to microbial immigration over geological timescales. At the oasis in the Cuatro Cienegas Basin in Mexico, nutrient stoichiometric proportions are skewed given the low phosphorus availability in the ecosystem. We show that this endangered oasis can be a model for a lost world. The ancient niche of extreme unbalanced nutrient stoichiometry favoured survival of ancestral microorganisms. This extreme nutrient imbalance persisted due to environmental stability and low extinction rates, generating a diverse and unique bacterial community. Several endemic clades of Bacillus invaded the Cuatro Cienegas region in two geological times, the late Precambrian and the Jurassic. Other lineages of Bacillus, Clostridium and Bacteroidetes migrated into the basin in isolated events.

Stream ecosystems are under high anthropogenic pressure; however, studies have only examined the response of stream communities across large scales over multiple generations. We studied the responses of leaf-associated microbial communities in streams within three European biogeographical regions to chemical stress in a microcosm experiment with multiple cycles of fungicide pollution and resource colonisation. Fungal community composition and the ecosystem function leaf decomposition were measured as response variables. Microbial leaf decomposition showed similar recovery times under environmental levels of fungicide exposure across regions. Initially, the decomposition declined (between 19 and 53%) under fungicide stress and recovered to control levels during the third cycle of pollution and colonisation. Although community composition and its stress response varied between regions, this suggests similar functional community adaptation towards fungicide stress overtime. Genetic, epigenetic and physiological adaptations, as well as species turnover, may have contributed to community adaptation but further studies are required to determine if and to which extent these mechanisms are operating. Overall, our findings provide the first evidence of a similar functional response of microbial leaf decomposition to chemical stress across space and time.",2018,8,10.1038/s41598-018-35397-1

Previous studies have reported that hydroxyapatite has been extensively used to immobilize soil heavy metals, and the grain sizes of amendments affect the bioavailability and geochemical stability of heavy metals. However, it is not clear how soil microbial diversity and community composition in these soils vary with the application of hydroxyapatite. A field study was conducted to determine the effect of different grain sizes of hydroxyapatite on Cu and Cd bioavailability and microbial community composition. Results showed that micro-hydroxyapatite (MAP), nanohydroxyapatite (NAP) and normal hydroxyapatite (AP) increased soil pH and decreased soil exchangeable acid and exchangeable Al. Compared with the control, MAP was the most efficient in decreasing the CaCl2-extractable Cu and Cd by 97.5 and 86.5%, respectively, and exchangeable Cu and Cd by 82.4% and 27.4%, respectively. The soil microbial community composition varied with the amendments of different sizes, and the soil bacterial diversity increased after the amendment applications. Analysis of the network structure showed that fewer operational taxonomic units were enriched or depleted between the MAP- and NAP-amended soils, which explained the similarity between the MAP- and NAP-amended soils. These results suggest that MAP may be the best material for amending heavy metal-contaminated soils when considering immobilization efficiency and soil biological characteristics.",2018,267,10.1016/j.agee.2018.08.017

Like for humans, dysbiosis of the plant-associated microbiota may be a co-causal agent in disease with still obscure eziology. In the last decades, the common reed Phragmites australis has been deeply studied for its disappearance from natural stands, but no clear causative agents have been identified and no laboratory models of such reed die-back syndrome (RDBS) have been developed. In this study, we try to shed light on the RDBS, by comparing the rhizosphere microbiota of five Italian P. australis populations with different degrees of decline. Results obtained showed a biogeographical meaningful pattern of rhizosphere microbiota, coupled with an impact of RDBS. Obtained data allowed to construct a two-steps predictive model which enabled the prediction of the plant health status from the microbiota taxonomic composition, independently from their geographic location.

However, it remains unclear how microbial community diversity and their eco-functions are affected by anthropogenic disturbances rather than natural environmental changes. Here, we explored sediment microbial functional genes dynamics and community interaction networks in Hangzhou Bay (HZB), one of the most severely polluted bays on Chinas eastern coast. The results indicated key microbial functional gene categories, including N, P, S, and aromatic compound metabolism, and stress response, displayed significant spatial dynamics along environmental gradients. Sensitive feedbacks of key functional gene categories to N and P pollutants demonstrated potential impacts of human-induced seawater pollutants to microbial functional capacity. Seawater ammonia and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) was identified as primary drivers in selecting adaptive populations and varying community composition. Network analysis revealed distinct modules that were stimulated in inner or outer bay.

In particular, El Rincon coastal area and the adjacent shelf fronts (38.5-42 degrees S, 58.5-62 degrees W) comprise diverse habitats and hold species of economic and ecological value. So far, studies of the microbial community present at the base of the food web remain scarce. Here, we describe the late winter plankton (5-200 mu m) structure in terms of abundance, biomass, species composition, functional groups, and phycotoxin profiles in surface waters of El Rincon in September 2015. Diatoms are the most abundant and the largest contributors to carbon biomass at most stations. They dominated the coastal and inner-shelf (depths <50 m), while dinoflagellates and small flagellates (<15 mu m) dominated offshore at the middle-shelf waters (depth similar to 100 m). In addition, large (> 20 mu m) heterotrophic protists such as various ciliates and dinoflagellates species were more abundant offshore. Scanning of phycotoxins disclosed that paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) toxins were dominated by gonyautoxins-1/4 (GTX1/4), whereas lipophilic toxins were detected in low abundance, for example, domoic acid (DA). However, a bloom of Pseudo-nitzschia spp. (up to 3.6 x 10(5) cells L-1) was detected at inner-shelf stations. Pectenotoxin-2 (PTX-2) and 13-desmethyl spirolide C (SPX-1) were the most abundant in the field. The PTX-2 cooccurred with Dinophysis spp., mainly D. tnpos, while SPX-1 dominated at middle-shelf stations, where cells of Alexandrium catenella (1 strain) and A. ostenfeldii (3 strains) were isolated. The quantitative PSP profiles of the Alexandrium strains differed significantly from the in situ profiles. Moreover, the three A. ostenfeldii strains produced PSP and additionally, five novel spirolides.

Pathogens have to exquisitely monitor the biogeography of the gastrointestinal tract to find a suitable niche for colonization. To dissect the important metabolic pathways that influence virulence of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC), we conducted a highthroughput screen. We generated a dataset of regulatory pathways that control EHEC virulence expression under anaerobic conditions. This unraveled that the cysteine-responsive regulator, CutR, converges with the YhaO serine import pump and the fatty acid metabolism regulator FadR to optimally control virulence expression in EHEC. CutR activates expression of YhaO to increase activity of the YhaJ transcription factor that has been previously shown to directly activate the EHEC virulence genes. CutR enhances FadL, which is a pump for fatty acids that represses inhibition of virulence expression by FadR, unmasking a feedback mechanism responsive to metabolite fluctuations. Moreover, CutR and FadR also augment murine infection by Citrobacter rodentium, which is a murine pathogen extensively employed as a surrogate animal model for EHEC. This high-throughput approach proved to be a powerful tool tomap the web of cellular circuits that allows an enteric pathogen to monitor the gut environment and adjust the levels of expression of its virulence repertoire toward successful infection of the host.",2018,115,10.1073/pnas.1813451115

Previous studies have placed the ancestral population of the organism in Australia with a single lineage disseminated to Southeast Asia. We have previously characterized B. pseudomallei isolates from New Guinea and the Torres Strait archipelago; remote regions that share paleogeographic ties with Australia. These studies identified regional biogeographical boundaries. In this study, we utilize whole-genome sequencing to reconstruct ancient evolutionary relationships and ascertain correlations between paleogeography and present-day distribution of this bacterium in Australasia. Our results indicate that B. pseudomallei from New Guinea fall into a single Glade within the Australian population. Furthermore, clades from New Guinea are region-specific; an observation possibly linked to limited recent anthropogenic influence in comparison to mainland Australia and Southeast Asia. Isolates from the Torres Strait archipelago were distinct yet scattered among those from mainland Australia. These results provide evidence that the New Guinean and Torres Strait lineages may be remnants of an ancient portion of the Australian population. Rising sea levels isolated New Guinea and the Torres Strait Islands from each other and the Australian mainland, and may have allowed long-term isolated evolution of these lineages, providing support for a theory of microbial biogeography congruent with that of macro flora and fauna.

"Paver, SF; Muratore, D; Newton, RJ; Coleman, ML",Reevaluating the Salty Divide: Phylogenetic Specificity of Transitions between Marine and Freshwater Systems,MSYSTEMS,"Marine and freshwater microbial communities are phylogenetically distinct, and transitions between habitat types are thought to be infrequent. We compared the phylogenetic diversity of marine and freshwater microorganisms and identified specific lineages exhibiting notably high or low similarity between marine and freshwater ecosystems using a meta-analysis of 16S rRNA gene tag-sequencing data sets. As expected, marine and freshwater microbial communities differed in the relative abundance of major phyla and contained habitat-specific lineages. At the same time, and contrary to expectations, many shared taxa were observed in both habitats. Based on several metrics, we found that Gammaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Betaproteobacteria contained the highest number of closely related marine and freshwater sequences, suggesting comparatively recent habitat transitions in these groups. Using the abundant alphaproteobacterial group SAR11 as an example, we found evidence that new lineages, beyond the recognized LD12 Glade, are detected in freshwater at low but reproducible abundances; this evidence extends beyond the 16S rRNA locus to core genes throughout the genome. Our results suggest that shared taxa are numerous, but tend to occur sporadically and at low relative abundance in one habitat type, leading to an underestimation of transition frequency between marine and freshwater habitats. Rare taxa with abundances near or below detection, including lineages that appear to have crossed the salty divide relatively recently, may possess adaptations enabling them to exploit opportunities for niche expansion when environments are disturbed or conditions change. IMPORTANCE The distribution of microbial diversity across environments yields insight into processes that create and maintain this diversity as well as potential to infer how communities will respond to future environmental changes. We integrated data sets from dozens of freshwater lake and marine samples to compare diversity across open water habitats differing in salinity. Our novel combination of sequence-based approaches revealed lineages that likely experienced a recent transition across habitat types. These taxa are promising targets for studying physiological constraints on salinity tolerance. Our findings contribute to understanding the ecological and evolutionary controls on microbial distributions, and open up new questions regarding the plasticity and adaptability of particular lineages.",2018,3,10.1128/mSystems.00232-18

We sought to determine the taxonomic bacterial biogeography of the upper GI tract, including different sites within the human stomach (cardia, corpus, and antrum), adjacent upstream (esophagus) and downstream (duodenum) locations, and luminal contents (aspirate), as well as whole-stomach samples from mice and gerbils. Qualitative and quantitative DNA- and RNA-based taxonomic microbiota analyses were combined to study the relationship of relative and absolute bacterial abundances and transcriptionally active bacterial microbiota components in the stomach of humans and mice. Stomach microbiota compositions resembled those of esophagus and duodenum. However, along the descending GI tract, the relative abundances of specific oropharyngeal commensals decreased (Streptococcus) or increased (Rothia mucilaginosa, Porphyromonas, and Lachnospiraceae). Furthermore, the compositional similarity (weighted UniFrac) between stomach aspirates and esophageal biopsy samples increased with gastric Streptococcus relative abundance. In both human aspirate and mouse stomach samples, Firmicutes were more abundant among transcriptionally active bacteria than Bacteroidetes. The relative abundance of Firmicutes in the stomach was negatively correlated and that of Bacteroidetes was positively correlated with absolute bacterial abundance, suggesting a disproportionate increase of Bacteroidetes over Firmicutes at higher bacterial densities. Human, mouse, and gerbil stomach samples showed similarities at higher taxonomic levels but differences at lower taxonomic levels. Our findings suggest selective enrichment and depletion of specific bacterial taxa in the stomach and Firmicutes being transcriptionally more active than Bacteroidetes that increase in relative abundance with total bacterial load. IMPORTANCE Clinical stomach interventions, such as acid inhibition or bypass surgery, have been linked to fecal microbiota alterations. We demonstrate that the stomach microbiota largely overlaps those of adjacent gastrointestinal locations and identify gradual decreases and increases in the relative abundances of specific bacteria within the stomach, suggesting selective enrichment and depletion. Moreover, similarities between stomach and esophagus samples are proportional to the concentrations of Streptococcus (Firmicutes) in the stomach. The relative abundance of Firmicutes in the stomach, compared to that of Bacteroidetes, is increased in RNA relative to DNA, indicating higher transcriptional activity. Moreover, increased absolute bacterial loads are associated with decreased relative abundance of Firmicutes and higher relative abundance of Bacteroidetes. Our findings characterize the stomach microbiota as influenced by Bacteroidetes influx against a background of transcriptionally more active Firmicutes. Human, mouse, and gerbil stomach microbiotas differ at lower taxonomic levels, which might affect the utility of these model organisms.",2018,3,10.1128/mSystems.00262-18

In addition, distant locations may also lead to biogeographical patterns of microbial communities. Here, we used an undisturbed salt marsh chronosequence spanning over a century of ecosystem development to investigate changes in the community composition and abundance of a set of nitrogen-cycling genes. Specifically, we targeted genes of diazotrophs and ammonia oxidizers associated with the bulk and rhizosphere soil of the plant species Limonium vulgare. Samples were collected across five distinct successional stages of the chronosequence (ranging from 5 to 105years) at two time-points. Our results indicate that soil variables such as sand:silt:clay % content and pH strongly relates to the abundance of N-cycling genes in the bulk soil. However, in the rhizosphere samples, the abundance of ammonia-oxidizing organisms (both bacteria and archaea, AOB and AOA, respectively) was relatively constant across most of the successional stages, albeit displaying seasonal variation. This result indicates a potentially stronger control of plant host (rather than soil) on the abundance of these organisms. Interestingly, the plant host did not have a significant effect on the composition of AOA and AOB communities, being mostly divergent according to soil successional stages. The abundance of diazotrophic communities in rhizosphere samples was more affected by seasonality than those of bulk soil. Moreover, the abundance pattern of diazotrophs in the rhizosphere related to the systematic increase of plant biomass and soil organic matter along the successional gradient. These results suggest a potential season-dependent regulation of diazotrophs exerted by the plant host. Overall, this study contributes to a better understanding of how the natural formation of a soil and host plants influence the compositional and abundance changes of nitrogen-cycling genes in bulk and rhizosphere soil microhabitats.",2018,111,10.1007/s10482-018-1098-5

While highly diverse fungi have been discovered in these marine systems, still, little is known about their seasonality and associated drivers in coastal waters. Here, we examined fungal communities over 3 years of weekly sampling at a dynamic, temperate coastal site (Pivers Island Coastal Observatory [PICO], Beaufort, NC, USA). Fungal 18S rRNA gene abundance, operational taxonomic unit (OTU) richness, and Shannons diversity index values exhibited prominent seasonality. Fungal 18S rRNA gene copies peaked in abundance during the summer and fall, with positive correlations with chlorophyll a, SiO4, and oxygen saturation. Diversity (measured using internal transcribed spacer [ITS] libraries) was highest during winter and lowest during summer; it was linked to temperature, pH, chlorophyll a, insolation, salinity, and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). Fungal communities derived from ITS libraries were dominated throughout the year by Ascomycota, with contributions from Basidiomycota, Chytridiomycota, and Mucoromycotina, and their seasonal patterns linked to water temperature, light, and the carbonate system. Network analysis revealed that while cooccurrence and exclusion existed within fungus networks, exclusion dominated the fungus-and-phytoplankton network, in contrast with reported pathogenic and nutritional interactions between marine phytoplankton and fungi. Compared with the seasonality of bacterial communities in the same samples, the timing, extent, and associated environmental variables for fungi community are unique. These results highlight the fungal seasonal dynamics in coastal water and improve our understanding of the ecology of planktonic fungi. IMPORTANCE Coastal fungal dynamics were long assumed to be due to terrestrial inputs; here, a high-resolution time series reveals strong, repeating annual patterns linked to in situ environmental conditions, arguing for a resident coastal fungal community shaped by environmental factors. These seasonal patterns do, however, differ from those observed in the bacterioplankton at the same site; e.g., fungal diversity peaks in winter, whereas bacterial diversity maxima occur in the spring and fall. While the dynamics of these communities are linked to water temperature and insolation, fungi are also influenced by the carbonate system (pH and DIC). As both fungi and heterotrophic bacteria are thought to be key organic-material metabolizers, differences in their environmental drivers may offer clues as to which group dominates secondary production at this dynamic site. Overall, this study suggests the unique ecological roles of mycoplankton and their potentially broad niche complementarities to other microbial groups in the coastal ocean.",2018,84,10.1128/AEM.00967-18

In some instances, fermented foods provide a rich source of the beneficial microbial communities that could promote gastrointestinal health. The indigenous microbiota that colonize fermentation facilities may impact food quality, food safety, and spoilage risks and maintain the nutritive value of the product. Here, microbiomes within sauerkraut production facilities were profiled to characterize variance across surfaces and to determine the sources of these bacteria. Accordingly, we used high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene in combination with whole-genome shotgun analyses to explore biogeographical patterns of microbial diversity and assembly within the production facility. Our results indicate that raw cabbage and vegetable handling surfaces exhibit more similar microbiomes relative to the fermentation room, processing area, and dry storage surfaces. We identified biomarker bacterial phyla and families that are likely to originate from the raw cabbage and vegetable handling surfaces. Raw cabbage was identified as the main source of bacteria to seed the facility, with human handling contributing a minor source of inoculation. Leuconostoc and Lactobacillaceoe dominated all surfaces where spontaneous fermentation occurs, as these taxa are associated with the process. Wall, floor, ceiling, and barrel surfaces host unique microbial signatures. This study demonstrates that diverse bacterial communities are widely distributed within the production facility and that these communities assemble nonrandomly, depending on the surface type. IMPORTANCE Fermented vegetables play a major role in global food systems and are widely consumed by various global cultures. In this study, we investigated an industrial facility that produces spontaneous fermented sauerkraut without the aid of starter cultures. This provides a unique system to explore and track the origins of an in-house microbiome in an industrial environment. Raw vegetables and the surfaces on which they are handled were identified as the likely source of bacterial communities rather than human contamination. As fermented vegetables increase in popularity on a global scale, understanding their production environment may help maintain quality and safety goals.",2018,84,10.1128/AEM.01680-18

This problem is reduced to determining whether two soil samples test and control have the same origin or source. Here, we propose an algorithm which copes with this problem based on 16S rRNA gene libraries of test and control soil samples and does not rely on OTU clustering. The algorithm first extracts the Library-SPECific sets of sequences (LSPECs) for alternative control libraries and then quantifies signals of LSPECs in a test library. The heavy use of the suffix array approach for sequence comparison accelerates the algorithm significantly. To evaluate the performance of the algorithm, we collected a control set of 29 soil samples and created two test sets (real and simulated), containing mixed, contaminated and extremely small single-source soil samples (last samples resemble forensics probes). We then carried out 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing of total soil DNA isolated from both test and control soil samples. The algorithm successfully identified the origin of all single source soil samples and the compositions of mixed and even low/highly contaminated samples. The algorithm also demonstrated robustness to the increase in control set size from 9 to 29. We believe the proposed algorithm is suitable for identification problems with various degrees of complexity and is flexible enough to manage other molecular markers and microbiological samples from different non-soil sources.",2018,94,10.1016/j.ecolind.2018.06.060

Surprisingly, coordinated patterns in plant, bacterial, and fungal diversity on tropical mountains have not yet been observed, despite the central role of soil microorganisms in terrestrial biogeochemistry and ecology. We studied an Andean transect traversing 3.5 km in elevation to test whether the species diversity and composition of tropical forest plants, soil bacteria, and fungi follow similar biogeographical patterns with shared environmental drivers. We found coordinated changes with elevation in all three groups: species richness declined as elevation increased, and the compositional dissimilarity among communities increased with increased separation in elevation, although changes in plant diversity were larger than in bacteria and fungi. Temperature was the dominant driver of these diversity gradients, with weak influences of edaphic properties, including soil pH. The gradients in microbial diversity were strongly correlated with the activities of enzymes involved in organic matter cycling, and were accompanied by a transition in microbial traits towards slower-growing, oligotrophic taxa at higher elevations. We provide the first evidence of coordinated temperature-driven patterns in the diversity and distribution of three major biotic groups in tropical ecosystems: soil bacteria, fungi, and plants. These findings suggest that interrelated and fundamental patterns of plant and microbial communities with shared environmental drivers occur across landscape scales. These patterns are revealed where soil pH is relatively constant, and have implications for tropical forest communities under future climate change.",2018,99,10.1002/ecy.2482

Smoke from global biomass burning has had significant and widespread ecological and human health consequences, but the living component of smoke has received little attention. Microbes aerosolized and transported by wildland fire may have profound effects on atmospheric and environmental factors, acting as nuclei for ice condensation, transporting pathogens or symbionts, and otherwise influencing ecosystems and human populations downwind. The potential for smoke to aerosolize and transport viable microbes is a virtually blank piece of the microbial biogeography puzzle with far-reaching implications. This study characterized the aerosolization of viable microbes via wildland fire smoke from burns in contrasting coniferous forests. Seventy aerosolized microbial morphotypes were recovered, and of these, a subset was identified using DNA analysis which revealed both pathogenic and non-pathogenic fungal species. Overall microbial colony-forming units decreased with increasing distance from smoke source, driven by bacterial abundance.

This premise remains challenging to test, however, as it requires quantifying the traits of closely related soil bacteria and relating these traits to bacterial abundances and geographic distributions. Here, we sought to investigate whether the widespread soil taxon Curtobacterium consists of multiple coexisting ecotypes with differential geographic distributions. We isolated Curtobacterium strains from six sites along a climate gradient and assayed four functional traits that may contribute to niche partitioning in leaf litter, the top layer of soil. Our results revealed that cultured isolates separated into fine-scale genetic clusters that reflected distinct suites of phenotypic traits, denoting the existence of multiple ecotypes. We then quantified the distribution of Curtobacterium by analysing metagenomic data collected across the gradient over 18 months. Six abundant ecotypes were observed with differential abundances along the gradient, suggesting fine-scale niche partitioning. However, we could not clearly explain observed geographic distributions of ecotypes by relating their traits to environmental variables. Thus, while we can resolve soil bacterial ecotypes, the traits delineating their distinct niches in the environment remain unclear.",2018,20,10.1111/1462-2920.14405

The prokaryotic communities are considered as one of the best indicators of the water quality. However, there are significant gaps in understanding the ecological processes that shape the composition and function of prokaryotic communities in the urban water ecosystems. Here, we investigated the biogeographic distribution of prokaryotic assemblages in water environments including landscape ponds, drinking water reservoirs, influents (IFs) and effluents (EFs) of wastewater treatment plants of a coastal city (Xiamen), China, by using 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing. Our results indicated that the ponds had higher alpha-diversity of prokaryotic communities than those in the reservoirs, while there were significant variations in the community compositions among ponds, reservoirs, IFs and EFs. Moreover, ponds harbored a significantly higher proportion of sewage- and fecal-indicator taxa than those in the reservoirs, suggesting the occurrence of exogenous pollution in the urban ponds. Null model analysis revealed that dispersal limitation was the main ecological processes resulting in the divergence of prokaryotic community compositions between ponds and other environments, while dispersal limitation and variable selection played an essential role in the formation of unique prokaryotic assemblages in the reservoirs. Function predication analysis demonstrated that the ponds shared more similar functional profiles with IFs or EFs (e.g., chemoheterotrophy, fermentation, chlorate reducers, nitrate reduction and respiration) than the reservoirs, whereas dominance of photoautotrophy was observed in the reservoirs. Overall, this study provides a profound insight of the ecological mechanisms underlying the responses of prokaryotic communities in the urban landscape ponds to the anthropogenic disturbances.

Therefore, hypersaline systems have attracted much attention in recent years. In this study, we investigated the protistan diversity and community composition in two natural salt evaporation ponds (27-30% salinity) located in an ancient volcanic crater on the Cape Verde island Sal using high-throughput DNA sequencing. Our study revealed a broad range of protistan taxa and a high taxonomic diversity within the Ciliophora, Dinophyceae, and Chlorophyta. We detected a total of 23 Dinophyceae families, although Dinophyceae were generally considered to be only this diverse in aquatic environments of less than 10% salinity. Moreover, we uncovered a high degree of genetic novelty in this habitat. The mean similarity of all detected OTUs to previously described sequences was only 93.6%. These findings strongly dispute the traditional view that extreme hypersaline environments generally maintain low protistan diversity. A meta-analysis covering our and previously published data from other inland and coastal salt ponds clearly showed that our samples clustered according to salinity and not biogeography. This result further supports the claim that salinity is a major transition boundary for protistan communities, regardless of their biogeographic origin.",2018,22,10.1007/s00792-018-1050-7

While originally constrained by a lack of appropriate analytical tools and sequencing depth, new technologies and computational and statistical algorithms have been developed to handle highly dimensional, next-generation sequencing datasets. Both these tools allow for the robust analysis of structural and distributional patterns of microbiota essential for the understanding of microbial ecology and biogeography. Furthermore, consortia of individual laboratories working on large interdisciplinary research programs, like the Human and Earth Microbiome Projects, have developed standardized protocols for DNA extraction, sequencing pipelines, and bioinformatics. These approaches provide large repositories of publicly available data to serve as references for on-going and future, hypothesis-driven studies to better characterize the roles of microbial communities in diverse ecosystems. In this review, we outline the currently available statistical approaches and tools to aid in statistically powered study designs and analyses. Given what is now known about the enormous diversity and variability of the microbial communities in aquatic and terrestrial habitats, we also discuss practical considerations for sample collection. Due to the extensive advances made in the field of metagenomics over the last decade, rigorous, well replicated, hypothesis-driven studies are: 1) needed, 2) now possible, and 3) essential to make best use of sequencing-based technologies to characterize the roles of microbial communities in the structure and function of diverse ecosystems.",2018,154,10.1016/j.mimet.2018.09.020

Most marine species are believed to have a relatively high dispersal potential, such that both globally distributed and geographically isolated taxa exist. Primary occurrence data for three large, easily identified ciliate species, Parafavella gigantea, Schmidingerella serrata, and Zoothamnium pelagicum, and environmental data drawn from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations World Ocean Atlas were used to estimate each species spatial and environmental distributions using Maxent v3.3.3k. The predictive power of the models was tested with a series of spatial stratification studies, which were evaluated using partial receiver operating characteristic (ROC) statistics. Differences between niches occupied by each taxon were evaluated using background similarity tests. All predictions showed significant ability to anticipate test points. The null hypotheses of niche similarity were rejected in all background similarity tests comparing the niches among the three species. This article provides the first quantitative assessment of environmental conditions associated with three species of ciliates and a first estimate of their spatial distributions in the North Atlantic, which can serve as a benchmark against which to document distributional shifts. These species follow consistent, predictable patterns related to climate and environmental biochemistry; the importance of climatic conditions as regards protist distributions is noteworthy considering the effects of global climate change.",2018,63,10.1002/lno.11003

However, many large rivers worldwide are suffering from dam regulation. Increasing attention has been paid to bacterioplankton communities since they are highly responsive to river alterations and may influence biogeochemical processes. Here, a comprehensive study was conducted in the highly regulated Lancang-Mekong River Basin to address the question of how bacterioplankton communities respond to cascade damming. The results showed that dam constructions increased nutrient concentrations and threatened water quality in cascade reservoirs. Bacterioplankton cell abundance was reduced by damming, and alpha-diversity was inhibited in cascade reservoirs. Fortunately, however, river ecosystems were resilient after the remarkable disturbance caused by damming. Moreover, bacterioplankton community composition was significantly altered by cascade dams, including a shift in the dominant phylum from r-strategists to k-strategists. Meanwhile, according to GeoChip analysis, the functional composition of bacterioplankton was less affected than taxonomic composition. In addition, geographic and environmental features both followed a distance-decay relationship with community and functional composition, but the local environment condition was the dominant driver in the Lancang River. Therefore, the impoundments of cascade dams had significant impacts on bacterioplankton communities and more attention should be paid to the potential ecological consequences of river regulation.",2018,27,10.1111/mec.14870
"Leventhal, GE; Boix, C; Kuechler, U; Enke, TN; Sliwerska, E; Holliger, C; Cordero, OX",Strain-level diversity drives alternative community types in millimetre-scale granular biofilms,NATURE MICROBIOLOGY,"Microbial communities are often highly diverse in their composition, both at a coarse-grained taxonomic level, such as genus, and at a highly resolved level, such as strains, within species. This variability can be driven by either extrinsic factors such as temperature and or by intrinsic ones, for example demographic fluctuations or ecological interactions. The relative contributions of these factors and the taxonomic level at which they influence community composition remain poorly understood, in part because of the difficulty in identifying true community replicates assembled under the same environmental parameters. Here, we address this problem using an activated granular sludge reactor in which millimetre-scale biofilm granules represent true community replicates. Differences in composition are then expected to be driven primarily by biotic factors. Using 142 shotgun metagenomes of single biofilm granules we found that, at the commonly used genus-level resolution, community replicates varied much more in their composition than would be expected from neutral assembly processes. This variation did not translate into any clear partitioning into discrete community types, that is, distinct compositional states, such as enterotypes in the human gut. However, a strong partition into community types did emerge at the strain level for the dominant organism: genotypes of Candidatus Accumulibacter that coexisted in the metacommunity (the reactor) excluded each other within community replicates (granules). Individual granule communities maintained a significant lineage structure, whereby the strain phylogeny of Accumulibacter correlated with the overall composition of the community, indicating a high potential for co-diversification among species and communities. Our results suggest that due to the high functional redundancy and competition between close relatives, alternative community types are most probably observed at the level of recently differentiated genotypes but not at higher orders of genetic resolution.",2018,3,10.1038/s41564-018-0242-3

It can differentially influence mitochondrial bioenergetics, retrograde signalling to the nuclear genome, and anterograde signalling to mitochondria. All these interactions have the potential to alter the frequencies of mtDNA haplotypes (mitotypes) in nature and may impact human health. In a model laboratory system, we fed four diets varying in Protein: Carbohydrate (P:C) ratio (1:2, 1:4, 1:8 and 1:16 P:C) to four homoplasmic Drosophila melanogaster mitotypes (nuclear genome standardised) and assayed their frequency in population cages. When fed a high protein 1:2 P:C diet, the frequency of flies harbouring Alstonville mtDNA increased. In contrast, when fed the high carbohydrate 1:16 P:C food the incidence of flies harbouring Dahomey mtDNA increased. This result, driven by differences in larval development, was generalisable to the replacement of the laboratory diet with fruits having high and low P:C ratios, perturbation of the nuclear genome and changes to the microbiome. Structural modelling and cellular assays suggested a V161L mutation in the ND4 subunit of complex I of Dahomey mtDNA was mildly deleterious, reduced mitochondrial functions, increased oxidative stress and resulted in an increase in larval development time on the 1:2 P:C diet. The 1:16 P:C diet triggered a cascade of changes in both mitotypes. In Dahomey larvae, increased feeding fuelled increased beta-oxidation and the partial bypass of the complex I mutation. Conversely, Alstonville larvae upregulated genes involved with oxidative phosphorylation, increased glycogen metabolism and they were more physically active. We hypothesise that the increased physical activity diverted energy from growth and cell division and thereby slowed development. These data further question the use of mtDNA as an assumed neutral marker in evolutionary and population genetic studies. Moreover, if humans respond similarly, we posit that individuals with specific mtDNA variations may differentially metabolise carbohydrates, which has implications for a variety of diseases including cardiovascular disease, obesity, and perhaps Parkinsons Disease.",2018,14,10.1371/journal.pgen.1007735

However, the effect of slope aspect on arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, a group of functionally important root-associated microorganisms, remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated AM fungal communities in an alpine ecosystem on a northwest-facing slope (NS) and a southeast-facing slope (SS) along a steep environmental gradient. Ecological processes structuring the fungal communities were inferred according to phylogenetic patterns and species abundance distributions. Thirty-two distinct AM fungal virtual taxa (VTs) were identified, predominantly belonging to the genus Glomus. The change of slope aspect from SS to NS recorded a significant decline in AM fungal richness, resulting in a marked loss of Glomus VTs and the dominance of Rhizophagus. Moreover, both taxonomic and phylogenetic composition of AM fungal communities significantly varied between the two slope aspects, this being largely driven by niche partitioning based on microclimate, soil pH and plant species composition. The influence of geographical distance was negligible. AM fungal communities were phylogenetically clustered on SS and random on NS, suggesting that the central process structuring communities shifted from a niche-dominated filter to the combination of competitive exclusion and a niche filter. Similarly, AM fungal species abundance distribution showed the best fit with the Lognormal model on SS and the Zipf-Mandelbrot model on NS, indicating that community dynamics on both slopes were also in accordance with niche-based mechanisms.",2018,126,10.1016/j.soilbio.2018.08.016

We assessed the BC composition of a littoral and two pelagic habitats (euphotic zone and hypolimnion) of Lake Tovel monthly from April 2014 to May 2017 by high-throughput sequencing of the V3-V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene. The three habitats differed in temperature, light, oxygen and hydrology. In particular, the littoral was the most hydrologically unstable because it receives most of the lake inflow, the hypolimnion was the most stable because of its hydrologically sheltered position, and the pelagic euphotic habitat was intermediate. Consequently, we hypothesized different temporal patterns of BC composition for all three habitats according to their environmental differences. We applied PERMANOVA, nonmetric multidimensional scaling and source-sink analysis to characterize BC composition. Overall, BCs were different among habitats with the littoral showing the highest variability and the hypolimnion the highest stability. The BC of rainy 2014 was distinct from the BCs of other years irrespective of the habitats considered. Seasonal differences in BCs were limited to spring, probably linked to meltwater inflow and mixing. Thus, temporal effects related to year and season were linked to the hydrological gradient of habitats. We suggest that despite potential within-lake dispersal of bacterioplankton by water flow and mixing, local environmental conditions played a major role in Lake Tovel, fostering distinct BCs in the three habitats.",2018,27,10.1111/mec.14855

The two dominant Lactobacillus species found in wild mice establish a commensalistic relationship in gastric biofilms when introduced together into germ-free mice in which L. reuteri facilitates colonization of L. taiwanensis. Genomic analysis revealed allopatric diversification in strains of both species that originated from geographically separated locations (Scotland and France). Allopatry of the strains resulted in reduced formation of mixed biofilms in vitro, indicating that interspecies interactions in gastric Lactobacillus-biofilms are the result of an adaptive evolutionary process that occurred in a biogeographical context. In summary, these findings suggest that members within the vertebrate gut microbiota can evolve inter-dependencies through ecological facilitation, which could represent one mechanism by which host-specific bacterial communities assemble across vertebrate species and an explanation for their spatial and biogeographic patterns.",2018,12,10.1038/s41396-018-0211-0

Here, we simultaneously studied the bacterial community structure at two different locations and depths in shelf waters of a coastal upwelling system during an annual cycle. The most noticeable biogeographic patterns observed were seasonality, horizontal homogeneity, and spatial synchrony in bacterial diversity and community structure related with regional upwelling-downwelling dynamics. Water column mixing eventually disrupted bacterial community structure vertical heterogeneity. Our results are consistent with previous temporal studies of marine bacterioplankton in other temperate regions and also suggest a marked influence of regional factors on the bacterial communities inhabiting this coastal upwelling system.

Therefore, they should show little population genetic structure due to high gene flow. Nevertheless, substantial genetic structure has been reported among populations of many taxa. In rotifers, genetic studies have focused on planktonic taxa leaving sessile groups largely unexplored. Here, we used COI gene and ITS region sequences to study genetic structure and delimit cryptic species in two sessile species (Limnias melicerta [32 populations]; L. ceratophylli [21 populations]). Among populations, ITS region sequences were less variable as compared to those of the COI gene (ITS; L. melicerta: 0-3.1% and L. ceratophylli: 0-4.4%; COI; L. melicerta: 0-22.7% and L. ceratophylli: 0-21.7%). Moreover, L. melicerta and L. ceratophylli were not resolved in phylogenetic analyses based on ITS sequences. Thus, we used COI sequences for species delimitation. Bayesian Species Delimitation detected nine putative cryptic species within L. melicerta and four putative cryptic species for L. ceratophylli. The genetic distance in the COI gene was 0-15.4% within cryptic species of L. melicerta and 0.5-0.6% within cryptic species of L. ceratophylli. Among cryptic species, COI genetic distance ranged 8.1-21.9% for L. melicerta and 15.1-21.2% for L. ceratophylli. The correlation between geographic and genetic distance was weak or lacking; thus geographic isolation cannot be considered a strong driver of genetic variation. In addition, geometric morphometric analyses of trophi did not show significant variation among cryptic species. In this study we used a conservative approach for species delimitation, yet we were able to show that species diversity in these sessile rotifers is underestimated.",2018,13,10.1371/journal.pone.0205203
"Li, W; Yuan, YL; Xia, Y; Sun, Y; Miao, YL; Ma, S",A Cross-Scale Neutral Theory Approach to the Influence of Obesity on Community Assembly of Human Gut Microbiome,FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY,"Background: The implications of gut microbiome to obesity have been extensively investigated in recent years although the exact mechanism is still unclear. The question whether or not obesity influences gut microbiome assembly has not been addressed. The question is significant because it is fundamental for investigating the diversity maintenance and stability of gut microbiome, and the latter should hold a key for understanding the etiological implications of gut microbiome to obesity. Methods: In this study, we adopt a dual neutral theory modeling strategy to address this question from both species and community perspectives, with both discrete and continuous neutral theory models. The first neutral theory model we apply is Hubbells neutral theory of biodiversity that has been extensively tested in macro-ecology of plants and animals, and the second we apply is Sloans neutral theory model that was developed particularly for microbial communities based on metagenomic sequencing data. Both the neutral models are complementary to each other and integrated together offering a comprehensive approach to more accurately revealing the possible influence of obesity on gut microbiome assembly. This is not only because the focus of both neutral theory models is different (community vs. species), but also because they adopted two different modeling strategies (discrete vs. continuous). Results: We test both the neutral theory models with datasets from Turnbaugh et al. (2009). Our tests showed that the species abundance distributions of more than 1/2 species (59-69%) in gut microbiome satisfied the prediction of Sloans neutral theory, although at the community level, the number of communities satisfied the Hubbells neutral theory was negligible (2 out of 278). Conclusion: The apparently contradictory findings above suggest that both stochastic neutral effects and deterministic environmental (host) factors play important roles in shaping the assembly and diversity of gut microbiome. Furthermore, obesity may just be one of the host factors, but its influence may not be strong enough to tip the balance between stochastic and deterministic forces that shape the community assembly. Finally, the apparent contradiction from both the neutral theories should not be surprising given that there are still near 30-40% species that do not obey the neutral law.",2018,9,10.3389/fmicb.2018.02320

While bacterioplankton communities in the Baltic Sea are strongly structured by salinity, how MBIs impact the composition and distribution of bacteria is unknown. The exceptional MBI in 2014, which brought saline and oxygenated water into the basins of the central Baltic Sea, enabled the linkage of microbiological investigations to hydrographic and modeling studies of this MBI. Using sequence data of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and 16S rRNA genes (rDNA), we analyzed bacterioplankton community composition in the inflowing water and in the uplifted former bottom water at stations reached by the MBI. Bacterial diversity data were compared with respective data obtained from previous, non-inflow conditions. Changes in bacterial community composition following the 2014 MBI were mainly apparent at the genus level. A number of specific taxa were enriched in the inflowing water, with large changes in the rRNA/rDNA ratios indicating the different activity levels between of the water masses. The relative similarity of the bacterial communities in the inflowing and uplifted waters as well as the results from an inflow-simulating numerical model showed that the inflowing water did not originate directly from the North Sea but mostly from adjacent areas in the Baltic Sea. This suggested that the inflow event led to a series of shifts in Baltic Sea water masses among the Baltic Sea basins and a gradual mixing of the water bodies. Dramatic changes in the bacterial community composition occurred when the bottom-water inflow reached the anoxic, sulfidic deep basins, resulting in an uplifting of the formerly anoxic bacterial community, dominated by Epsilonproteobacteria. Our study of the impact of MBIs on bacterioplankton communities therefore highlights two relevant underlying mechanisms that impact the distribution and possibly also the activities of planktonic bacteria in the Baltic Sea: (1) the successive dilution of inflowing North Sea water with ambient waters and (2) the uplifting of former bottom-water communities to higher water strata.",2018,5,10.3389/fmars.2018.00383

However, the diazotrophs in grassland soils are still far from fully investigated. Particularly, their regional-scale distribution patterns have never been systematically examined. Here, soils (0-5 cm) were sampled from 54 grasslands on the Tibetan Plateau to examine the diazotroph abundance, diversity, and community composition, as well as their distribution patterns and driving factors. The diazotroph abundance was expressed as nifH gene copies, measured using real-time PCR. The diversity and community composition of diazotrophs were analyzed through MiSeq sequencing of nifH genes. The results showed that Cyanobacteria (47.94%) and Proteobacteria (45.20%) dominated the soil diazotroph communities. Most Cyanobacteria were classified as Nostocales which are main components of biological crusts. Rhizobiales, most of which were identified as potential symbiotic diazotrophs, were also abundant in approximately half of the soil samples. The soil diazotroph abundance, diversity, and community composition followed the distribution patterns in line with mean annual precipitation. Moreover, they also showed significant correlations with prokaryotic abundance, plant biomass, vegetation cover, soil pH values, and soil nutrient contents. Among these environmental factors, the soil moisture, organic carbon, available phosphorus, and inorganic nitrogen contents could be the main drivers of diazotroph distribution due to their strong correlations with diazotroph indices. These findings suggest that autotrophic and symbiotic diazotrophs are the predominant nitrogen fixers in Tibetan grassland soils, and highlight the key roles of water and nutrient availability in determining the soil diazotroph distribution on the Tibetan Plateau.

These monophyletic groups are characterized by the gene content of a large sopE-containing prophage. Within this prophage, genome-wide comparison identified several genes overrepresented in strains of Italian origin. This suggests that certain lineages may be characterized by the acquisition of specific accessory genetic markers useful for improving identification of the source in ongoing epidemics.",2018,8,10.1038/s41598-018-33266-5

Consequently, their traits drive community processes with profound effects on global biogeochemistry. Species traits are, however, not necessarily static but respond to environmental changes in order to maintain fitness and may differ with cell size that scales physiological rates. Comprehending such trait characteristics is necessary for a mechanistic understanding of plankton community dynamics and resulting biogeochemical impacts. Here, we used information theory to analyze metatranscriptomes of micro- and nano-dinoflagellate communities in three ecosystems. Measures of gene expression variations were set as a proxy to determine conserved and plastic community traits and the environmental influence on trait changes. Using metabarcoding, we further investigated if communities with a more similar taxon composition also express more similar traits. Our results indicate that plastic community traits mainly arise from membrane vesicle associated processes in all the environments we investigated. A specific environmental influence on trait plasticity was observed to arise from nitrogen availability in both size classes. Species interactions also appeared to be responsible for trait plasticity in the smaller-sized dinoflagellates. Additionally, the smaller-sized dinoflagellate communities are characterized by the expression of a large pool of habitat specific genes despite being taxonomically more similar across the habitats, in contrast to the microplanktonic assemblages that adapted to their environments by changing species composition. Our data highlight the functional diversification on the gene level as a signature of smaller sized dinoflagellates, nitrogen availability and species interactions as drivers of trait plasticity, and traits most likely linked to fitness and community performance.",2018,5,10.3389/fmars.2018.00358

Although aquatic fungal communities respond to pollution, few studies have quantitatively assessed the effect of freshwater contamination on fungal diversity and composition; and knowledge is scarcer for tropical systems. Here we help fill this knowledge gap by studying a heavily-contaminated South American river spanning a biodiversity hotspot. We collected 30 water samples scattered across a quality gradient over two seasons and analyzed them using Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphisms (T-RFLP) coupled with 454 Pyrosequencing. Using T-RFLP we identified 451 and 442 Operational Taxonomy Units (OTUs) in the dry and rainy seasons respectively, whereas Pyrosequencing revealed 48,553 OTUs from which 11% were shared between seasons. Although 68% of all identified OTUs and 51% of all identified phyla remained unidentified, dominant fungal phyla included the Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Chytridiomycota, Glomeromycota, Zygomycota and Neocallimastigomycota, while Calcarisporiella, Didymosphaeria, Mycosphaerella (Ascomycota) and Rhodotorula (Basidiomycota) were the most abundant genera. Fungal diversity was affected by pH and dissolved iron, while community composition was influenced by dissolved oxygen, pH, nitrate, biological oxygen demand, total aluminum, total organic carbon, total iron and seasonality. The presence of potentially pathogenic species was associated with high pH. Furthermore, geographic distance was positively associated with community dissimilarity, suggesting that local conditions allowed divergence among fungal communities. Overall, our findings raise potential concerns for human health and the functioning of tropical river ecosystems and they call for improved water sanitation systems.",2018,8,10.1038/s41598-018-33162-y

"Ma, ZS",DAR (diversity-area relationship): Extending classic SAR (species-area relationship) for biodiversity and biogeography analyses,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,"I extend the classic SAR, which has achieved status of ecological law and plays a critical role in global biodiversity and biogeography analyses, to general DAR (diversity-area relationship). The extension was aimed to remedy a serious application limitation of the traditional SAR that only addressed one aspect of biodiversity scaling-species richness scaling over space, but ignoring species abundance information. The extension was further inspired by a recent consensus that Hill numbers offer the most appropriate measures for alpha-diversity and multiplicative beta-diversity. In particular, Hill numbers are essentially a series of Renyis entropy values weighted differently along the rare-common-dominant spectrum of species abundance distribution and are in the units of effective number of species (or species equivalents such as OTUs). I therefore postulate that Hill numbers should follow the same or similar law of the traditional SAR. I test the postulation with the American gut microbiome project (AGP) dataset of 1,473 healthy North American individuals. I further propose three new concepts and develop their statistical estimation formulae based on the new DAR extension, including: (i) DAR profile-z-q relationship (DAR scaling parameter z at different diversity order q), (ii) PDO (pair-wise diversity overlap) profile-g-q relationship (PDO parameter g at order q, and (iii) MAD (maximal accrual diversity: D-max) profile-D-max-q.

Taxa-area relationships (TARs) have been intensively examined, but the effects of temperature on TARs, particularly for microbial communities, are largely undocumented. Here we present a continental-scale description of temperature-dependent nested TARs of microbial communities (bacteria and archaea) from soils of six forest sites spanning a temperature gradient from subalpine Colorado to tropical Panama. Our results revealed that spatial scaling rates (z-values) of microbial communities varied with both taxonomic resolutions and phylogenetic groups. Additionally, microbial TAR z-values increased with temperature (r = 0.739, P < 0.05), but were not correlated with other environmental variables tested (P > 0.05), indicating that microbial spatial scaling rate is temperature-dependent.

This community is shaped by complex interacting forces, including microbial dispersal from surrounding environments and in-stream selection. However, how the processes structuring stream communities change over space and time remains poorly understood. In this study, we characterize spatial and temporal trends in microbial community composition throughout a stream network spanning first through fifth order streams. We found that the microbial communities of headwater streams are compositionally diverse, with low representation of freshwater microbial taxa and high representation of soil and sediment-associated taxa. In three out of five seasonal samplings, a successional pattern was identified in which phylotype richness and compositional heterogeneity decreased while the proportion of known freshwater taxa increased with increasing cumulative upstream dendritic distance. However, in two samplings, streams instead exhibited uniformly high microbial diversity across the watershed, and the fraction of freshwater taxa showed no relationship with dendritic distance. Overall, our data suggest that the successional processes that drive microbial diversity in streams are highly dynamic and can be disrupted at landscape scales, potentially in response to variation in temperature and precipitation.",2018,20,10.1111/1462-2920.14311

This is especially true of microorganisms, many of which may evolve in step with warming, including phytoplankton, the diverse photosynthetic microbes forming the foundation of most aquatic food webs. Here we tested the capacity of a globally important, model marine diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana, for rapid evolution in response to temperature. Selection at 16 and 31 degrees C for 350 generations led to significant divergence in several temperature response traits, demonstrating local adaptation and the existence of trade-offs associated with adaptation to different temperatures. In contrast, competitive ability for nitrogen (commonly limiting in marine systems), measured after 450 generations of temperature selection, did not diverge in a systematic way between temperatures.

Yet, basic knowledge about their species composition and community assembly is lacking. Here, we begin to fill this knowledge gap by performing the first large-scale survey of microalgal diversity in acidic geothermal sites across the West Pacific Island Chain. We collected 72 environmental samples in 12 geothermal sites, measured temperature and pH, and performed rbcL amplicon-based 454 pyrosequencing. Using these data, we estimated the diversity of microalgal species, and then examined the relative contribution of contemporary selection (i.e., local environmental variables) and dispersal limitation on the assembly of these communities. A species delimitation analysis uncovered seven major microalgae (fourred, two green, and one diatom) and higher species diversity than previously appreciated. A distance-based redundancy analysis with variation partitioning revealed that dispersal limitation has a greater influence on the community assembly of microalgae than contemporary selection. Consistent with this finding, community similarity among the sampled sites decayed more quickly over geographical distance than differences in environmental factors. Our work paves the way for future studies to understand the ecology and biogeography of microalgae in extreme habitats.",2018,54,10.1111/jpy.12771

The aim of this study is to analyze the occurrence and diversity of phages in the North Sea, considering the virus-host interactions and biogeographic factors. The virus community of four sampling stations were described using virus metagenomics (viromes). The results show that the virus community was not evenly distributed throughout the North Sea. The dominant phage members were identified as unclassified phage group, followed by Caudovirales order. Myoviridae was the dominant phage family in the North Sea, which occurrence decreased from the coast to the open sea. In contrast, the occurrence of Podoviridae increased and the occurrence of Siphoviridae was low throughout the North Sea. The occurrence of other groups such as Phycodnaviridae decreased from the coast to the open sea. The coastal virus community was genetically more diverse than the open sea community. The influence of riverine inflow and currents, for instance the English Channel flow affects the genetic virus diversity with the community carrying genes from a variety of metabolic pathways and other functions.

We hypothesized that abiotic and/or biotic interactions are probably more important for explaining the distribution patterns of marine bacterioplankton than environmental filtering. In this study, surface seawater samples were collected about 7000 miles from the Mediterranean Sea, transecting the North Atlantic Ocean, to the Brazilian marginal sea. In bacterial biosphere, SAR11, SAR86, Rhodobacteraceae, and Rhodospiriaceae were predominant in the Mediterranean Sea; Prochlorococcus was more frequent in Atlantic Ocean: whereas in the Brazilian coastal sea, the main bacterial members were Synechococcus and SAR11. With respect to archaea, Eloyarchaeota were predominant in the Atlantic Ocean and Thaumarchaeota in the Mediterranean Sea. With respect to the eukaryotes, Syndiniales, Spumellaria, Ciyomonadida, and Chlorodendrales were predominant in the open ocean, while diatoms and microzooplankton were dominant in the coastal sea. Distinct clusters of prokaryotes and eukaryotes displayed clear spatial heterogeneity. Among the environmental parameters measured, temperature and salinity were key factors controlling bacterial and archaeal community structure, respectively, whereas N/P/Si contributed to eukaryotic variation. The relative contribution of environmental parameters to the microbial distribution pattern was 45.2%. Interaction analysis showed that Gammaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, and 1.7avobacteriia were the keystone taxa within the positive-correlation network, while Thermoplasmata was the main contributor in the negativecorrelation network.

However, the origination and development of antibiotics has yet to be explicitly investigated. Due to diverse structures and similar biosynthesis, glycosylated polyene macrolides (gPEMs) were chosen to explore antibiotic evolution. A total of 130 candidate and 38 transitional gPEM clusters were collected from actinomycetes genomes, providing abundant references for phenotypic gaps in gPEM evolution. The most conserved parts of gPEM biosynthesis were found and used for phylogeny construction. On this basis, we proposed ancestral gPEM clusters at different evolutionary stages and interpreted the possible evolutionary histories in detail. The results revealed that gPEMs evolved from small rings to large rings and continuously increased structural diversity through acquiring, discarding and exchanging genes from different evolutionary origins, as well as co-evolution of functionally related proteins. The combination of horizontal gene transfers, environmental effects and host preference resulted in the diversity and worldwide distribution of gPEMs. This study is not only a useful exploration on antibiotic evolution but also an inspiration for diversity and biogeographic investigations on antibiotics in the era of Big Data.",2018,127,10.1016/j.ympev.2018.06.005

In this paper, we utilize a biogeography database summarizing data on AMF species distribution linked to geographic and environmental conditions to describe global distribution patterns and interpret these patterns within a phylogenetic perspective. The data were obtained from accessions in living culture collections (INVAM, CICG), species descriptions, and other published literature from 1960 to 2012. The database contains 7105 records, 6396 of them from 768 published papers and the remaining 709 from culture accessions. Glomeromycotan species were recorded in all seven continents, 87 countries, 11 biogeographical realms, and 14 biomes. The distribution of families differed among climatic zones and continents, but they. together with all genera, appear to be cosmopolitan. Distribution of AMF species shows a slight decrease from low to high latitudes, but this decrease is steeper in the southern than in the northern hemisphere. A total of 189 species is shared between ancient supercontinents Gondwana and Laurasia and 78 species are common to all climatic zones. Ninety five species (43% of the total) have known cosmopolitan distribution, including members of all genera except Redeckera. Some species have disjunct distribution and 26% of species have been registered from only one continent.

Denitrification (DNF) has been widely studied, but assimilatory nitrate reduction (ANR) and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) have received much less attention. Their ecological patterns and responsible microbes are poorly understood. Here, we studied the structure and function succession of the three functional groups in the middle route of the South-to-NorthWater Diversion Project, which is a 1230 km canal spanning 8 degrees of latitude. The results reflected a nitrogen-removing pattern dominated by DNF in the summer and a nitrogen-retaining pattern dominated by ANR and DNRA in the winter. Stenotrophomonas, a typical denitrifier, was the keystone species in the summer and contributed to N2O production. Clostridium, a genus able to conduct ANR and DNRA, was the keystone species in the winter. Notably, a significant zonation pattern was discovered. According to the community structure, the system could be separated into two biogeographic zones, and the Yellow River (about latitude 35 degrees N) is an important cut-off line. This bacterial biogeography followed differentwater characteristics and ecological processes. ANR was found to be an important process and seasonally transformed its habitat from the northern zone to the southern zone. DNRA bacteria were acclimated to the northern zone and favored at this region in both seasons. The generation of N2O, a strong greenhouse gas, also exhibited this zonation pattern. This is the first study to consider assimilatory and dissimilatory nitrate reducers together at a molecular level, and provides new insights into the underlying patterns of a nitrate-reducing bacterioplankton community.

"Azovsky, AI",Robustness of relative diversity metrics to inventory incompleteness: Could we estimate the near imponderable?,GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY,"Aim Relative diversity metrics (RDMs), such as local : global or regional : global diversity ratios and percentage of endemics, are widely applied in biodiversity studies. This approach, however, is flawed because the real global diversity of many taxa is still largely unknown, especially for rare species. This potential inconsistency of RDMs has not been proved (or disproved) thus far. Here, I use simulation models to explore the efficiency of RDM estimations from incomplete inventories. Location Methods World-wide. Three simple models of species distribution were used: (a) the everything is everywhere model (unlimited dispersal, i.e., equal probability for a species to occur at every point); (b) the environmental selection model (each species can occupy only a portion of randomly distributed suitable localities according to its ecological preferences); and (c) the endemicity model (most species are restricted to a few regions each). To parameterize these models, the world-wide datasets on ciliates, flagellates and harpacticoid copepods were used. The RDMs were estimated by simulating equal-effort sampling and by varying the full number of species and number of sampled individuals per cell. Results Main conclusions Estimated species richness at any scale was heavily influenced by the sampling effort and was greatly underestimated with small sample sizes. The estimated RDM values also depended on the sampling effort (being either upward or downward biased) but were only slightly influenced by the unrecorded part of real global diversity (ignorance). The predictions of the first two models were generally close to each other but differed noticeably from those of the third model. The relative metrics, albeit influenced by undersampling, are nevertheless more robust to inventory incompleteness than absolute measures and can therefore be a reliable tool in comparative biodiversity studies, even if the true number of species cannot be estimated overall. Their estimated values, however, must be interpreted with caution.",2018,27,10.1111/geb.12777

In Central America, the main vector is Triatoma dimidiata, an opportunistic blood meal feeder inhabiting both domestic and sylvatic ecotopes. Given the diversity of interacting biological agents involved in the epidemiology of Chagas disease, having simultaneous information on the dynamics of the parasite, vector, the gut micro biome of the vector, and the blood meal source would facilitate identifying key biotic factors associated with the risk of T. cruzi transmission. In this study, we developed a RADseq-based analysis pipeline to study mixed-species DNA extracted from T. dimidiata abdomens. To evaluate the efficacy of the method across spatial scales, we used a nested spatial sampling design that spanned from individual villages within Guatemala to major biogeographic regions of Central America. Information from each biotic source was distinguished with bioinformatics tools and used to evaluate the prevalence of T. cruzi infection and predominant Discrete Typing Units (DTUs) in the region, the population genetic structure of T. dimidiata, gut microbial diversity, and the blood meal history. An average of 3.25 million reads per specimen were obtained, with approximately 1% assigned to the parasite, 20% to the vector, 11% to bacteria, and 4% to putative blood meals. Using a total of 6,405 T. cruzi SNPs, we detected nine infected vectors harboring two distinct DTUs: Tcl and a second unidentified strain, possibly TcIV. Vector specimens were sufficiently variable for population genomic analyses, with a total of 25,710 T. dimidiata SNPs across all samples that were sufficient to detect geographic genetic structure at both local and regional scales. We observed a diverse microbiotic community, with significantly higher bacterial species richness in infected T. dimidiata abdomens than those that were not infected. Unifrac analysis suggests a common assemblage of bacteria associated with infection, which co-occurs with the typical gut microbial community derived from the local environment. We identified vertebrate blood meals from five T. dimidiata abdomens, including chicken, dog, duck and human; however, additional detection methods would be necessary to confidently identify blood meal sources from most specimens.

In response to environmental changes between seasons, especially the dramatic changes of temperature and nutrient (NO2-N and PO4-P) levels, Synechococcus and unclassified genera in Family I predominated in summer while some oligotrophic taxa (e.g., Pelagibacter, OM43 Glade) are more abundant in winter. The spatial heterogeneity and overall patchiness of bacterial assemblages in the Bohai Strait could not be well explained by the measured factors. However, the taxa with the most spatially variable presence and absence, e.g. Vibrionaceae, SAR11 and Sva0996 marine group, possess differentiated niches for utilization of organic matter (OM) and display a close relationship with the distribution of OM sources in this area, which may indicate the significance of OM sources to bacterial community structure.

We measured routine metabolism in two hydrothermal vent gastropods, Alviniconcha marisindica (n = 40) and the scaly-foot gastropod Chrysomallon squamiferum (n = 18), from Kairei and Edmond vent fields on the Central Indian Ridge (23-25 degrees S, about 3000 meter depth). No previous studies have measured metabolism in any Indian Ocean vent animals. After recovering healthy animals to the surface, we performed shipboard closed-chamber respirometry experiments to compare oxygen uptake at different temperatures (10, 16, and 25 degrees C) at surface pressure (1 atm). The physiology of these species is driven by the demands of their chemoautotrophic symbionts. Chrysomallon has very enlarged respiratory and circulatory systems, and endosymbionts are housed in its trophosome-like internal esophageal gland. By contrast, Alviniconcha has chemoautotrophic bacteria within the gill and less extensive associated anatomical adaptations. Thus, we predicted that routine oxygen consumption of Chrysomallon might be higher than that of Alviniconcha. However, oxygen consumption of Chrysomallon was not higher than that of Alviniconcha, and, further, Chrysomallon maintained a steady metabolic demand in two widely separated experimental temperatures, while Alviniconcha did not. We interpret that these findings indicate that (1) the trophosome does not fundamentally increase oxygen requirement compared to other gastropod holobionts, and (2) cold temperatures (10 degrees C) induce a stress response in Alviniconcha, resulting in aberrantly high uptake. While these two large gastropod species co-occur, differences in oxygen consumption may reflect the separate niches they occupy in the vent ecosystem.",2018,235,10.1086/699326

Spatial patterns have been detected in planktonic bacterial communities at distances <20 m, but little is known about the occurrence of similar variation for other microbial groups and changes in microbial meta-community assembly at different levels of a meta-community. To examine this variation, the biofilm of eight saline ponds were used to investigate processes shaping diversity within ponds (beta) and between ponds (delta). Bacterial and ciliate communities were assessed using ARISA and T-RFLP respectively, while diversity partitioning methods were used to examine the importance of taxonomic turnover and variation partitioning was used to distinguish spatial from environmental determinants. The results show that turnover is important for determining beta- and delta-diversity of biofilms. Spatial factors are important drivers of bacterial beta-diversity but were unimportant for ciliate beta-diversity. Environmental variation was a strong determinant of bacterial and ciliate delta-diversity, suggesting sorting processes are important for assembling pond communities. Determinants of diversity in bacteria are not universal for ciliates, suggesting higher functional redundancy of bacteria or the greater niche breadth of ciliates may be important in discriminating assembly processes between the two organisms.",2018,94,10.1093/femsec/fiy148

The three targeted uncultured taxa (MAST-4, MAST-7 and MAST-1C) were found in virtually all samples from several ocean basins (Atlantic, Indian and Pacific) in fairly constant cell abundances, following typical lognormal distributions. Their global abundances averaged 49, 23 and 7 cells ml(-1), respectively, and altogether the three groups accounted for about 10%-20% of heterotrophic picoeukaryotes. Our innovative high-throughput cell counting routine allows for the first time a direct assessment of the biogeographic distribution of small protists (< 5 mu m) and shows the ubiquity in sunlit oceans of three bacterivorous taxa, suggesting their key roles in marine ecosystems.",2018,20,10.1111/1462-2920.14408

The wide spectrum of facies includes deposits of both photic zone (with fusulinids, algae, relicts of microbial and coral reefs) and deeper dysphotic areas (with trilobites, deep-water tentaculitids and ostracods). The results obtained suggest that there were at least three periods of carbonate platform sedimentation during the latest Silurian(?) to Permian. The Late Silurian?-Devonian biota do not show biogeographical differentiation, but rather are distributed globally. Shallow-water foraminifera and some algae of early Pennsylvanian-basal Cisuralian age belong to the warm-water province. These forms are unknown in the Moscovian-Permian of the Boreal Realm (Taimyr, New Siberian Islands, Verkhoyanie, Omolon Massif) but are typical for Alaska and Arctic Canada, Wrangel Island, Chukotka, Polar Urals and Svalbard. The disappearance of warm-water biota during late Artinskian-Kungurian times led to a subsequent predominance of smaller foraminifera: this assemblage with Protonodosaria is widely distributed in Permian deposits of Novaya Zemlya, Urals, Barents Sea and the eastern Arctic. The warm-water Bashkirian-Asselian biota suggests that the Mendeleev-Chukotka-Wrangel block was a low latitude shallow basin with predominant carbonate sedimentation, being part of the Arctida supercontinent, connected temporarily with the eastern margin of Laurasia (Chukcha-Alaska block).",2018,120,10.1016/j.jog.2018.05.001

We sampled in the Pearl River Estuary (PRE) to examine potential differences in the taxonomic composition of resident (DNA-based) and active (RNA-based) bacterioplankton communities in free-living and particle-associated fractions. MiSeq sequencing data showed that the overall bacterial diversity in particle-associated fractions was higher than in free-living communities. Further in-depth analyses of the sequences revealed a positive correlation between resident and active bacterioplankton communities for the particle-associated fraction but not in the fire-living fraction. However, a large overlapping of OTUs between fire-living and particle-associated communities in PRE suggested that the two fractions may be actively exchanged. We also observed that the positive correlation between resident and active communities is more prominent among the abundant OTUs (relative abundance > 0.2%). Further, the results from the present study indicated that low-abundance bacterioplankton make an important contribution towards the metabolic activity in PRE.",2018,76,10.1007/s00248-018-1174-4

Bromopyrrole alkaloids constitute a typical class of secondary metabolites isolated from sponges that very often display biological activities. Bromine incorporation into secondary metabolites can be catalyzed by either halogenases or haloperoxidases. The diversity of the metagenomes of sponge holobiont species containing bromopyrrole alkaloids (Agelas spp. and Tedania brasiliensis) as well as holobionts devoid of bromopyrrole alkaloids spanning in a vast biogeographic region (approx. Seven thousand km) was studied. The origin and specificity of the detected halogenases was also investigated. The holobionts Agelas spp. and T brasiliensis did not share microbial halogenases, suggesting a species-specific pattern. Bacteria of diverse phylogenetic origins encoding halogenase genes were found to be more abundant in bromopyrrole-containing sponges. The sponge holobionts (e.g., Agelas spp.) with the greatest number of sequences related to clustered, interspaced, short, palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) exhibited the fewest phage halogenases, suggesting a possible mechanism of protection from phage infection by the sponge host. This study highlights the potential of phages to transport halogenases horizontally across host sponges, particularly in more permissive holobiont hosts, such as Tedania spp.",2018,76,10.1007/s00248-018-1172-6

Limited data are available on the composition and structure of bacterial communities (BCs) associated with Phormidium biofilms despite the important role they potentially play in biofilm functioning. By using a high-throughput sequencing approach, we compared the BCs associated with Phormidium biofilms in several sampling sites of the Tarn River (France) and in eight New Zealand rivers. The structure of the BCs from both countries displayed spatial and temporal variations but were well conserved at the order level and 28% of the OTUs containing 90% of the reads were shared by these BCs. This suggests that micro-environmental conditions occurring within thick Phormidium biofilms strongly shape the associated BCs. A strong and significant distance-decay relationship (r(p) = 0.7; P = 0.001) was found in BCs from New Zealand rivers but the Bray-Curtis dissimilarities between French and New Zealand BCs are in the same order of magnitude of those found between New Zealand BCs.

However, it is not well understood how community structure, including its richness, mass, and composition, influences soil functions. We investigated the relationships between soil productivity and microbial communities in unfertilized arable soils extending over 1000 km in eastern Japan. Soil properties, including C turnover rate, N mineralization rate, microbial C, and various soil chemical properties, were measured. Soil bacterial and fungal communities were analyzed by Illuminas MiSeq using 16S rRNA and ITS regions. In addition, root microbial communities from maize grown in each soil were also investigated. Soil bacterial communities shared many operational taxonomic units (OTUs) among farms. An ordination plot based on correspondence analysis revealed convergent distribution of soil bacterial communities across the farms, which seemed to be a result of similar agricultural management practices. Although fungal communities showed lower richness and a lower proportion of shared OTUs than bacterial communities, community structure between the farms tended to be convergent. On the other hand, root communities had lower richness and a higher abundance of specific taxa than the soil communities. Two soil functions, decomposition activity and soil productivity, were extracted by principal component analysis (PCA) based on eight soil properties. Soil productivity correlated with N mineralization rate, P2O5, and maize growth, but not with decomposition activity, which is characterized by C turnover rate, soil organic C, and microbial mass. Soil productivity showed a significant association with community composition, but not with richness and mass of soil microbial communities. Soil productivity also correlated with the abundance of several specific taxa, both in bacteria and fungi. Root communities did not show any clear correlations with soil productivity. These results demonstrate that community composition and abundance of soil microbial communities play important roles in determining soil productivity.",2018,13,10.1371/journal.pone.0204085

While these iconic birds have been intensely studied, the composition of their gut microbiome and the factors influencing it, including host species, diet, and biogeography, has not yet been explored. Results: We characterized the microbial community associated with 12 species of Darwins finches using high-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing of fecal samples from 114 individuals across nine islands, including the unusual blood-feeding vampire finch (Geospiza septentrionalis) from Darwin and Wolf Islands. The phylum-level core gut microbiome for Darwins finches included the Firmicutes, Gammaproteobacteria, and Actinobacteria, with members of the Bacteroidetes at conspicuously low abundance. The gut microbiome was surprisingly well conserved across the diversity of finch species, with one exception-the vampire finch-which harbored bacteria that were either absent or extremely rare in other finches, including Fusobacterium, Cetobacterium, Ureaplasma, Mucispirillum, Campylobacter, and various members of the Clostridia-bacteria known from the guts of carnivorous birds and reptiles. Complementary stable isotope analysis of feathers revealed exceptionally high delta N-15 isotope values in the vampire finch, resembling top marine predators. The Galapagos archipelago is also known for extreme wet and dry seasons, and we observed a significant seasonal shift in the gut microbial community of five additional finch species sampled during both seasons. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the overall conservatism of the finch gut microbiome over short (< 1 Ma) divergence timescales, except in the most extreme case of dietary specialization, and elevates the evolutionary importance of seasonal shifts in driving not only species adaptation, but also gut microbiome composition.",2018,6,10.1186/s40168-018-0555-8

Although many techniques have been developed to solve this problem, it is still challenging to identify the model parameters accurately and reliably. To improve parameters identification of different photovoltaic models, a multiple learning backtracking search algorithm (MLBSA) is proposed in this paper. In MLBSA, some individuals learn from the current population information and historical population information simultaneously, which aims to maintain population diversity and enhance the exploration ability. While other individuals learn from the best individual of current population to improve the convergence speed and thus enhance the exploitation ability. In addition, an elite strategy based on chaotic local search is developed to further refine the quality of current population. The proposed MLBSA is employed to solve the parameters identification problems of different photovoltaic models, i.e., single diode, double diode, and photovoltaic module.

In Brazil, however, the role of bats in the natural cycle of these agents is poorly investigated and generally neglected. In order to analyze the participation of bats in the epidemiology of diseases caused by Bartonella, Coxiella, Rickettsia, Anaplasma and Ehrlichia, we conducted a descriptive epidemiological study in three biogeographic regions of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Results: Tissues of 119 bats captured in preserved areas in the states of Rio de Janeiro, Bahia and Santa Catarina from 2014 to 2015 were submitted to molecular analysis using specific primers. Bartonella spp. was detected in 22 spleen samples (18.5%, 95% CI: 11.9-26.6), whose phylogenetic analysis revealed the generation of at least two independent clusters, suggesting that these may be new unique genotypes of Bartonella species. In addition, four samples (3.4%, 95% CI: 0.9-8.3) were positive for the htpAB gene of C. burnetii [spleen (2), liver (1) and heart (1)]. Rickettsia spp., Anaplasma and Ehrlichia were not identified.

The biogeography of morphological, functional, and life-history traits of marine diatoms were investigated in Arctic and Atlantic waters of the Labrador Sea during the spring bloom (2013-2014). In this study, trait-based analysis using community-weighted means showed that low temperatures (<0 degrees C) in Arctic waters correlated positively with diatom species that have traits such as low temperature optimum growth and the ability to produced ice-binding proteins, highlighting their sea ice origin. High silicate concentrations in Arctic waters, as well as sea ice cover and shallow bathymetry, favoured diatom species that were heavily silicified, colonial and capable of producing resting spores, suggesting that these are important traits for this community. In Atlantic waters, diatom species with large surface area to volume ratios were dominant in deep mixed layers, whilst low silicate to nitrate ratios correlated positively with weakly silicified species. Sharp cell projections, such as processes or spines, were positively correlated with water-column stratification, indicating that these traits promote positive buoyancy for diatom cells. Our trait-based analysis directly links cell morphology and physiology with diatom species distribution, allowing new insights on how this method can potentially be applied to explain ecophysiology and shifting biogeographical distributions in a warming climate.",2018,5,10.3389/fmars.2018.00297

An oceanic mesoscale dipole consists of a cyclonic eddy and an anticyclonic eddy. Dipoles occur frequently in the ocean and usually last from a few days to several months; they have significant impacts on local and global oceanic biological, ecological, and geochemical processes. To better understand how dipoles shape microbial communities, we examined depth-resolved distributions of microbial communities across a dipole in the South China Sea. Our data demonstrated that the dipole had a substantial influence on microbial distributions, community structure, and functional groups both vertically and horizontally. Large alpha and beta diversity differences were observed between anticyclonic and cyclonic eddies in surface and subsurface layers, consistent with distribution changes of major bacterial groups in the dipole. The dipole created uplift, downward transport, enrichment, depletion, and horizontal transport effects. We also found that the edge of the dipole might induce strong subduction, indicated by the presence of Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus in deep waters. Our findings suggest that dipoles, with their unique characteristics, might act as a driver for microbial community dynamics. IMPORTANCE Oceanic dipoles, which consist of a cyclonic eddy and an anticyclonic eddy together, are among the most contrasted phenomena in the ocean. Dipoles generate strong vertical mixing and horizontal advection, inducing biological responses. This study provides vertical profiles of microbial abundance, diversity, and community structure in a mesoscale dipole.

The integrated agricultural practice (IP) developed in northeast China, by altering row spacing of planting, adopting no-tillage and returning all crop residues, showed great benefit in sustaining crop yield. However, its effect on the soil microbiome remains largely elusive. This study evaluated the effect of 12-year integrated agricultural practice on the structure and activity of the soil microbial community at different soil depths in Chinas Mollisols zone. The experiment consisted of integrated agricultural practice and conventional practice (CP) treatments in a split-plot arrangement. The soil microbial community was characterized by MiSeq sequencing. The results showed that agricultural practices affected 12 phyla, 24 classes, 32 orders and 75 families in the bacterial community and one phyla, four classes, 12 orders and 18 families in the fungal community. Integrated agricultural practice resulted in greater bacterial richness and diversity, and increased the relative abundances of Actinobacteria, Gemmatimonadetes, Verrucomicrobia and Ascomycota, but reduced Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Basidiomycota in the dominant bacterial and fungal phyla. These findings suggested that integrated agricultural practice modified the soil physiochemical properties and consequently altered microbial community structure and diversity, which in turn affected soil microbial biomass and enzyme activities. These changes under integrated agricultural practice could have contributed to the enhanced crop yield, suggesting that IP is a sustainable agricultural practice.",2018,69,10.1111/ejss.12679

Recently, however, new findings have evoked the role of previously neglected processes, such as dispersal limitation, determining the distribution of a wide range of microorganisms, including cyanobacteria. Here, we reviewed the biogeographic patterns of cyanobacteria with focus on molecular data and the evidences from the published literature for the processes driving these patterns. Also, considerations are made about concept of species, discordances in the taxonomic concepts, and level of taxonomic resolution, and how these affect the biogeographic study of cyanobacteria. From a overview, it can be observed that both environmental and historical factors are important to structure cyanobacteria diversity across time and space. Moreover, different species may exhibit significant differences in their distribution patterns, from possibly cosmopolitan species to other endemic species. However, distribution patterns are closely dependent on the concept of species, besides the taxonomic resolution, spatial and environmental scales, and the biases of the molecular methodologies applied in the studies. Thus, efforts to broaden sampling and sequencing of unknown and less-known species, as well as geographic regions and habitats poorly exploited, are crucial for a better understanding of cyanobacteria biogeography.",2018,820,10.1007/s10750-018-3669-x
"Choudoir, MJ; Buckley, DH",Phylogenetic conservatism of thermal traits explains dispersal limitation and genomic differentiation of Streptomyces sister-taxa,ISME JOURNAL,"The latitudinal diversity gradient is a pattern of biogeography observed broadly in plants and animals but largely undocumented in terrestrial microbial systems. Although patterns of microbial biogeography across broad taxonomic scales have been described in a range of contexts, the mechanisms that generate biogeographic patterns between closely related taxa remain incompletely characterized. Adaptive processes are a major driver of microbial biogeography, but there is less understanding of how microbial biogeography and diversification are shaped by dispersal limitation and drift. We recently described a latitudinal diversity gradient of species richness and intraspecific genetic diversity in Streptomyces by using a geographically explicit culture collection. Within this geographically explicit culture collection, we have identified Streptomyces sister-taxa whose geographic distribution is delimited by latitude. These sister-taxa differ in geographic distribution, genomic diversity, and ecological traits despite having nearly identical SSU rRNA gene sequences. Comparative genomic analysis reveals genomic differentiation of these sister-taxa consistent with restricted gene flow across latitude. Furthermore, we show phylogenetic conservatism of thermal traits between the sister-taxa suggesting that thermal trait adaptation limits dispersal and gene flow across climate regimes as defined by latitude. Such phylogenetic conservatism of thermal traits is commonly associated with latitudinal diversity gradients for plants and animals. These data provide further support for the hypothesis that the Streptomyces latitudinal diversity gradient was formed as a result of historical demographic processes defined by dispersal limitation and driven by paleoclimate dynamics.",2018,12,10.1038/s41396-018-0180-3

Since the early twentieth century, it has been known that B vitamins play an important role in phytoplankton community dynamics. Limited oceanic dissolved B vitamin distributions indicate that these important coenzymes are present at picomolar levels, which could be too low to support maximal phytoplankton growth, and vast regions of the ocean exist where they are undetectable. Despite their importance, particulate B vitamin concentrations of field microbial populations are unknown. Here we report B vitamin concentrations measured in both the particulate and dissolved fractions, including multiple biochemically relevant B vitamin congeners. We establish their spatial distributions spanning distinct biogeographic and oceanographic regimes in the Mediterranean Sea and the Eastern Atlantic Ocean and show that all congeners are present both dissolved in seawater and in suspended particles. We observe that B vitamins cooccur in patches defined by regional biogeographic and oceanographic features. Additionally, distinct patterns of congener relative abundance in the dissolved and particulate pools provide insight to biological and chemical cycling of these compounds between and within the dissolved and particulate pools. Finally, linear model results demonstrate that model fits of microbial assemblages are strongest when they include both inorganic nutrients and dissolved B vitamin concentrations.

Since the turn of the 20th century, MSR water quality has continually rated poorly due to human activity. Acting as first responders, microorganisms can mitigate, exacerbate, and/or serve as predictors for water quality, yet we know little about their community structure or ecology at the whole river scale for large rivers. We collected both biological (16S and 18S rRNA gene amplicons) and physicochemical data from 38 MSR sites over nearly 3000 km from Minnesota to the Gulf of Mexico. Our results revealed a microbial community composed of similar taxa to other rivers but with unique trends in the relative abundance patterns among phyla, operational taxonomic units (OTUs), and the core microbiome. Furthermore, we observed a separation in microbial communities that mirrored the transition from an 8th to 10th Strahler order river at the Missouri River confluence, marking a different start to the lower MSR than the historical distinction at the Ohio River confluence in Cairo, IL. Within MSR microbial assemblages, we identified subgroups of OTUs from the phyla Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Oomycetes, and Heterokonts that were associated with, and predictive of, the important eutrophication nutrients nitrate and phosphate. This study offers the most comprehensive view of MSR microbiota to date, provides important groundwork for higher resolution microbial studies of river perturbation, and identifies potential microbial indicators of river health related to eutrophication.",2018,63,10.1002/lno.10811
"Gaulke, CA; Arnold, HK; Humphreys, IR; Kembel, SW; ODwyer, JP; Sharpton, TJ",Ecophylogenetics Clarifies the Evolutionary Association between Mammals and Their Gut Microbiota,MBIO,"Our knowledge of how the gut microbiome relates to mammalian evolution benefits from the identification of gut microbial taxa that are unexpectedly prevalent or unexpectedly conserved across mammals. Such taxa enable experimental determination of the traits needed for such microbes to succeed as gut generalists, as well as those traits that impact mammalian fitness. However, the punctuated resolution of microbial taxonomy may limit our ability to detect conserved gut microbes, especially in cases in which broadly related microbial lineages possess shared traits that drive their apparent ubiquity across mammals. To advance the discovery of conserved mammalian gut microbes, we developed a novel ecophylogenetic approach to taxonomy that groups microbes into taxonomic units based on their shared ancestry and their common distribution across mammals. Applying this approach to previously generated gut microbiome data uncovered monophyletic clades of gut bacteria that are conserved across mammals. It also resolved microbial clades exclusive to and conserved among particular mammalian lineages. Conserved clades often manifest phylogenetic patterns, such as cophylogeny with their host, that indicate that they are subject to selective processes, such as host filtering. Moreover, this analysis identified variation in the rate at which mammals acquire or lose conserved microbial clades and resolved a human-accelerated loss of conserved clades. Collectively, the data from this study reveal mammalian gut microbiota that possess traits linked to mammalian phylogeny, point to the existence of a core set of microbes that comprise the mammalian gut microbiome, and clarify potential evolutionary or ecologic mechanisms driving the gut microbiomes diversification throughout mammalian evolution. IMPORTANCE Our understanding of mammalian evolution has become microbiome-aware. While emerging research links mammalian biodiversity and the gut microbiome, we lack insight into which microbes potentially impact mammalian evolution. Microbes common to diverse mammalian species may be strong candidates, as their absence in the gut may affect how the microbiome functionally contributes to mammalian physiology to adversely affect fitness. Identifying such conserved gut microbes is thus important to ultimately assessing the microbiomes potential role in mammalian evolution. To advance their discovery, we developed an approach that identifies ancestrally related groups of microbes that distribute across mammals in a way that indicates their collective conservation. These conserved clades are presumed to have evolved a trait in their ancestor that matters to their distribution across mammals and which has been retained among clade members. We found not only that such clades do exist among mammals but also that they appear to be subject to natural selection and characterize human evolution.",2018,9,10.1128/mBio.01348-18

A major barrier to mechanistic studies is the lack of tools for the efficient genetic manipulation of wild and diverse bacterial isolates. To address the need for improved molecular tools, we used a collection of proteobacterial isolates native to the zebrafish intestinal microbiota as a testbed to construct a series of modernized vectors that expedite genetic knock-in and knockout procedures across lineages. The innovations that we introduce enhance the flexibility of conventional genetic techniques, making it easier to manipulate many different bacterial isolates with a single set of tools. We developed alternative strategies for domestication-free conjugation, designed plasmids with customizable features, and streamlined allelic exchange using visual markers of homologous recombination. We demonstrate the potential of these tools through a comparative study of bacterial behavior within the zebrafish intestine. Live imaging of fluorescently tagged isolates revealed a spectrum of distinct population structures that differ in their biogeography and dominant growth mode (i.e., planktonic versus aggregated). Most striking, we observed divergent genotype-phenotype relationships: several isolates that are predicted by genomic analysis and in vitro assays to be capable of flagellar motility do not display this trait within living hosts. Together, the tools generated in this work provide a new resource for the functional characterization of wild and diverse bacterial lineages that will help speed the research pipeline from sequencing-based correlations to mechanistic underpinnings. IMPORTANCE A great challenge in microbiota research is the immense diversity of symbiotic bacteria with the capacity to impact the lives of plants and animals. Moving beyond correlative DNA sequencing-based studies to define the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which symbiotic bacteria influence the biology of their hosts is stalling because genetic manipulation of new and uncharacterized bacterial isolates remains slow and difficult with current genetic tools. Moreover, developing tools de novo is an arduous and time-consuming task and thus represents a significant barrier to progress. To address this problem, we developed a suite of engineering vectors that streamline conventional genetic techniques by improving postconjugation counterselection, modularity, and allelic exchange. Our modernized tools and step-by-step protocols will empower researchers to investigate the inner workings of both established and newly emerging models of bacterial symbiosis.",2018,9,10.1128/mBio.01877-18
"Rohwer, RR; Hamilton, JJ; Newton, RJ; McMahon, KD",TaxAss: Leveraging a Custom Freshwater Database Achieves Fine-Scale Taxonomic Resolution,MSPHERE,"Taxonomy assignment of freshwater microbial communities is limited by the minimally curated phylogenies used for large taxonomy databases. Here we introduce TaxAss, a taxonomy assignment workflow that classifies 16S rRNA gene amplicon data using two taxonomy reference databases: a large comprehensive database and a small ecosystem-specific database rigorously curated by scientists within a field. We applied TaxAss to five different freshwater data sets using the comprehensive SILVA database and the freshwater-specific FreshTrain database. TaxAss increased the percentage of the data set classified compared to using only SILVA, especially at fine-resolution family to species taxon levels, while across the freshwater test data sets classifications increased by as much as 11 to 40% of total reads. A similar increase in classifications was not observed in a control mouse gut data set, which was not expected to contain freshwater bacteria. TaxAss also maintained taxonomic richness compared to using only the FreshTrain across all taxon levels from phylum to species. Without TaxAss, most organisms not represented in the FreshTrain were unclassified, but at fine taxon levels, incorrect classifications became significant. We validated TaxAss using simulated amplicon data derived from full-length clone libraries and found that 96 to 99% of test sequences were correctly classified at fine resolution. TaxAss splits a data sets sequences into two groups based on their percent identity to reference sequences in the ecosystem-specific database. Sequences with high similarity to sequences in the ecosystem-specific database are classified using that database, and the others are classified using the comprehensive database. TaxAss is free and open source and is available at https://www.github.com/McMahonLab/TaxAss. IMPORTANCE Microbial communities drive ecosystem processes, but microbial community composition analyses using 16S rRNA gene amplicon data sets are limited by the lack of fine-resolution taxonomy classifications. Coarse taxonomic groupings at the phylum, class, and order levels lump ecologically distinct organisms together. To avoid this, many researchers define operational taxonomic units (OTUs) based on clustered sequences, sequence variants, or unique sequences. These fine-resolution groupings are more ecologically relevant, but OTU definitions are data set dependent and cannot be compared between data sets. Microbial ecologists studying freshwater have curated a small, ecosystem-specific taxonomy database to provide consistent and up-to-date terminology. We created TaxAss, a workflow that leverages this database to assign taxonomy. We found that TaxAss improves fine-resolution taxonomic classifications (family, genus, and species). Fine taxonomic groupings are more ecologically relevant, so they provide an alternative to OTU-based analyses that is consistent and comparable between data sets.",2018,3,10.1128/mSphere.00327-18

Bifidobacterium species are less prone to possessing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes (ARGs) than other taxa that may colonize infants. Given that AMR is a growing public health crisis and ARGs are present in the gut microbiome of humans from early life, this study examines the correlation between a Bifidobacterium-dominated infant gut microbiome and AMR levels, measured by a culture-independent metagenomic approach both in early life and as infants become toddlers. In general, Bifidobacterium dominance is associated with a significant reduction in AMR in a Bangladeshi cohort, both in the number of acquired AMR genes present and in the abundance of AMR genes. However, by year 2, Bangladeshi infants had no significant differences in AMR related to their early-life Bifidobacterium levels. A generalized linear model including all infants in a previously published Swedish cohort found a significant negative association between log-transformed total AMR and Bifidobacterium levels, thus confirming the relationship between Bifidobacterium levels and AMR. In both cohorts, there was no change between early-life and later-life AMR abundance in high-Bifidobacterium infants but a significant reduction in AMR abundance in low-Bifidobacterium infants. These results support the hypothesis that early Bifidobacterium dominance of the infant gut microbiome may help reduce colonization by taxa containing ARGs. IMPORTANCE Infants are vulnerable to an array of infectious diseases, and as the gut microbiome may serve as a reservoir of AMR for pathogens, reducing the levels of AMR in infants is important to infant health. This study demonstrates that high levels of Bifidobacterium are associated with reduced levels of AMR in early life and suggests that probiotic interventions to increase infant Bifidobacterium levels have the potential to reduce AMR in infants. However, this effect is not sustained at year 2 of age in Bangladeshi infants, underscoring the need for more detailed studies of the biogeography and timing of infant AMR acquisition.",2018,3,10.1128/mSphere.00441-18

Leveraging associations of current geographic distributions of bacteria with historic climate, we predict that soil bacterial diversity will increase across the majority (similar to 75%) of the Tibetan Plateau and northern North America if bacterial communities equilibrate with existing climatic conditions. This prediction is possible because the current distributions of soil bacteria have stronger correlations with climate from similar to 50 years ago than with current climate. This lag is likely associated with the time it takes for soil properties to adjust to changes in climate. The predicted changes are location specific and differ across bacterial taxa, including some bacteria that are predicted to have reductions in their distributions. These findings illuminate the widespread potential of climate change to influence belowground diversity and the importance of considering bacterial communities when assessing climate impacts on terrestrial ecosystems. IMPORTANCE There have been many studies highlighting how plant and animal communities lag behind climate change, causing extinction and diversity debts that will slowly be paid as communities equilibrate. By virtue of their short generation times and dispersal abilities, soil bacteria might be expected to respond to climate change quickly and to be effectively in equilibrium with current climatic conditions. We found strong evidence to the contrary in Tibet and North America. These findings could significantly improve understanding of climate impacts on soil microbial communities.",2018,3,10.1128/mSystems.00167-18

One reason for this challenge is that relationships between characteristics of microbiomes and the system-level processes that they influence are often evaluated in the absence of a robust conceptual framework and reported without elucidating the underlying causal mechanisms. The reliance on correlative approaches limits the potential to expand the inference of a single relationship to additional systems and advance the field. We propose that research focused on how microbiomes influence the systems they inhabit should work within a common framework and target known microbial processes that contribute to the system-level processes of interest. Here, we identify three distinct categories of microbiome characteristics (microbial processes, microbial community properties and microbial membership) and propose a framework to empirically link each of these categories to each other and the broader system-level processes that they affect. We posit that it is particularly important to distinguish microbial community properties that can be predicted using constituent taxa (community-aggregated traits) from those properties that cannot currently be predicted using constituent taxa (emergent properties). Existing methods in microbial ecology can be applied to more explicitly elucidate properties within each of these three categories of microbial characteristics and connect them with each other. We view this proposed framework, gleaned from a breadth of research on environmental microbiomes and ecosystem processes, as a promising pathway with the potential to advance discovery and understanding across a broad range of microbiome science.",2018,3,10.1038/s41564-018-0201-z
"Shiau, YJ; Cai, YF; Jia, ZJ; Chen, CL; Chiu, CY",Phylogenetically distinct methanotrophs modulate methane oxidation in rice paddies across Taiwan,SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY,"Rice paddies are considerable sources of methane because of the highly reduced soil oxidation-reduction conditions during rice cultivation. In this ecosystem, active methane-oxidizing bacteria are important, because they consume methane while reducing the overall emissions from rice paddy soils. However, the biogeographic distribution of active methanotrophs in paddy soils across Taiwan remains poorly understood. We used DNA based stable isotope probing (DNA-SIP) to show that phylogenetically distinct type I and type II methanotrophs dominated methane oxidation in geographically different paddy soils across Taiwan. High-throughput sequencing of soil 16S rRNA and pmoA genes under field conditions revealed that a type II methanotroph, Methylocystis, was predominant in rice paddy soils. In addition, an uncultured novel type I methanotroph cluster (Rice Paddy Clusters) was detected with the closest relatedness to Methylocaldum 16S rRNA genes in all rice field soils tested. SIP microcosm incubation, however, suggested that the type I methanotrophs Methylosarcina and Methylobacter were significantly stimulated during the consumption of high-concentration methane in five paddy soils with pH > 6.07, whereas the Methylosinus-like microorganisms of type II methanotrophs dominated aerobic methane-oxidizing communities in acidic soil with pH = 5.17. Furthermore, high-throughput sequencing of C-13-pmoA genes indicated the presence of novel methanotrophs that are phylogenetically distantly related to the type I methanotrophs Methylosarcina in four out of five non-acidic paddy soils studied, and the high proportions in the C-13-DNA suggested that these uncultured methanotrophs play an important role in methane oxidation. These results provide strong evidence for the environmental selection of phylogenetically distinct methanotrophs under field conditions. Moreover, community shifts in active methanotrophs likely occurred in response to environmental variations with fluctuating methane concentrations.",2018,124,10.1016/j.soilbio.2018.05.025

Recent studies have demonstrated that these rare taxa serve as limitless reservoirs of genetic diversity, and perform disproportionate types of functions despite their low abundances. However, relatively little is known about the mechanisms controlling rarity and the processes promoting the development of the rare biosphere. Here, we propose the use of multivariate cut-offs to estimate rare species and phylogenetic null models applied to predefined rare taxa to disentangle the relative influences of ecoevolutionary processes mediating the assembly of the rare biosphere. Importantly, the identification of the factors controlling rare species assemblages is critical for understanding the types of rarity, how the rare biosphere is established, and how rare microorganisms fluctuate over spatiotemporal scales, thus enabling prospective predictions of ecosystem responses.",2018,26,10.1016/j.tim.2018.02.011

These viruses are ubiquitous in the sea and have impact on marine microbial community structure and dynamics through their lytic infection cycle. However, their diversity and biogeography have been poorly characterized due to the scarce detection of Megaviridae sequences in metagenomes, as well as the limitation of reference sequences used to design specific primers for this viral group. Here, we propose a set of 82 degenerated primers (referred to as MEGAPRIMER), targeting DNA polymerase genes (polBs) of Megaviridae. MEGAPRIMER was designed based on 921 Megaviridae polBs from sequenced genomes and metagenomes. By applying this primer set to environmental DNA meta-barcoding of a coastal seawater sample, we report 5595 non-singleton operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of Megaviridae at 97% nucleotide sequence identity. The majority of the OTUs were found to form diverse clades, which were phylogenetically distantly related to known viruses such as Mimivirus. The Megaviridae OTUs detected in this study outnumber the giant virus OTUs identified in previous individual studies by more than an order of magnitude.

This ecosystem is known to be shaped by many factors, including climate, geography, host nutrition, lifestyle and medication. Thus, knowledge of varying populations with different habits is important for a better understanding of the microbiome. Design We therefore conducted a metagenomic analysis of intestinal microbiota from Kazakh donors, recruiting 84 subjects, including male and female healthy subjects and metabolic syndrome (MetS) patients aged 25-75 years, from the Kazakh administrative centre, Astana. We characterise and describe these microbiomes, the first deep-sequencing cohort from Central Asia, in comparison with a global dataset (832 individuals from five countries on three continents), and explore correlations between microbiota, clinical and laboratory parameters as well as with nutritional data from Food Frequency Questionnaires. Results We observe that Kazakh microbiomes are relatively different from both European and East Asian counterparts, though similar to other Central Asian microbiomes, with the most striking difference being significantly more samples falling within the Prevotella-rich enterotype, potentially reflecting regional diet and lifestyle. We show that this enterotype designation remains stable within an individual over time in 82% of cases. We further observe gut microbiome features that distinguish MetS patients from controls (eg, significantly reduced Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio, Bifidobacteria and Subdoligranulum, alongside increased Prevotella), though these overlap little with previously published reports and thus may reflect idiosyncrasies of the present cohort. Conclusion Taken together, this exploratory study describes gut microbiome data from an understudied population, providing a starting point for further comparative work on biogeography and research on widespread diseases.",2018,8,10.1136/bmjopen-2018-021682

The diversity of novel groups of myxobacteria in these environments appears unprecedented, especially in the Sorangiineae and Nannocystineae suborders. The Sandaracinaceae related clade in the Sorangiineae suborder seems more widely distributed compared to the exclusively marine myxobacterial cluster.

Plant infection assays revealed variable nodulation and symbiotic effectiveness among the 43 bacterial isolates tested. Strains from Ruace generally promoted greater whole-plant growth than the others. 16S rRNA-RFLP analysis of genomic DNA extracted from the rhizobial isolates produced different banding patterns, a clear indication of high bacterial diversity. However, the multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) data showed alignment of the isolates with B. elkanii species. The 16S rRNA sequences of representative soybean isolates selected from each 16S rRNA-RFLP cluster showed their relatedness to B. elkanii, as well as to other Bradyrhizobium species. But a concatenated phylogeny of two housekeeping genes (glnII and gyrB) identified the soybean nodulating isolates as Bradyrhizobium, with very close relatedness to B. elkanii. The nifH and nodC sequences also showed that the majority of the test soybean isolates were closely related to B. elkanii, albeit the inconsistency with some isolates. Taken together, these findings suggest that the B. elkanii group are the preferred dominant microsymbiont of soybean grown in Mozambican soils. Furthermore, the distribution of soybean rhizobia in the agricultural soils of Mozambique was found to be markedly influenced by soil pH, followed by the concentrations of plant-available P and Mn. This study suggested that the identified isolates TUTMJM5, TUTMIITA5A and TUTLBC2B can be used as inoculants for increased soybean production in Mozambique. (C) 2018 The Author(s).

Here, we used high-throughput sequencing to examine the relative contribution of selective and neutral processes in the assembly of abundant and rare subcommunities from three subtropical bays of China. We found that abundant and rare bacterial taxa were distinctly different in diversity, despite the similar biogeographic patterns and strong distance-decay relationships, but the dispersal of rare bacterial taxa was more limited than that of abundant taxa. Furthermore, the environmental (selective processes) and spatial (neutral processes) factors seemed to govern the assembly and biogeography of abundant and rare bacterial subcommunities, although both factors explained only a small fraction of variation within the rare subcommunity. More importantly, variation partitioning (based on adjusted R-2 in redundancy analysis) showed that spatial factors exhibited a slightly greater influence on both abundant and rare subcommunities compared to environmental selection; however, the abundant subcommunity had a much stronger response to spatial factors (17.3% of pure variance was explained) than that shown by the rare bacteria (3.5%). These results demonstrate that environmental selection and neutral processes explained the similar biogeographic patterns of abundant and rare subcommunities, but a large proportion of unexplained variation in the rare taxa (91.1%) implies that more complex assembly mechanisms may exist to shape the rare bacterial assemblages in the three subtropical bays.",2018,12,10.1038/s41396-018-0153-6

That island characteristics, including remoteness, can profoundly modulate biological diversity has been borne out by studies of animals and plants. By contrast, the processes influencing microbial diversity in island systems remain largely undetermined. We sequenced arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal DNA from plant roots collected on 13 islands worldwide and compared AM fungal diversity on islands with existing data from mainland sites. AM fungal communities on islands (even those >6000 km from the closest mainland) comprised few endemic taxa and were as diverse as mainland communities. Thus, in contrast to patterns recorded among macro-organisms, efficient dispersal appears to outweigh the effects of taxogenesis and extinction in regulating AM fungal diversity on islands. Nonetheless, AM fungal communities on more distant islands comprised a higher proportion of previously cultured and large-spored taxa, indicating that dispersal may be human-mediated or require tolerance of significant environmental stress, such as exposure to sunlight or high salinity. The processes driving large-scale patterns of microbial diversity are a key consideration for attempts to conserve and restore functioning ecosystems in this era of rapid global change.",2018,12,10.1038/s41396-018-0196-8

Furthermore, few of these studies have taken place in tropical ecosystems that experience an inordinate rate of invasions into native habitats. Here, we examined the effects of plant invasions dominated by non-native tree species on the diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi in Hawaii. To test the hypothesis that invasions result in consistent changes in AM fungal diversity across spatial gradients relative to native forest habitats, we sampled soil in paired native and invaded sites from three watersheds and used amplicon sequencing to characterize AM fungal communities. Whether our analyses considered phylogenetic relatedness or not, we found that invasions consistently increased the richness of AM fungi. However, AM fungal species composition was not related to invasion status of the vegetation nor local environment, but stratified by watershed. Our results suggest that while invasions can lead to an overall increase in the diversity of microbial mutualists, the effects of plant host identity or geographic structuring potentially outweigh those of invasive species in determining the community membership of AM fungi. Thus, host specificity and spatial factors such as dispersal need to be taken into consideration when examining the effects of biological invasions on symbiotic microbes.",2018,20,10.1007/s10530-018-1710-7

This study examined co-diversification between the notorious agricultural pest Diaphorina citri and its primary endosymbionts (P-endosymbiont), Candidatus Carsonella ruddii at the population level. RESULTSMaximum likelihood, haplotype network, principal components and Bayesian clustering identified three lineages for D. citri and its P-endosymbiont: a Western clade containing individuals from Pakistan, Bhutan (Phuentsholing), Vietnam (Son La), USA, Myanmar and China (Ruili, Yunnan); a Central clade, with accessions originating from Southwest China, Bhutan (Tsirang) and Bangladesh; and an Eastern clade containing individuals from Southeast Asia, and East and South China. A more diverse genetic structure was apparent in the host mitochondrial DNA than their P-endosymbionts; however, the two sets of data were strongly congruent. CONCLUSIONThis study provides evidence for the co-diversification of D. citri and its P-endosymbiont during the migration from South Asia to East and Southeast Asia. We also suggest that the P-endosymbiont may facilitate investigations into the genealogy and migration history of the host. The biogeography of D. citri and its P-endosymbiont indicated that D. citri colonized and underwent a secondary dispersal from South Asia to East and Southeast Asia.

No study to date has evaluated phylogenetic relationships within this family and the historical pattern of diversification within the group remains unknown. Moreover, species limits, particularly in widespread taxa that show geographic variation, remain unclear. In this study, we delimited species and estimated phylogenetic relationships using multilocus data for the entire family. We then used the inferred diversity along with alternative taxonomic classification schemes to evaluate how lumping and splitting of both taxa and geographical areas influenced biogeographic inference. Species-tree analyses grouped Polioptilidae into four main clades: Microbates, Ramphocaenus, a Polioptila guianensis complex, and the remaining members of Polioptila. Ramphocaenus melanurus was sister to the clade containing M. cinereiventris and M. collaris, which formed a clade sister to all species within Polioptila. Polioptila was composed of two clades, the first of which included the P. guianensis complex; the other contained all remaining species in the genus. Using multispecies coalescent modeling, we inferred a more than 3-fold increase in species diversity, of which 87% represent currently recognized species or subspecies. Much of this diversity corresponded to subspecies that occur in the Neotropics. We identified three polyphyletic species, and delimited 4-6 previously undescribed candidate taxa. Probabilistic modeling of geographic ranges on the species tree indicated that the family likely had an ancestral origin in South America, with all three genera independently colonizing North America. Support for this hypothesis, however, was sensitive to the taxonomic classification scheme used and the number of geographical areas allowed. Our study proposes the first phylogenetic hypothesis for Polioptilidae and provides genealogical support for the reclassification of species limits.

The coastal northern Zhejiang (in the East China Sea) is a typical subtropical marine ecosystemwithmultiple environmental gradients that has been extensively perturbed by anthropogenic activities. Thus, it is a valuable region to investigate the key drivers that shape microbial biogeography. We investigated microeukaryotic communities in surface waters from115 stations in this region using 18S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing. The microeukaryotic communities were mainly comprised of Dinoflagellata, Ciliophora, Protalveolata, Rhizaria, Stramenopiles and Cryptophyceae. The top abundant operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were highly specific for distinct habitat types, exhibiting significant environment-conditioned features; however, the cosmopolitan OTUs were not strongly correlated with the measured environmental variables. Total phosphorus and suspended particles were major environmental determinants of microeukaryotic alpha-diversity. Environmental variables, particularly temperature, salinity, pH and silicate concentration, were strongly associated with the microeukaryotic community composition. Overall, environmental and spatial factors explained 55.92% of community variation in total with 34.03% of the variation shared, suggesting that spatially structured environmental variations mainly conditioned the microeukaryotic biogeography in this region. Additionally, dispersal limitation, as indicated by the great pure spatial effect and distance-decay pattern, was another important factor. In summary, our results reveal that spatially structured environmental variation and dispersal limitation mainly conditioned the microeukaryotic biogeography.

However, little is known of their vertical responses to restoration process and their contributions to soil nutrient cycling in the subsurface profiles. Here, we investigated the community assembly of soil bacteria, archaea, and fungi along vertical (i.e., soil depths of 0-300 cm) and horizontal (i.e., distance from trees of 30-90 cm) profiles in a chronosequence of reforestation sites that represent over 30 years of restoration. Results: In the superficial layers (0-80 cm), bacterial and fungal diversity decreased, whereas archaeal diversity increased with increasing soil depth. As reforestation proceeded over time, the vertical spatial variation in bacterial communities decreased, while that in archaeal and fungal communities increased. Vertical distributions of the soil microbiomes were more related to the variation in soil properties, while their horizontal distributions may be driven by a gradient effect of roots extending from the tree. Bacterial and archaeal beta-diversity were strongly related to multi-nutrient cycling in the soil, respectively, playing major roles in deep and superficial layers. Conclusions: Taken together, these results reveal a new perspective on the vertical and horizontal spatial variation in soil microbiomes at the fine scale of single trees.

Genetic distances showed low differentiation among the proposed Dromiciops species, consistent with typical levels of intraspecific variation. Phylogenetic analyses yielded only moderate support for monophyly of D. bozinovici, while depicting polyphyly in D. gliroides and D. mondaca. Species delimitation analyses did not recover the proposed 3-species scenario, and the taxonomic index of congruence among these methods (C-tax = 0.5-1.0) supported monotypic status for Dromiciops.

Here we show, by leveraging metagenomics and metabarcoding of global topsoil samples (189 sites, 7,560 subsamples), that bacterial, but not fungal, genetic diversity is highest in temperate habitats and that microbial gene composition varies more strongly with environmental variables than with geographic distance. We demonstrate that fungi and bacteria show global niche differentiation that is associated with contrasting diversity responses to precipitation and soil pH. Furthermore, we provide evidence for strong bacterial-fungal antagonism, inferred from antibiotic-resistance genes, in topsoil and ocean habitats, indicating the substantial role of biotic interactions in shaping microbial communities.

"Ma, ZS; Li, LW; Li, W",Assessing and Interpreting the Within-Body Biogeography of Human Microbiome Diversity,FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY,"A human body hosts a relatively independent microbiome including five major regional biomes (i.e., airway, oral, gut, skin, and urogenital). Each of them may possess different regional characteristics with important implications to our health and diseases (i.e., so-termed microbiome associated diseases). Nevertheless, these regional microbiomes are connected with each other through diffusions and migrations. Here, we investigate the within-body (intra-individual) distribution feature of microbiome diversity via diversity area relationship (DAR) modeling, which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been systematically studied previously. We utilized the Hill numbers for measuring alpha and beta-diversities and built 1,200 within-body DAR models with to date the most comprehensive human microbiome datasets of 18 sites from the human microbiome project (HMP) cohort. We established the intra-DAR profile (z-q pattern: the diversity scaling parameter z of the power law (PL) at diversity order q = 0-3), intra-PDO (pair-wise diversity overlap) profile (g-q), and intra-MAD (maximal accrual diversity) profile (D-max-q) for the within-body biogeography of the human microbiome. These profiles constitute the maps of the within-body biogeography, and offer important insights on the within-body distribution of the human microbiome. Furthermore, we investigated the heterogeneity among individuals in their biogeography parameters and found that there is not an average Joe that can represent majority of individuals in a cohort or population. For example, we found that most individuals in the HMP cohort have relatively lower maximal accrual diversity (MAD) or in the long tail of the so-termed power law distribution. In the meantime, there are a small number of individuals in the cohort who possess disproportionally higher MAD values. These findings may have important implications for personalized medicine of the human microbiome.",2018,9,10.3389/fmicb.2018.01619
"Lyu, TS; Liu, GS; Zhang, HX; Wang, LD; Zhou, SY; Dou, HS; Pang, B; Sha, WL; Zhang, HH",Changes in feeding habits promoted the differentiation of the composition and function of gut microbiotas between domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) and gray wolves (Canis lupus),AMB EXPRESS,"Wolves (Canis lupus) and their domesticated and close relatives, dogs (Canis lupus familiaris), have great differences in their diets and living environments. To the best of our knowledge, the fundamental question of how the abundance and function of the gut microbiota of domestic dogs evolved to adapt to the changes in host feeding habits has yet to be addressed. In this study, our comparative analyses of gut metagenomes showed that the abundance of gut microbiota between the two species have some significant differences. Furthermore, a number of taxa observed in higher numbers in domestic dogs are related to carbohydrate metabolism, which may be because that there were more complicated polysaccharides in dogs diets than that in wolves diets. A significant difference in the abundance of genes encoding glycosyltransferase family 34 (GT34), carbohydrate-binding module family 25 (CBM25), and glycoside hydrolase family 13 (GH13) between the gut microbiota metagenomes of domestic dogs and gray wolves also supported this observation. Furthermore, the domestic dog gut microbiota has greater valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis and nitrogen metabolism. This result showed that compared with wolves, the domestic dog diet contains a smaller amount of animal protein, which is consistent with the dietary composition of wolves and dogs. Our results indicate that the function and abundance of gut microbiota of domestic dogs has been adapted to domestication, which is of great significance for the ability of domestic dogs to adapt to changes in food composition.",2018,8,10.1186/s13568-018-0652-x

This is especially true for environmentally transmitted bacteria that cycle between their hosts and the surrounding habitat. As geologic history, biogeography, and other factors such as water temperature, salinity, and physical barriers can inhibit bacterial movement to novel environments, we chose to examine the genetic architecture of Euprymna albatrossae (Mollusca: Cephalopoda) and their Vibrio fischeri symbionts in the Philippine archipelago using a combined phylogeographic approach. Eleven separate sites in thePhilippine islands were examined using haplotype estimates that were examined via nested clade analysis to determine the relationship between E.albatrossae and V.fischeri populations and their geographic location. Identical analyses of molecular variance (AMOVA) were used to estimate variation within and between populations for host and symbiont genetic data. Host animals demonstrated a significant amount of variation within island groups, while symbiont variation was found within individual populations. Nested clade phylogenetic analysis revealed that hosts and symbionts may have colonized this area at different times, with a sudden change in habitat. Additionally, host data indicate restricted gene flow, whereas symbionts show range expansion, followed by periodic restriction to genetic flow. These differences between host and symbiont networks indicate that factors outside the squid influence distribution of Philippine V.fischeri. Our results shed light on how geography and changing environmental factors can impact marine symbiotic associations at both local and global scales.",2018,8,10.1002/ece3.4266

Here we analyzed the patterns of ARGs from 42 natural waterbodies (natural lakes and reservoirs) across China using high-throughput approaches. The major ARGs were multidrug genes and the main resistance mechanism was the efflux pump. Although the absolute abundance of ARGs (gene copies/L) in the south/central waterbodies was similar to the northern waterbodies, the normalized abundance of ARGs (ARGs/16S rRNA gene copy number) was higher in the south/central waterbodies than in the north (mainly because of the aminoglycoside and multidrug resistance genes). Human activities strongly correlated with the normalized abundance of ARGs. The composition of ARGs in the waterbodies of south/central China was different from that in the north, and ARGs showed a distance-decay relationship. Anthropogenic factors had the most significant effects on this spatial distribution of ARG composition, followed by the spatial, bacterial and physicochemical factors. These indicate that the ARGs exhibited biogeographical patterns and that multiple ecological mechanisms - such as environmental selection (human activities and local physicochemical parameters) and dispersal limitation - influence distribution of ARGs in these waters. In general, our results provide a valuable ecological insight to explain the large-scale dispersal patterns in ARGs, thereby having potential applications for both public health and environmental management.",2018,117,10.1016/j.envint.2018.05.023

In this study, biofilms developed in marine and freshwater locations were exposed to prolonged darkness and aging by mimicking ballast water conditions in the laboratory. Upon prolonged darkness, the decay of phytoplankton, as indicated by the decrease in chlorophyll a in marine biofilms, led to remineralization and enhanced bacterial and protist populations. However, the same trend was not observed in the case of freshwater biofilms wherein the microbial parameters (i.e., bacteria, protists) and chlorophyll a decreased drastically. The bacterial community structure in such conditions was evaluated by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR), and results showed that the biofilm bacterial communities changed significantly over a period of time. alpha-Proteobacteria was the most stable taxonomic group in the marine biofilms under dark conditions. However, beta-proteobacteria dominated the freshwater biofilms and seemed to play an important role in organic matter remineralization. gamma-Proteobacteria, which includes most of the pathogenic genera, were affected significantly and decreased in both the types of biofilms. This study revealed that marine biofilm communities were able to adapt better to the dark conditions while freshwater biofilm communities collapsed. Adaptation of tolerant bacterial communities, regeneration of nutrients via cell lysis, and presence of grazers appeared to be key factors for survival upon prolonged darkness. However, the fate of biofilm communities upon discharge in the new environment and their invasion potential is an important topic for future investigation.",2018,76,10.1007/s00248-018-1149-5

However, little is known about the impact of cross fostering on the intestinal microbiota and mucosal immune gene expression of the neonatal pig. The objective of this study was to determine the influence of maternal microbial communities on the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota and mucosal immune gene expression in young pigs reared in a cross-fostering model. Piglets were given high quality colostrum from birth dam or foster dam upon birth. Twenty-four piglets were randomly assigned at birth to 1 of 3 treatments according to colostrum source and postcolostral milk feeding during, as follow: treatment 1 (n = 8), received colostrum and post-colostral milk feeding from their own dam; treatment 2 (n = 8), received colostrum from foster dam and returned to their own dam for post-colostral milk feeding; and treatment 3 (n = 8), received colostrum and post-colostral milk feeding from foster dam. Genomic DNA was extracted, and the V1-V3 hypervariable region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis was also performed to quantify the expression of toll-like receptors (TLR) 2, TLR 4, TLR 10, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), interferon gamma (IFN gamma), and interleukin (IL) 4 and IL 10. Data analysis revealed that microbial communities were varied according to the GI biogeographical location, with colon being the most diverse section. Bacterial communities in both maternal colostrum and vaginal samples were significantly associated with those present in the fecal samples of piglets. Cross-fostering did not affect bacterial communities present in the piglet GI tract. However, the mRNA expression of TLR and inflammatory cytokines changed (P < 0.05) with biogeographical location in the GI tract, Higher mRNA expression of TLR and inflammatory cytokines was observed in ileum and ileum associated lymph tissues. This study suggests an impact of colostrum and maternal microbial communities on the microbiota development and mucosal immune gene expression in the newly born piglet. This study revealed novel information about the distribution and expression patterns of TLR and inflammatory cytokines in the GI tract of the young pig. Future studies are needed to determine the role and clinical importance of the mucosal microbiota and mucosal gene expression in health, productivity, and susceptibility to the development of GI disease, in piglets.",2018,121,10.1016/j.micpath.2018.05.007

The ecological communities which characterize this ecotone, and which provide local and global ecosystem services, are affected by environmental variation at multiple scales. We explored correlations between environmental variables and macroinvertebrate and soil prokaryote communities in the forest-tundra ecotone of the Yukon, Canada. We found that each tussock tundra site possessed a distinct community of macroinvertebrates and prokaryotes, and therefore represented a unique contribution to regional biodiversity. Prokaryote diversity increased with active layer depth, which could be an effect of temperature, or could be evidence of a species-area effect. Prokaryote diversity decreased with lichen cover, which could be due to antimicrobial properties of lichen. The macroinvertebrate community composition was affected by proximity to a human disturbance, the Dempster Highway. Both macroinvertebrate and prokaryote community compositions changed along the latitudinal transect, as the biome transitioned from taiga to tundra. We also found that the abundance of carnivores relative to herbivores decreased with latitude, which adds to recent evidence that predation decreases with latitude. Our survey yielded new insights about how macro- and microorganisms vary together and independently in relation to environmental variables at multiple scales in a forest-tundra ecotone.",2018,41,10.1007/s00300-018-2330-5

To address this research gap, we examined the bacterial spatial turnover rate and the species networks in paired primary and secondary forest soils along a 3700-km north-south transect in eastern China using high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The spatial turnover rate of bacterial communities was higher in primary forests than in secondary, suggesting deforestation increased biotic homogenization at a large geographic scale. Multiple regression on matrices analysis revealed that both geographic distance and soil properties (especially soil pH and organic matter availability) strongly affected bacterial spatial turnover. Through the phylogenetic molecular ecological network approach, we demonstrate that the bacterial network of primary forests was more intricate than in secondary forests. This suggests that microbial species have greater niche-sharing and more interactions in primary forests as compared to secondary forests. On the other hand, the bacterial network in secondary forests was more modular, and the taxa tended to co-occur, with positive correlations accounting for 82% of all potential interactions. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that anthropogenic deforestation has clear effects on bacterial spatial turnover and network interactions, with potential for serious consequences such as microbial diversity loss in primary forests.",2018,123,10.1016/j.soilbio.2018.05.007

Although FeOB have been reported from a wide variety of environments, most of them have not been isolated and their biochemical characteristics remain largely unknown. This is especially true for those living in the marine realm, where the properties of FeOB was not known until the isolation of the Zetaproteobacteria Mariprofundus ferrooxydans, first reported in 2007. Since the proposal of Zetaproteobacteria by Emerson et al., the detection and isolation of those microorganisms from the marine environment has greatly escalated. Furthermore, FeOB have also recently been reported from works on ocean drilling and metal corrosion.

Bacterioplankton communities are essential components in lakes and consist of a few abundant species and several rare taxa. However, little is known about the community diversity and composition of abundant and rare bacterioplankton subjected to different levels of anthropogenic disturbances. In this study, water samples were collected from twelve freshwater lakes located around the city of Nanjing, China. Both Illumina MiSeq sequencing and multivariate statistical analysis were employed to determine the bacterioplankton community composition and its relation to environmental variables. The results indicated that tourism disturbances (mostly sewage discharge and tourist activities) altered the community structure of both abundant and rare bacterioplankton by changing water physicochemical characteristics. Alpha diversity of both abundant and rare taxa did not differ among different anthropogenic disturbance lakes (p > 0.05). Rare bacterial taxa possessed higher alpha diversity than abundant taxa, though rare taxa occupied a tiny portion of abundance (4.5%). Redundancy analysis demonstrated that dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was the most significant correlation variable for constraining the variation of abundant taxa, whereas total phosphorus (TP), ammonium nitrogen (NH4+N), and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) were the most dominant environmental factors constraining the rare taxa, indicating abundant and rare taxa may have different ecological niches.",2018,10,10.3390/w10081075

Here, we applied CARD-FISH to quantify bacterial community structure from the subtropics to Antarctica between 10 degrees W and 10 degrees E, covering four biogeographic provinces with distinct environmental properties. In addition, incorporation of radiolabeled glucose, amino acids and leucine via MAR-FISH served to quantify the contribution to substrate turnover by selected bacterial groups. SAR11, Bacteroidetes, Gammaproteobacteria and the Roseobacter group accounted for the majority of the bacterial community (52%-88% of DAPI-stained cells) but showed little distributional variation between provinces. In contrast, taxonomic subclades Polaribacter, NS5, NS2b (Bacteroidetes) as well as RCA (Roseobacter group) featured marked geographic variation, illustrated by NMDS and coefficients of variation. Roseobacter (specifically RCA) and Gammaproteobacteria constituted considerable fractions of cells incorporating glucose and amino acids respectively. Bacteroidetes had generally lower activities, but Polaribacter accounted for a major fraction of biomass production at one station near the Antarctic ice shelf.

The goal of this study was to understand the geographical distribution of three species of Microbotryum anther-smut fungi that are distantly related but infect the same host plants, the sister species Silenevulgaris and S.uniflora, in Western Europe. We used microsatellite markers to investigate pathogen distribution in relation to host specialization and ecological factors. Microbotryum violaceo-irregulare was only found on S.vulgaris at high elevations in the Alps. Microbotryumlagerheimii could be subdivided into two genetically differentiated clusters, one on S.uniflora in the UK and the second on S.vulgaris in the Alps and Pyrenees. The most abundant pathogen species, M.silenes-inflatae, could be subdivided into four genetic clusters, co-occurring in the Alps, the UK and the Pyrenees, and was found on both S.vulgaris and S.uniflora. All three fungal species had high levels of homozygosity, in agreement with the selfing mating system generally observed in anther-smut fungi. The three pathogen species and genetic clusters had large range overlaps, but occurred at sites with different elevations, temperatures and precipitation levels.

We hypothesize that permafrost communities are shaped by physical constraints imposed by prolonged freezing, and exhibit spatial distributions that reflect dispersal limitation and selective pressures associated with these physical constraints. To test this, we characterized patterns of environmental variation and microbial community composition in permafrost across an Alaskan boreal forest landscape. We used null modeling to estimate the importance of selective and neutral assembly processes on community composition, and identified environmental factors influencing ecological selection through regression and structural equation modeling (SEM). Proportionally, the strongest process influencing community composition was dispersal limitation (0.36), exceeding the influence of homogenous selection (0.21), variable selection (0.16) and homogenizing dispersal (0.05) Fe(II) content was the most important factor explaining variable selection, and was significantly associated with total selection by univariate regression (R-2 = 0.14, P = 0.003). SEM supported a model in which Fe(II) content mediated influences of the Gibbs free energy of the organic matter pool and organic acid concentration on total selection. These findings suggest that the dominant processes shaping microbial communities in permafrost result from the stability of the permafrost environment, which imposes dispersal and thermodynamic constraints.",2018,94,10.1093/femsec/fiy110

We assessed the taxonomic composition (16S rRNA gene sequencing) and metabolic activity (Biolog Ecoplates) of lake bacteria with and without soil addition, and compared these to initial soil communities. Soil bacterial assemblages showed a strong influence of tree composition, but such community differences were not reflected in the structure of lake communities that developed during the experiment.

Here, we performed two investigations of the phytoplankton composition in the lakes of the Yangtze River catchment in China in the spring and summer of 2012, which covered regional spatial scale and two-season temporal scale. We analysed the association between temporal and spatial species turnover in phytoplankton. The results showed that 1) the two-season temporal turnover of phytoplankton varied based on the mean values and the coefficient of variance of environmental variables, and pH was the most important variable negatively affecting the temporal turnover; 2) the spatial beta diversity of phytoplankton in summer was higher than that in spring, and the distance decay pattern was significant in summer, but not in spring; 3) the variation in spatial turnover in spring and summer was attributed to the primary environmental variables (nitrogen, phosphorus and underwater available light) and broader-scale spatial variables; 4) the proportion of jointly explained variation of spatial Bray-Curtis dissimilarity by the environment and space increased from similar to 38% (spring) to similar to 55% (summer), which was mainly due to the variation in spatially structured environmental variables during the two-season temporal turnover, such as pH and ion concentrations; 5) the community compositions in summer were more similar between the lakes with similar two-season temporal turnover. These results indicate that the spatial turnover of phytoplankton composition in summer was partially predetermined by the variation in environmental variables and phytoplankton composition during the process of two-season temporal turnover, and highlight the understanding of temporal variations in spatial beta diversity as well as the underlying assembly mechanisms in phytoplankton.",2018,41,10.1111/ecog.03340

Plankton communities are extremely diverse and geographically variable, and are overwhelmingly composed of low-abundance species. The role of this rare biosphere and its ecological underpinnings are however still unclear. Here, we analyse the extensive dataset generated by the Tara Oceans expedition for marine microbial eukaryotes (protists) and use an adaptive algorithm to explore how metabarcoding-based abundance distributions vary across plankton communities in the global ocean. We show that the decay in abundance of non-dominant operational taxonomic units, which comprise over 99% of local richness, is commonly governed by a power-law. Despite the high spatial turnover in species composition, the power-law exponent varies by less than 10% across locations and shows no biogeographical signature, but is weakly modulated by cell size. Such striking regularity suggests that the assembly of plankton communities in the dynamic and highly variable ocean environment is governed by large-scale ubiquitous processes.

Here, we examined the influence of long-term fertilization (NPKS) and liming (L) on soil bacterial community structure and its co-occurrence networks by sequencing 16S rRNA gene amplicons. Our results showed that liming counteracted the influence of long-term fertilization on soil pH, but not on soluble organic carbon (SOC) and electrical conductivity (EC). Long-term fertilization affected the abundance of Acidobacteriia, Deltaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria in the 0-10 cm soil, and that of Deltaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria and Gemmatimonadetes in the 10-20 cm soil; whereas liming affected the abundance of Acidobacteriia, Gammaproteobacteria, and Chloracidobacteria in the 0-10 cm soil and that of Deltaproteobacteria in the 10-20 cm soil. The bacterial community structure in soils with the NPKS-L treatment was different from that with other treatments, and was mainly affected by SOC, EC, and NO3- concentration. The link numbers in bacterial co-occurrence networks were decreased by long-term fertilization or liming alone, but were increased by the NPKS-L treatment. Notwithstanding the fact that liming alleviates fertilization-induced soil acidification, this study indicates that liming did not counteract the effect of long-term fertilization on soil bacterial community structure and its co-occurrence pattern, hence cannot recuperate the soil microbial functionality that is changed by long-term fertilization.",2018,123,10.1016/j.soilbio.2018.05.003

Despite indications that aphids in the same ecological niche show similar levels of facultative symbiont richness, existing reports do not consider the potential role of host plants on aphid microbial community. Little is known about how oligophagy and polyphagy may be influenced by secondary symbiont distribution, mainly because studies on secondary symbiont diversity are biased towards polyphagous aphids from the Northern Hemisphere. Here, we demonstrate the richness and abundance of the most common aphid-associated facultative symbionts in two tropical aphid species, the oligophagous Aphis (Toxoptera) citricidus (Kirkaldy) (Hemiptera: Aphididae) and the polyphagous Aphis aurantii (Boyer de Fonscolombe) (Hemiptera: Aphididae). Aphis citricidus is restricted to Citrus sp. host plants and closely related genera, whereas A. aurantii successfully exploits a wide variety of host plants from different families. Both were collected in the same ecological niche and our data basically indicated the same richness of secondary symbionts, but the abundance at which secondary symbionts occurred was very distinct between the two species. Spiroplasma was the most abundant facultative symbiont associated with A. citricidus and A. aurantii in the ecological niche studied. Single and multiple secondary symbiont infections were observed, but diversity of multiple infections was particularly high in A. citricidus. We discuss our findings and suggest hypotheses to explain causes and consequences of the differences in secondary symbiont diversity observed between these two aphid species.",2018,47,10.1007/s13744-017-0532-0

Soil microbial taxa showed spatial dependence with an autocorrelation range of 44.4-883.0 m, most of them within the scope of the study plots (500 m). An increasing trend was observed for Alphaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria, and Chloroflexi from north to south in the study area, but an opposite trend for Actinobacteria, Acidobacteira, and Firmicutes was observed. Thaumarchaeota, Bacteroidetes, Gemmatimonadetes, and Verrucomicrobia had patchy patterns, Nitrospirae had a unimodal pattern, and Latescibacteria had an intermittent pattern with low and high value strips. Location, soil total phosphorus, elevation, and plant density were significantly correlated with main soil bacterial taxa in the karst forest. Moreover, the total variation in soil microbial communities better explained by spatial factors than environmental variables. Furthermore, a large part of variation (76.8%) was unexplained in the study.

This vertical community connectivity seems to occur predominantly through the largest particles because communities in the largest size fractions showed the highest taxonomic similarity throughout the water column, whereas free-living communities were more isolated vertically. Our results further suggest that particle colonization processes occurring in surface waters determine to some extent the composition and biogeography of bathypelagic communities. Overall, we postulate that sinking particles function as vectors that inoculate viable particle-attached surface microbes into the deep-sea realm, determining to a considerable extent the structure, functioning, and biogeography of deep ocean communities.",2018,115,10.1073/pnas.1802470115

In our country more than 30 Mha are currently cultivated under no-till schemes, stressing the importance of this management system for crop production. It is widely recognized that soil microbiota is altered under different soil managements. In this regard the structure of Burkholderia populations is affected by soils management practices such as tillage, fertilization, or crop rotation. The stability of these structures, however, has not been evaluated under sustainable schemes where the impact of land practices could be less deleterious to physicochemical soils characteristics. In order to assess the structure of Burkholderia spp. populations in no-till schemes, culturable Burkholderia spp. strains were quantified and their biodiversity evaluated. Results showed that Burkholderia spp. biodiversity, but not their abundance, clearly displayed a dependence on agricultural managements. We also showed that biodiversity was mainly influenced by two soil factors: Total Organic Carbon and Total Nitrogen. Results showed that no-till schemes are not per se sufficient to maintain a richer Burkholderia spp. soil microbiota, and additional traits should be considered when sustainability of productive soils is a goal to fulfil productive agricultural schemes.",2018,13,10.1371/journal.pone.0200651

The chimneys appear to provide habitats for microorganisms that are not found or only detectable in very low numbers in other marine habitats. The chimneys also host rare organisms and may function as a vital part of the oceans seed bank. Many of the reads from active and inactive chimney samples were clustered into OTUs, with low or no resemblance to known species. Since we are unaware of the chemical reactions catalyzed by these unknown organisms, the impact of this diversity loss and bio-geo-coupling is hard to predict.

The gastrointestinal tract (GIT) microbial community has widely acknowledged its vital role in host health, especially in diet digestion; However, no study to date has revealed the GIT microbiota in the red panda. Here, we characterized the microbial biogeographical characteristics in the GIT of a red panda using high-throughput sequencing technology. Significant differences were observed among GIT segments by beta diversity of microbiota, which were divided into four distinct groups: the stomach, small intestine, large intestine, and feces. The stomach and duodenum showed less bacterial diversity, but contained higher bacterial abundance and the most unclassified tags. The number of species in the stomach and small intestine samples was higher than that of the large intestine and fecal samples. A total of 133 core operational taxonomic units were obtained from the GIT samples with 97% sequence identity. Proteobacteria (52.16%), Firmicutes (10.09%), and Bacteroidetes (7.90%) were the predominant phyla in the GIT of the red panda. Interestingly, Escherichia-Shigella were largely abundant in the stomach, small intestine, and feces whereas the abundance of Bacteroides in the large intestine was high.

Bacteria are involved in most biogeochemical processes in the fluvial ecosystem; however, their pattern distribution in a river and its tributaries has not yet been investigated in detail. In the present study, high-throughput sequencing was employed to examine bacterial communities and their co-occurrence networks between Kaidu River and its nine tributaries in northwestern China. The results obtained demonstrated that both bacterial communities shared a similar dominant sub-community, mainly consisting of Actinobacteria. Bacteroidetes. and Proteobacteria, with Limnohabitans and Variovorax as the dominant genera. In spite of these commonalities, bacterial community structures still significantly differed between these two habitats, which may be related to the distance-related dispersal limitation. Their co-occurrence networks were generally both positively structured. The structural analysis showed that OTUs from the same phyla were more likely to co-occur. Although the keystone genera were taxonomically different between Kaidu River and its tributaries, they both shared common trophic properties in exploiting niches under oligotrophic conditions. We noted that their relative abundances were less than 1%, indicating the over-proportional roles of rare genera in the bacterial community. In addition, the inferred networks showed less nodes and edges, but higher modularity in Kaidu River than its tributaries, suggesting the higher fragmentation of the bacterial community in the mainstream.",2018,33,10.1264/jsme2.ME17170

The soil microbial community diversity was analyzed for plant, soil, geographic properties, and pure spatial distance based on a distance-based approach and with variation partitioning based on canonical redundancy analysis. The soil bacteria richness and alpha diversity index showed marginal positive relationship with plant richness and Shannon index. The bacterial community compositions of both the taxonomic and phylogenetic structures were best explained by the soil pH and plant diversity and soil nutrient availability, with the peak richness at pH 6.8. While the plant, soil and geographic factors were correlated with bacteria community dissimilarity, soil pH and plant diversity, nitrogen availability were relatively independent dominant community assemblage by quantifying taxonomic and phylogenetic turnover.

The spatial distributions of microbial community and enzyme activities depending on soil environmental factors were studied using geostatistical tools. 55 soil samples were collected across a 30 m x 40 m plot in a broad-leaved Korean pine mixed forest in the Changbai Mountains. Abundances of total and bacterial PLFAs had stronger spatial dependence than fungal PLFAs. Gram-positive bacteria had stronger spatial dependence than Gram-negative bacteria, suggesting that Gram-negative bacteria are more susceptible to stochastic factors. The proportions of structural variance for the activities of beta-1,4-glucosidase (beta G), beta-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAG) and acid phosphatase (AP) were 0.997, 0.519 and 0.966, respectively, suggesting that beta G and AP had high spatial dependence.

As higher denitrifier diversity can result in higher denitrification rates, here we aimed to understand the diversity, composition and spatial structure of N2O-reducing microbial assemblages in forest soils across a large latitudinal and temperature gradient. 2. We sequenced nosZ gene amplicons of 126 soil samples from six forests with mean annual soil temperatures (MAST) ranging from 3.7 to 25.3 degrees C and tested predictions of the metabolic theory of ecology (MTE) and metabolic-niche theory (MNT). As predicted, -diversity of nosZ communities increased with increasing MAST, within-site -diversity decreased and two (pH and soil moisture) of the three niche widths examined were larger with increasing MAST. 3. We calculated -nearest taxon distance and Raup-Crick metric to quantify the relative influence of the assembly processes determining nosZ assemblage structure. Environmental selection was the primary process driving assemblage structure in all six forests. Homogenizing dispersal was also important at one site, which could be explained by the sites much lower variability in soil chemistry. 4. We used canonical correspondence analysis and multiple regression on matrices to examine relationships between nosZ communities and environmental factors, and found that temperature and spatial distance were significant predictors of nosZ assemblage structure. 5.

Although biotic interactions also underlie the biogeography of plants, the importance of plant-associated microbes is often overlooked when predicting ranges. In particular, symbiotic microbes may influence the distribution of plants that engage in strong interactions with them. We tested whether seedling response to inoculation by ectomycorrhizal fungi explains range size of trees. To examine mechanisms underlying the relationship between range size and response to inoculation, we also examined to what extent sympatry between host and fungi influenced this relationship. Location: Global. Time period: Contemporary. Major taxa studied: Trees and fungi forming ectomycorrhizas. Methods: Using a dataset of 1,275 observations from 126 papers, we calculated mean biomass response (effect size) of 59 tree species to fungal inoculation. We extracted host range area from digitized maps of native distributions, and determined whether hosts were naturally sympatric with fungal species used as inoculum by searching herbaria databases with geospatially referenced data. Results: Tree species with seedling effect sizes falling above or below the average response tended to have small ranges and those with average responses, large ranges. Moreover, hosts inoculated with fungi whose ranges were allopatric to their own had higher biomass compared to those that were inoculated by sympatric fungi, suggesting that the extent of geographical overlap between trees and symbiotic fungi may attenuate the mutualism. Main conclusions: We demonstrate that mycorrhizas may underlie host biogeographical patterns at the continental scale. Our study is novel in the scope of species and scale tested, and points to a possible mechanism underlying this pattern related to the process of mutualism breakdown accruing over time at local geographical scales. For ectomycorrhizal tree species, performance may increase when exposed to fungal partners without a recent shared evolutionary history.",2018,27,10.1111/geb.12745

By contrast, it is unknown whether microbes inhabiting the same ecosystems exhibit similar biogeographic patterns. To evaluate the biogeographies of tropical protists, we used metabarcoding data of species sampled in the soils of three lowland Neotropical rainforests. Taxa-area and distance-decay relationships for three of the dominant protist taxa and their subtaxa were estimated at both the OTU and phylogenetic levels, with presence-absence and abundance-based measures. These estimates were compared to null models. High local alpha and low regional beta diversity patterns were consistently found for both the parasitic Apicomplexa and the largely free-living Cercozoa and Ciliophora. Similar to animals and plants, the protists showed spatial structures between forests at the OTU and phylogenetic levels, and only at the phylogenetic level within forests. These results suggest that the biogeographies of macro- and micro-organismal eukaryotes in lowland Neotropical rainforests are partially structured by the same general processes. However, and unlike the animals and plants, the protist OTUs did not exhibit spatial structures within forests, which hinders our ability to estimate the local and regional diversity of protists in tropical forests.",2018,27,10.1111/mec.14731
"Glassman, SI; Martiny, JBH",Broadscale Ecological Patterns Are Robust to Use of Exact Sequence Variants versus Operational Taxonomic Units,MSPHERE,"Recent discussion focuses on the best method for delineating microbial taxa, based on either exact sequence variants (ESVs) or traditional operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of marker gene sequences. We sought to test if the binning approach (ESVs versus 97% OTUs) affected the ecological conclusions of a large field study. The data set included sequences targeting all bacteria (16S rRNA) and fungi (internal transcribed spacer [ITS]), across multiple environments diverging markedly in abiotic conditions, over three collection times. Despite quantitative differences in microbial richness, we found that all alpha and beta diversity metrics were highly positively correlated (r > 0.90) between samples analyzed with both approaches. Moreover, the community composition of the dominant taxa did not vary between approaches. Consequently, statistical inferences were nearly indistinguishable. Furthermore, ESVs only moderately increased the genetic resolution of fungal and bacterial diversity (1.3 and 2.1 times OTU richness, respectively). We conclude that for broadscale (e.g., all bacteria or all fungi) alpha and beta diversity analyses, ESV or OTU methods will often reveal similar ecological results. Thus, while there are good reasons to employ ESVs, we need not question the validity of results based on OTUs. IMPORTANCE Microbial ecologists have made exceptional improvements in our understanding of microbiomes in the last decade due to breakthroughs in sequencing technologies. These advances have wide-ranging implications for fields ranging from agriculture to human health. Due to limitations in databases, the majority of microbial ecology studies use a binning approach to approximate taxonomy based on DNA sequence similarity. There remains extensive debate on the best way to bin and approximate this taxonomy. Here we examine two popular approaches using a large field-based data set examining both bacteria and fungi and conclude that there are not major differences in the ecological outcomes. Thus, it appears that standard microbial community analyses are not overly sensitive to the particulars of binning approaches.",2018,3,10.1128/mSphere.00148-18

We applied a pyrosequencing approach targeting 165 ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes in soil DNA to a set of 2173 soil samples from France to reach a comprehensive understanding of the spatial distribution of bacteria and archaea and to identify the ecological processes and environmental drivers involved. Taxonomic assignment of the soil 165 rRNA sequences indicated the presence of 32 bacterial phyla or subphyla and 3 archaeal phyla. Twenty of these 35 phyla were cosmopolitan and abundant, with heterogeneous spatial distributions structured in patches ranging from a 43- to 260-km radius. The hierarchy of the main environmental drivers of phyla distribution was soil pH > land management > soil texture > soil nutrients > climate. At a lower taxonomic level, 47 dominant genera belonging to 12 phyla aggregated 62.1% of the sequences. We also showed that the phylum-level distribution can be determined largely by the distribution of the dominant genus or, alternatively, reflect the combined distribution of all of the phylum members. Together, our study demonstrated that soil bacteria and archaea present highly diverse biogeographical patterns on a nationwide scale and that studies based on intensive and systematic sampling on a wide spatial scale provide a promising contribution for elucidating soil biodiversity determinism.",2018,4,10.1126/sciadv.aat1808

In the present study, antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and bacterial communities were characterized using high-throughput quantitative PCR and Illumina HiSeq sequencing, respectively, in soils from a long-term (25 years) field ex. periment. Treatments included no fertilizers (control), chemical fertilizers (NPK), NPK with straw return (NPKS), pig manure (M), and M with chemical fertilizers (NPKM). Both NPK and NPKS decreased soil pH and induced a substantial shift in the bacterial communities, but had only moderate effect on the ARG diversity and abundance. The effect of straw return was hindered by the dominant influence of NPK. In comparison, additions of pig manure (M and NPKM) maintained the diversity of bacterial community and significantly influenced the ARG profiles by introducing extra ARGs from pig manure and boosting the soil indigenous ARG members. Manured soils harboured clusters of ARGs and transposase genes which were relatively independent of bacterial phylogenetic lineages, suggesting a strong co-occurrence of ARGs in soil bacteria which may result from horizontal gene transfers (HGT).

The occurrence and importance of horizontal transfer of rhizobial symbiosis genes within and between bacterial genera were assessed. Horizontal transfer of symbiosis genes between rhizobial strains is of common occurrence, is widespread geographically, is not restricted to specific rhizobial genera, and occurs within and between rhizobial genera. The transfer of symbiosis genes to bacteria adapted to local soil conditions can allow these bacteria to become rhizobial symbionts of previously incompatible legumes growing in these soils. This, in turn, will have consequences for the growth, life history, and biogeography of the legume species involved, which provides a critical ecological link connecting the horizontal transfer of symbiosis genes between rhizobial bacteria in the soil to the above-ground floral biodiversity and vegetation community structure.",2018,9,10.3390/genes9070321

However, the characteristics and internal mechanisms of variation of bacterial community structure over different reclamation periods are currently unclear. The recovery and evolution of soil microbial community structure are important indicators of the level of soil quality improvement of reclaimed soil. Therefore, this study investigated soil samples from coal gangue-filled land after reclamation periods of 1, 6, and 15 years. To accomplish this, 16S rRNA gene libraries were produced to determine the microbial community composition of the soils. In addition, various soil microbial community characteristics in the filled reclamation areas were compared with soil samples from areas unaffected by coal mining. The results showed the following: (1) The diversity and abundance of bacterial communities in reclaimed soils was slightly different from that of natural soils. However, the soil bacterial community structure was highly similar to natural soil after a 15-year reclamation period; therefore, the recovery of bacterial communities can be used as an indicator of the effects of rehabilitation. (2) Some soil physicochemical properties are significantly correlated with the main bacteria in the soil. (3) The dominant bacteria included members of the phyla Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, as well as members of the genera Bacillus, Enterococcus, and Lactococcus.

To assess the role of species traits related to dispersal capacities in diatom biogeography. Location Rivers and streams of Sweden sampled over a total area of 450,000km(2). MethodsWe used partial redundancy analyses and variation partitioning coupled with spatial eigenfunctions analyses to separate the effects of environment and space at three different scales on diatoms community structure. As community analyses might give limited insight into species-specific mechanisms, we also performed species by species variation partitioning and the amount of variance explained by each fraction was related to species cell length and attachment to the substrate. Results We found a strong effect of environment and space at a large scale suggesting environmental filtering and dispersal limitation over large distances. Additionally, species-based analyses uncovered an effect of space at fine scale suggesting possible species-specific mass effect dynamic or species sorting driven by missing environmental factors varying at fine scale. Environmental and spatial effects varied strongly among species, but this variation was not explained by cell length and attachment to the substrate. Main conclusions Our results confirm the importance of both environment and dispersal-related processes in controlling diatom community structure and bring new perspectives on the role of dispersal in shaping microbial communities at biogeographical scale. Dispersal being a species-specific mechanism, species associations are not necessarily conserved from site to site and species-based approaches can detect different spatial patterns than those derived from traditional community analyses.

We analysed the distribution patterns of benthic diatoms (unicellular siliceous algae) as a model group of microbial passive dispersers, including predictors that describe limnological and geo-climatic gradients for a total of 113 waterbodies (0-28 degrees S and 58-80 degrees W), including lakes and streams. Complementary multivariate statistical analyses were performed to correlate (1) community composition and (2) diatom species richness with environmental and spatial factors to infer niche-based and dispersal-based assembly processes, respectively. 3. Results showed that two gradients structured both diatom assemblages and waterbodies, namely climate and landscape configuration. Variance partitioning revealed that broadscale spatial variables (distance-based Morans Eigenvectors) outperformed the two environmental components (limnological and geo-climatic), suggesting dispersal-assembled communities. However, diatom assemblages were structured by geo-climatic (regional) factors in certain lakes in the northern and central Andes, although their effects were partially manifested via local variables after the geographical distances were factored out. In a similar way, climatic and topographic structuring homogenized lake and stream communities within ecoregions, as indicated by the strong overlap between the two community types and the weak correlation between biota and limnological variables. Notably, a significant increase in diatom species richness was related to increased water connectivity, interpreted to indicate that a decrease in the remoteness of the system increase species number. 4. Synthesis. We emphasize the strength of macroecological gradients (landscape configuration and climatic factors) in affecting both diatom diversity and community composition in the South American tropics. In this context, our results and the commonalities of ecoregion patterning with groups of macro-organisms (vegetation) suggest the need to integrate microbial ecology into a macroecology framework to unravel mechanisms behind diversity gradients.",2018,106,10.1111/1365-2745.12934

Genomic variation in haloarchaea has been linked to viral infection pressure and, in the case of Antarctic communities, can be caused by intergenera gene exchange. To expand understanding of genome variation and biogeography of Antarctic haloarchaea, here we assessed genomic variation between two strains of Halorubrum lacusprofundi that were isolated from Antarctic hypersaline lakes from different regions (Vestfold Hills and Rauer Islands). To assess variation in haloarchaeal populations, including the presence of genomic islands, metagenomes from six hypersaline Antarctic lakes were characterised. Results: The sequence of the largest replicon of each Hrr. lacusprofundi strain (primary replicon) was highly conserved, while each of the strains two smaller replicons (secondary replicons) were highly variable. Intergenera gene exchange was identified, including the sharing of a type I-B CRISPR system. Evaluation of infectivity of an Antarctic halovirus provided experimental evidence for the differential susceptibility of the strains, bolstering inferences that strain variation is important for modulating interactions with viruses. A relationship was found between genomic structuring and the location of variation within replicons and genomic islands, demonstrating that the way in which haloarchaea accommodate genomic variability relates to replicon structuring. Metagenome read and contig mapping and clustering and scaling analyses demonstrated biogeographical patterning of variation consistent with environment and distance effects. The metagenome data also demonstrated that specific haloarchaeal species dominated the hypersaline systems indicating they are endemic to Antarctica. Conclusion: The study describes how genomic variation manifests in Antarctic-lake haloarchaeal communities and provides the basis for future assessments of Antarctic regional and global biogeography of haloarchaea.",2018,6,10.1186/s40168-018-0495-3

Here, we used high-throughput sequencing to compare the bacterial distributions in the bulk soil, rhizosphere, and endosphere across 51 soybean fields in China. Environmental variables were more important than spatial variables, and edaphic variables were more important than climatic variables, for governing bacterial community turnover in each soil-root compartment. Both bacterial richness and community turnover were significantly correlated with different environmental and spatial variables among the three compartments. Their different spatial autocorrelation ranges for bacteria suggested distinct bacterial biogeographic patterns were present. The distributions of nearest taxon index (NTI) showed that deterministic processes dominated local bacterial communities, while its importance decreased from the bulk soil to the endosphere.

The distance-decay relationship, the change in species composition similarity between different communities over a geographic distance, is a commonly observed biogeographic pattern. To study biogeographic patterns and the corresponding driving forces, the bacterial distance-decay patterns along the horizontal and vertical dimensions in the South China Sea (SCS) were investigated through the sequencing of partial 16 S rRNA gene regions. Along the horizontal geographical distances (up to similar to 1000 km), no significant distance-decay pattern in community compositions was observed in any of the tested seawater layers. However, vertical depths (up to similar to 4 km) had strong effects on bacterial community variation, which was apparently governed by dispersal barriers due to limited water mass mixing. In addition, community variations in the vertical direction were strongly correlated with the prominent variation of environmental factors. Apparently, the changes in bacterial community compositions along vertical distances were much greater than those along horizontal distances. The results showed that the distance-decay relationship in bacterial communities at the medium spatial scale was associated with vertical depth rather than with horizontal distance, even though the horizontal distance is much larger than the vertical distance in the open SCS.",2018,8,10.1038/s41598-018-27191-w

Unraveling the nature and mechanisms of these complex associations will require large longitudinal studies, for which bronchoscopy is poorly suited. Studies of samples obtained by sputum induction and nasopharyngeal brushing or lavage have also reported asthma-associated microbiota characteristics. It remains unknown, however, whether the microbiota detected in these less-invasive sample types reflect the composition of bronchial microbiota in asthma. Results: Bacterial microbiota in paired protected bronchial brushings (BB; n = 45), induced sputum (IS; n = 45), oral wash (OW; n = 45), and nasal brushings (NB; n = 27) from adults with mild atopic asthma (AA), atopy without asthma (ANA), and healthy controls (HC) were profiled using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Though microbiota composition varied with sample type (p < 0.001), compositional similarity was greatest for BB-IS, particularly in AAs and ANAs. The abundance of genera detected in BB correlated with those detected in IS and OW (r median [IQR] 0.869 [0.748-0.942] and 0.822 [0.687-0.909] respectively), but not with those in NB (r = 0.004 [-0.003-0.011]). The number of taxa shared between IS-BB and NB-BB was greater in AAs than in HCs (p < 0.05) and included taxa previously associated with asthma. Of the genera abundant in NB, only Moraxella correlated positively with abundance in BB; specific members of this genus were shared between the two compartments only in AAs. Relative abundance of Moraxella in NB of AAs correlated negatively with that of Corynebacterium but positively with markers of eosinophilic inflammation in the blood and BAL fluid. The genus, Corynebacterium, trended to dominate all NB samples of HCs but only half of AAs (p = 0.07), in whom abundance of this genus was negatively associated with markers of eosinophilic inflammation. Conclusions: Induced sputum is superior to nasal brush or oral wash for assessing bronchial microbiota composition in asthmatic adults. Although compositionally similar to the bronchial microbiota, the microbiota in induced sputum are distinct, reflecting enrichment of oral bacteria. Specific bacterial genera are shared between the nasal and the bronchial mucosa which are associated with markers of systemic and bronchial inflammation.",2018,6,10.1186/s40168-018-0487-3

In contrast, recent biological studies provide clear evidence for long-term in situ persistence throughout glacial times within most extant Antarctic faunal and several microbial groups. However, even now, the evolutionary history of the Antarctic flora-despite playing major role in Antarctic ecosystems- remains poorly studied. We assessed the diversity, richness and relative age divergences within Schistidium (Grimmiaceae, Bryophyta), the most species-rich plant genus in the Antarctic, as well as the plant genus containing most Antarctic endemic species. We applied phylogenetic and molecular dating methods based on nuclear ribosomal Internal Transcribed Spacer sequences, including all known Antarctic Schistidium species with available sample material. We additionally investigated the continent-wide genetic diversity within the most common Antarctic representative of the genus-the endemic species Schistidium antarctici-and performed preliminary phylogeographic analyses of the bipolar species Schistidium rivulare. Most previously described Antarctic Schistidium species were genetically distinct, confirming their specific status. Interspecific divergences of all species took place at least similar to 1 Mya, suggesting a likely in situ persistence in Antarctica for (at least) all endemic Schistidium species. The widespread endemic species, Schistidium antarctici, diverged from other Antarctic congeners in the late Miocene, thereby revealing the oldest extant plant species currently known in Antarctica, and providing increasing support for the hypothesis of vegetation survival through multiple glacial periods. Within S. antarctic! we identified several distinct clades dividing the eastern Antarctic Peninsula and Scotia Arc islands from the western Antarctic Peninsula and all continental locations. This suggests that the mountainous spine on the Antarctic Peninsula forms a strong barrier to gene flow in this species, while increased genetic diversity in the northern Maritime Antarctic indicates likely glacial refugia in this area. This study provides an important first step toward assessing the diversity and evolutionary history of the most speciose moss genus in the Antarctic. The multi-million year presence of several endemic species contributes to studies on their adaptive potential to survive climate change over both historical and contemporary timescales.",2018,6,10.3389/fevo.2018.00077
"Kumar, J; Atri, NS",Studies on Ectomycorrhiza: An Appraisal,BOTANICAL REVIEW,"Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi are obligate symbionts of dominant vascular plants, liverworts and hornworts. There are reports of about 20,000 to 25,000 ECM fungi that promote plant growth by facilitating enhanced water and nutrient absorption, and provide tolerance to environmental stresses. These below-ground fungi play a key role in terrestrial ecosystems as they regulate plant diversity, nutrient and carbon cycles, and influence soil structure and ecosystem multifunctionality. Because ECM fungi are obligate root symbionts, host plant can have a strong effect on ECM species richness and community composition. The biogeographic pattern and detailed functioning and regulation of these mycorrhizosphere processes are still poorly understood and require detailed study. More recent researches have placed emphasis on a wider, multifunctional perspective, including the effects of ectomycorrhizal symbiosis on plant and microbial communities, and on ecosystem processes. Over the years the main focus in ECM research has been on the study of diversity and specificity of ECM strains, the role of ECM in regeneration of degraded ecosystem, the growth and establishment of seedlings through nutrient acquisition and the mediation of plant responses to various types of stress. In this review, recent progresses in ectomycorrhizal biology are presented, especially the potential role of ECM symbioses in resistance or tolerance to various biotic and abiotic stresses, and in maintinance of plant diversity for proper ecosystem functioning.",2018,84,10.1007/s12229-017-9196-z

Here, we investigated this question in a set of planktonic lake microbiotas in Eastern Antarctica that represent a natural community ecology experiment. Most of the analysed lakes emerged from the sea during the last 6000 years, giving rise to waterbodies that originally contained marine microbiotas and that subsequently evolved into habitats ranging from freshwater to hypersaline. We show that habitat diversification has promoted selection driven by the salinity gradient in bacterial communities (explaining approximate to 72% of taxa turnover), while microeukaryotic counterparts were predominantly structured by ecological drift (approximate to 72% of the turnover). Nevertheless, we also detected a number of microeukaryotes with specific responses to salinity, indicating that albeit minor, selection has had a role in the structuring of specific members of their communities. In sum, we conclude that microeukaryotes and bacteria inhabiting the same communities can be structured predominantly by different processes. This should be considered in future studies aiming to understand the mechanisms that shape microbial assemblages.",2018,20,10.1111/1462-2920.14265

We sampled 266 soil cores from six conifer-dominated forests, and collected EM roots for fungal species identification based on internal transcribed spacer sequences. We found that EM fungal communities were primarily influenced by contemporary climate, but not significantly by the geographic barrier or spatial distance. Fungal OTUs appeared to be widespread in the Holarctic regions, suggesting long-distance dispersal capabilities or ancient migrations before the separation of Japanese islands from the continent.

Increasing anthropogenic disturbance poses a threat to AM fungal communities worldwide, but there is little empirical evidence about its potential negative consequences. In this global study, we sequenced AM fungal DNA in soil samples collected from pairs of natural (undisturbed) and anthropogenic (disturbed) plots in two ecosystem types (10 naturally wooded and six naturally unwooded ecosystems). We found that ecosystem type had stronger directional effects than anthropogenic disturbance on AM fungal alpha and beta diversity. However, disturbance increased alpha and beta diversity at sites where natural diversity was low and decreased diversity at sites where natural diversity was high. Cultured AM fungal taxa were more prevalent in anthropogenic than natural plots, probably due to their efficient colonization strategies and ability to recover from disturbance. We conclude that anthropogenic disturbance does not have a consistent directional effect on AM fungal diversity; rather, disturbance equalizes levels of diversity at large scales and causes changes in community functional structure.",2018,24,10.1111/gcb.14131

Microbial biogeographic patterns almost always appear to be weaker than those reported for plant and animal taxa. It is as yet unclear why this is the case. Some argue that microbial diversity scales differently over space because microbial taxa are fundamentally different in their abundance, longevity and dispersal abilities. Others have argued that differences in scaling are an artifact of how we assess microbial biogeography, driven, for example, by differences in taxonomic resolution, spatial scale, sampling effort or community activity/dormancy. We tested these alternative explanations by comparing bacterial biogeographic patterns in soil to those of trees found in a forest in Gabon. Altering taxonomic resolution, excluding inactive individuals, or adjusting for differences in spatial scale were insufficient to change the rate of microbial taxonomic turnover. In contrast, we account for the differences in spatial turnover between these groups by equalizing sampling extent. Our results suggest that spatial scaling differences between microbial and plant diversity are likely not due to fundamental differences in biology, and that sampling extent should be taken into account when comparing the biogeographic patterns of microorganisms and larger organisms.",2018,12,10.1038/s41396-018-0103-3

Day-to-day water stagnation in building plumbing can potentially result in water quality deterioration (e.g., lead release or pathogen proliferation), which is a major public health concern. However, little is known about the microbial ecosystem processes in plumbing systems, hindering the development of biological monitoring strategies. Here, we track tap water microbiome assembly in situ, showing that bacterial community composition changes rapidly from the city supply following similar to 6-day stagnation, along with an increase in cell count from 10(3) cells/mL to upwards of 7.8 x 10(5) cells/mL. Remarkably, bacterial community assembly was highly reproducible in this built environment system (median Spearman correlation between temporal replicates = 0.78). Using an island biogeography model, we show that neutral processes arising from the microbial communities in the city water supply (i.e., migration and demographic stochasticity) explained the island community composition in proximal pipes (Goodness-of-fit = 0.48), yet declined as water approached the faucet (Goodness-of-fit = 0.21). We developed a size-effect model to simulate this process, which indicated that pipe diameter drove these changes by mediating the kinetics of hypochlorite decay and cell detachment, affecting selection, migration, and demographic stochasticity. Our study challenges current water quality monitoring practice worldwide which ignore biological growth in plumbing, and suggests the island biogeography model as a useful framework to evaluate building water system quality.",2018,12,10.1038/S41396-018-0101-5

A greenhouse experiment was conducted using 21 agro-soils from 19 provinces in China. Abiotic and biotic disturbances, including treating the soils with sterile water, crude oil, and/or an invasive plant, altered the bacterial community structure in the soils, increased bacterial richness, and reduced bacterial dispersion. Oil contamination exerted stronger effects on the bacterial alpha- and beta-diversity than plant growth. The different responses of bacterial communities and the core microbiome indicated that the disturbances shifted the prevalent soil microbial groups in agro-ecosystems. Among different sampling sites, community dissimilarity increased with spatial distance. Edaphic factors (deterministic processes) exerted the primary influence on the assembly of soil microbiomes in agricultural fields, whereas geographic factors (stochastic processes) were less influential.

It has the greatest number of endemic species in North America, containing abundant living microbialites (including stromatolites and microbial mats) and diverse microbial communities. With the hypothesis that this high biodiversity and the geographic structure should be reflected in the virome, the viral communities in 11 different locations of three drainage systems, Churince, La Becerra, and Pozas Rojas, and in the intestinal contents of 3 different fish species, were analyzed for both eukaryotic and prokaryotic RNA and DNA viruses using next-generation sequencing methods. Double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) virus families were the most abundant (72.5% of reads), followed by single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) viruses (2.9%) and ssRNA and dsRNA virus families (0.5%). Thirteen families had dsDNA genomes, five had ssDNA, three had dsRNA, and 16 had ssRNA. A highly diverse viral community was found, with an ample range of hosts and a strong geographical structure, with very even distributions and signals of endemicity in the phylogenetic trees from several different virus families. The majority of viruses found were bacteriophages but eukaryotic viruses were also frequent, and the large diversity of viruses related to algae were a surprise, since algae are not evident in the previously analyzed aquatic systems of this ecosystem. Animal viruses were also frequently found, showing the large diversity of aquatic animals in this oasis, where plants, protozoa, and archaea are rare. IMPORTANCE In this study, we tested whether the high biodiversity and geographic structure of CCB is reflected in its virome. CCB is an extraordinarily biodiverse oasis in the Chihuahuan desert, where a previous virome study suggested that viruses had followed the marine ancestry of the marine bacteria and, as a result of their long isolation, became endemic to the site. In this study, which includes a larger sequencing coverage and water samples from other sites within the valley, we confirmed the high virus biodiversity and uniqueness as well as the strong biogeographical diversification of the CCB. In addition, we also analyzed fish intestinal contents, finding that each fish species eats different prey and, as a result, presents different viral compositions even if they coexist in the same pond.

C-score analysis was carried out, at intra- and interlake scales, to examine whether phytoplankton species coexist less or more than expected by chance (taxa segregation and aggregation, respectively). Our results showed that, at broader spatial scales, both PRP and EUP distributions are mainly influenced by pure space, while at finer spatial scales, the two groups are mainly influenced by pure environment. PRP distribution at broader spatial scales was also significantly influenced by spatially structured environment, and was in general more affected by spatial variables than by EUP.

The composition of both the Pseudomonas communities and disease suppressive functional genes were responsive to land use. Underlying soil properties explained 37% of the variation in Pseudomonas community structure and up to 61% of the variation in the abundance of disease suppressive functional genes. Notably, measures of soil organic matter quality, C:P ratio, and aromaticity of the dissolved organic matter content (carbon recalcitrance), influenced both the taxonomic and functional disease suppressive potential of the pasture soils. Our results suggest that key components of the soil microbial community may be managed on-farm to enhance disease suppression and plant productivity.",2018,13,10.1371/journal.pone.0196581

This is especially true on Deception Island, where geothermal, marine, and polar environments combine to create an extraordinary range of environmental conditions. Our main goal in this study was to understand how microbial community structure is shaped by gradients of temperature, salinity, and geochemistry in polar marine volcanoes. Thereby, we collected surface sediment samples associated with fumaroles and glaciers at two sites on Deception, with temperatures ranging from 0 to 98 degrees C. Sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene was performed to assess the composition and diversity of Bacteria and Archaea. Our results revealed that Deception harbors a combination of taxonomic groups commonly found both in cold and geothermal environments of continental Antarctica, and also groups normally identified at deep and shallow-sea hydrothermal vents, such as hyperthermophilic archaea. We observed a clear separation in microbial community structure across environmental gradients, suggesting that microbial community structure is strongly niche driven on Deception. Bacterial community structure was significantly associated with temperature, pH, salinity, and chemical composition; in contrast, archaeal community structure was strongly associated only with temperature. Our work suggests that Deception represents a peculiar open-air laboratory to elucidate central questions regarding molecular adaptability, microbial evolution, and biogeography of extremophiles in polar regions.",2018,9,10.3389/fmicb.2018.00899

Such adaptation can change the molecular signatures of communities with differences in taxonomic and functional composition. Understanding the relationship between taxonomic and functional variation remains a critical issue in microbial ecology. Here, we assessed the taxonomic and functional diversity of a lake metacommunity system along a polymetallic pollution gradient caused by 60 years of chronic exposure to acid mine drainage (AMD). Our results highlight three adaptive signatures. First, a signature of taxon-function decoupling was detected in the microbial communities of moderately and highly polluted lakes. Second, parallel shifts in taxonomic composition occurred between polluted and unpolluted lakes. Third, variation in the abundance of functional modules suggested a gradual deterioration of ecosystem services (i.e., photosynthesis) and secondary metabolism in highly polluted lakes. Overall, changes in the abundance of taxa, function, andmore importantly the polymetallic resistance genes such as copA, copB, czcA, cadR, cCusA, were correlated with trace metal content (mainly Cadmium) and acidity. Our findings highlight the impact of polymetallic pollution gradient at the lowest trophic levels.",2018,9,10.3389/fmicb.2018.00869

As parasites of plants, animals and even of larger protists, they regulate populations and shape communities. Pathogenic forms play a major role in public health issues as human parasites, or act as agricultural pests. Predatory soil protists release nutrients enhancing plant growth. Soil protists are of key importance for our understanding of eukaryotic evolution and microbial biogeography. Soil protists are also useful in applied research as bioindicators of soil quality, as models in ecotoxicology and as potential biofertilizers and biocontrol agents.

Evolution toward GC-poor genomes has been considered a major adaptive pathway in the oligotrophic ocean, but GC-rich bacteria are also prevalent and highly successful in this environment. We quantify the contribution of multiple factors to the change of genomic GC content of Ruegeria pomeroyi DSS-3, a representative and GC-rich member in the globally abundant Roseobacter Glade, using an agent-based model. The model simulates 2 x 10(8) cells, which allows random genetic drift to act in a realistic manner. Each cell has a whole genome subject to base-substitution mutation and recombination, which affect the carbon and nitrogen requirements of DNA and protein pools. Nonsynonymous changes can be functionally deleterious. Together, these factors affect the growth and fitness. Simulations show that experimentally determined mutation bias toward GC is not sufficient to build the GC-rich genome of DSS-3. While nitrogen availability has been repeatedly hypothesized to drive the evolution of GC content in marine bacterioplankton, our model instead predicts that DSS-3 and its ancestors have been evolving in environments primarily limited by carbon.",2018,12,10.1038/s41396-017-0023-7

In laboratory models, QS allows bacteria to monitor and respond to their own cell density and is critical for fitness. However, how QS proceeds in natural, spatially structured bacterial communities is not well understood, which significantly hampers our understanding of the emergent properties of natural communities. To address this gap, we assessed QS signaling in the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa in a cystic fibrosis (CF) lung infectionmodel that recapitulates the biogeographical aspects of the natural human infection. In this model, P. aeruginosa grows as spatially organized, highly dense aggregates similar to those observed in the human CF lung. By combining this natural aggregate system with a micro-3D-printing platform that allows for confinement and precise spatial positioning of P. aeruginosa aggregates, we assessed the impact of aggregate size and spatial positioning on both intra-and interaggregate signaling. We discovered that aggregates containing similar to 2,000 signal-producing P. aeruginosa were unable to signal neighboring aggregates, while those containing >= 5,000 cells signaled aggregates as far away as 176 mu m. Not all aggregates within this calling distance responded, indicating that aggregates have differential sensitivities to signal. Overexpression of the signal receptor increased aggregate sensitivity to signal, suggesting that the ability of aggregates to respond is defined in part by receptor levels. These studies provide quantitative benchmark data for the impact of spatial arrangement and phenotypic heterogeneity on P. aeruginosa signaling in vivo.",2018,115,10.1073/pnas.1719317115

Regional differences in CH4 emission is possibly due to microbial biogeographic distribution. Here we collected soils from 19 wetlands from different regions in China. The methane production capacity (MPC) was measured for each soil samples and varied from 1.11 to 841.94 mg/kg dry soil. High throughput sequencing was employed to investigate the diversity and composition of bacterial, archaeal and methanogenic communities. Similar biogeographic patterns for bacterial, archaeal and methanogenic communities along the latitudinal gradient were observed, and the biogeographic assemblies of different microbial groups were driven by concurrent factors, including edaphic variables (total organic carbon, total phosphorus and pH) and climatic variables (annual frost days, mean annual temperature, direct solar radiation and mean annual precipitation). MPC was significantly correlated with TOC concentration, and in addition, various functional taxa were positively correlated with MPC (P < 0.05), for example, Sphingomonas, Syntrophomonas, Methanospirillum and Methanoregula, indicating their potential contributions in the methanogenic process, and many of them were fermentative bacteria and methanogens. Network analysis showed that some syntrophs, sulfate-reducers and methanogens were tightly co-occurred in one module, suggesting their involvements in cross-linked functional processes.

Here we conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the responses of soil microbial diversity and composition to N addition. Overall, we found N addition decreased both soil microbial diversity and the relative abundance of Actinobacteria and Nitrospirae, although the effect may vary among different ecosystems. The effect size on microbial Shannon index was positively correlated with the changes in soil microbial biomass under N addition. The initial soil conditions, the duration of treatment, the N addition rate and changes in soil organic carbon under N addition all affected the effect sizes of N addition on microbial Shannon index, while changes in soil pH played a minor role.

Despite their prominent role in the primary production and nutrient cycling in Antarctic lakes, cyanobacteria were only poorly represented in the biological dataset used to delineate these ACBRs. Here, we provide a first high-throughput sequencing insight into the spatial distribution of benthic cyanobacterial communities in Antarctic lakes located in four distinct, geographically distant ACBRs and covering a range of limnological conditions. Cyanobacterial community structure differed between saline and freshwater lakes. No clear bioregionalization was observed, as clusters of community similarity encompassed lakes from distinct ACBRs. Most phylotypes (77.0%) were related to cyanobacterial lineages (defined at >= 99.0% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity) restricted to the cold biosphere, including lineages potentially endemic to Antarctica (55.4%). The latter were generally rare and restricted to a small number of lakes, while more ubiquitous phylotypes were generally abundant and present in different ACBRs. These results point to a widespread distribution of some cosmopolitan cyanobacterial phylotypes across the different Antarctic ice-free regions, but also suggest the existence of dispersal barriers both within and between Antarctica and the other continents.",2018,94,10.1093/femsec/fiy042

In addition to morphological data accumulated over two centuries, most known families and common genera have been linked to DNA sequences in relatively recent barcoding efforts. This backbone of morphologically identified sequences is used here to classify environmental sequences in order to study global and local spatial trends. Analyses of tintinnid SSU rDNA data collected worldwide (about 900 sequences available in NCBI GenBank) and in the northwest Atlantic Ocean (about 500,000 sequences obtained by metabarcoding) support distribution patterns related to salinity, bathymetry and climate/latitude. In addition to the marine-freshwater dichotomy and a pattern of coastal-only taxa known for tintinnids, there is a global trend of phylotypes restricted to brackish or open waters. Local alpha and beta diversity analyses show that assemblage differences among estuarine, coastal and open waters are not significant regarding richness, but are significant in terms of phylogenetic composition. We also confirm spatial restriction of boreal and austral taxa, and stress that cosmopolitanism cannot be assessed by molecular methods that lump data from potentially endemic and commonly widespread taxa. Heterogeneous diversity, biogeography and phylogenetic resolution within and among tintinnid lineages raise questions about the processes that promote their diversification and determine their spatial distributions.",2018,40,10.1093/plankt/fby011

To date, the biogeographic patterns of the microbial communities have rarely been reported at a basin scale in the SCS. In this study, the bacterial assemblages inhabiting the epipelagic zone across 110 degrees E to 119 degrees E along 14 degrees N latitude were uncovered. The vertical stratification of both bacterial taxa and their potential functions were revealed. These results suggest that the water depth-specific environment is a driver of the vertical bacterioplankton distribution. Moreover, the bacterial communities were different between the eastern stations and the western stations, where the environmental conditions were distinct. However, the mesoscale eddy did not show an obvious effect on the bacterial community due to the large distance between the sampling site and the center of the eddy. In addition to the water depth and longitudinal location of the samples, the heterogeneity of the phosphate and salinity concentrations also significantly contributed to the variance in the epipelagic bacterial community in the SCS. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to report that the variability in epipelagic bacterioplankton is driven by the physicochemical environment at the basin scale in the SCS.

However, while the urban soil microbiota underpin these services, we still have limited understanding of the factors that influence their distribution. We characterized soil bacterial communities from turf-grasses associated with urban parks, streets, and residential sites across a major urban environment, including a gradient of human population density. Bacterial diversity was significantly positively correlated with the population density; and species diversity was greater in park and street soils, compared to residential soils. Population density and greenspace type also led to significant differences in the microbial community composition that was also significantly correlated with soil pH, moisture, and texture. Co-occurrence network analysis revealed that microbial guilds in urban soils were well correlated. Abundant soil microbes in high density population areas had fewer interactions, while abundant bacteria in high moisture soils had more interactions. These results indicate the significant influence of changes in urban demographics and land-use on soil microbial communities.

However, others have argued for revision of LTREE efforts given perceived limitations in current research priorities and approaches. Yet most arguments about the benefits and failings of LTREE could be argued to reflect the views of only the limited number of scientists who have authored reports on the field, and not the wider community of ecological and evolutionary scientists. To more systematically and quantitatively assess the views of the community on LTREE contributions and future activities, we conducted and here report the results of a survey of ecological and evolutionary scientists at primarily U.S.-based institutions, completed by 1,179 respondents. The survey objectives were to (1) identify and prioritize research questions that are important to address through long-term, ecological field experiments and (2) understand the role that these experiments might play in generating and applying ecological and evolutionary knowledge. Almost 80% (n = 936) of respondents said that long-term experiments had contributed a great deal to ecological understanding. Compared to other research approaches (e.g., short-term, single-site, modeling, or lab), there was overwhelming support that multi-site, long-term research was very important for advancing theory, and that both observational and experimental approaches were required. Respondents identified a wide range of research questions for LTREE to address. The most common topic was the impact of global change (n = 1,352), likely because these processes play out over many years, requiring LTREE approaches to fully understand. Another recurrent theme was the potential of LTREE approaches to build evolutionary understanding across all levels of ecological organization. Critical obstacles preventing some scientists from engaging in LTREE included short-term funding mechanisms and fewer publications, whereas the longer-term value for advancing knowledge and an individuals career were widely recognized. Substantive advances in understanding ecological and evolutionary dynamics then seem likely to be made through engagement in long-term observational and experimental research. However, wider engagement seems dependent on a more supportive research environment and funding structure, through increased institutional acknowledgment of the contributions of long-term research, and greater program support during the establishment and maintenance of research.",2018,88,10.1002/ecm.1289
"Angermeyer, A; Crosby, SC; Huber, JA",Salt marsh sediment bacterial communities maintain original population structure after transplantation across a latitudinal gradient,PEERJ,"Dispersal and environmental selection are two of the most important factors that govern the distributions of microbial communities in nature. While dispersal rates are often inferred by measuring the degree to which community similarity diminishes with increasing geographic distance, determining the extent to which environmental selection impacts the distribution of microbes is more complex. To address this knowledge gap, we performed a large reciprocal transplant experiment to simulate the dispersal of US East Coast salt marsh Spartina alterniflora rhizome-associated microbial sediment communities across a latitudinal gradient and determined if any shifts in microbial community composition occurred as a result of the transplantation. Using bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we did not observe large-scale changes in community composition over a five-month S. alterniflora summer growing season and found that transplanted communities more closely resembled their origin sites than their destination sites. Furthermore, transplanted communities grouped predominantly by region, with two sites from the north and three sites to the south hosting distinct bacterial taxa, suggesting that sediment communities transplanted from north to south tended to retain their northern microbial distributions, and south to north maintained a southern distribution. A small number of potential indicator 16S rRNA gene sequences had distributions that were strongly correlated to both temperature and nitrogen, indicating that some organisms are more sensitive to environmental factors than others. These results provide new insight into the microbial biogeography of salt marsh sediments and suggest that established bacterial communities in frequently-inundated environments may be both highly resistant to invasion and resilient to some environmental shifts. However, the extent to which environmental selection impacts these communities is taxon specific and variable, highlighting the complex interplay between dispersal and environmental selection for microbial communities in nature.",2018,6,10.7717/peerj.4735

Factors that control gland colonization are poorly understood, but bacterial chemotaxis aids occupation of these sites. We report here that a Helicobacter pylori cytoplasmic chemoreceptor, TlpD, is required for gland colonization in the stomach. tlpD mutants demonstrate gland colonization defects characterized by a reduction in the percentage of glands colonized but not in the number of bacteria per gland. Consistent with TlpDs reported role in reactive oxygen species (ROS) avoidance, tlpD mutants showed hallmarks of exposure to high ROS. To assess the role of host-generated ROS in TlpD-dependent gland colonization, we utilized mice that lack either the ability to generate epithelial hydrogen peroxide or immune cell superoxide. tlpD gland colonization defects were rescued to wild-type H. pylori levels in both of these mutants. These results suggest that multiple types of innate immune-generated ROS production limit gland colonization and that bacteria have evolved specific mechanisms to sense and direct their motility in response to this signal and thus spread throughout tissue.",2018,86,10.1128/IAI.00878-17

Given the generally low C/N ratios of paddy soils, we also want to test a hypothesis that the dominant fungi in paddy soils are Ascomycota, which reportedly prefer habitats with low soil C/N ratios. Using quantitative PCR and barcoded pyrosequencing, we investigated the abundance, diversity, and community composition of fungal communities in 30 surface paddy soil samples collected from 10 rice cultivation regions of China. Pearsons correlation, analysis of variance, partial least squares regression, principal coordinates analysis, and variation partition were performed for analyses of gene copy numbers, alpha-diversity, beta-diversity, and relative abundances of fungal taxa and their relationships with environmental factors. The abundance of fungal 18S rRNA gene varied from 10(6.4) to 10(8.6) copies g(-1) soil, and was positively correlated with soil sand, organic matter, and total nitrogen content, and negatively correlated with soil chloride concentration. Ascomycota comprised 88% of total fungal sequences and increased in relative abundance with increasing soil pH and decreasing mean annual temperature (MAT) and precipitation (MAP). The predominance of Ascomycota in fungal communities is probably due to the low soil C/N ratios (9-15) in the paddy soils studied. The alpha-diversity increased with MAT, MAP, and soil nitrate-N and total nitrogen content but decreased with soil pH, clay content, chloride concentration, and C/N ratio. Variation partition revealed that fungal beta-diversity was mainly driven by geographic distance. In paddy soils which are characterized by intensive rice cropping practices, fungal abundance is mainly influenced by soil properties, fungal alpha-diversity is constrained by both climatic factors and soil properties, while fungal community compositions are mainly structured by geographic distance.",2018,18,10.1007/s11368-018-1924-4

In this context, the study aimed to identify factors affecting the spatial and temporal dynamic of the Mycobacterium, a genus widespread in aquatic ecosystems. Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) density variations were quantified in the water column of freshwater lakes at the regional scale (annual monitoring of 49 lakes in the Paris area) and at the local scale (2-year monthly monitoring in Creteil Lake) by real-time quantitative PCR targeting the atpE gene. At the regional scale, mycobacteria densities in water samples ranged from 6.7 x 10(3) to 1.9 x 10(8) genome units per liter. Density variations were primarily explained by water pH, labile iron, and dispersal processes through the connection of the lakes to a river. In Creteil Lake, no spatial variation of mycobacterial densities was noticed over the 2-year monthly survey, except after large rainfall events. Indeed, storm sewer effluents locally and temporarily increased NTM densities in the water column. The temporal dynamic of the NTM densities in Creteil Lake was associated with suspended solid concentrations. No clear seasonal variation was noticed despite a shift in NTM densities observed over the 2012-2013 winter. Temporal NTM densities fluctuations were well predicted by the neutral community model, suggesting a random balance between loss and gain of mycobacterial taxa within Creteil Lake.

Yet, the processes that drive their assembly remain unclear. The perennial shrubs Caragana spp., which is well known for their role in soil and water conservation, provides an ideal system to study the biogeography of rhizosphere microorganism communities within natural ecosystems. In order to detect how bacterial rhizosphere communities vary in terms of community diversity and composition, the rhizosphere bacterial community of three Caragana species, Caragana microphylla Lam., C. liouana Zhao, and C. korshinskii Kom., which distributed in arid and semi-arid region of northern China were investigated. Across species, Proteobacteria (61.1%), Actinobacteria (16.0%), Firmicutes (8.6%), Bacteroidetes (3.0%), Acidobacteria (3.5%), Gemmatimonadetes (1.4%), and Cyanobacteria (1.0%) were the most dominant phyla in the rhizosphere of the three Caragana species. The relative abundance of Cyanobacteria was significantly higher in rhizosphere of C. korshinskii Kom. compared with C. microphylla Lam. and C. liouana Zhao, while the opposite was found for Gemmatimonadetes in rhizosphere of C. microphylla Lam. relative to C. liouana Zhao. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis showed that both diversity and richness of the bacterial rhizosphere communities significantly and positively correlated with soil pH (p < 0.01). Distance-based redundancy analysis indicated that soil properties and non-soil parameters detected there accounted for 47.5% of bacterial phylogenetic structure variation (p < 0.01) all together.

We examined methodological variations in sample processing using a defined, mock BE microbial community to better understand the scope of technique-based vs. biological-based differences in both ribosomal transcript (rRNA) and gene (DNA) sequence community analysis. Based on in vitro tests, a protocol was adopted for the analysis of the genetic and metabolic pool (DNA vs. rRNA) of air and surface microbiomes within a residential setting. Results: We observed differences in DNA/RNA co-extraction efficiency for individual microbes, but overall, a greater recovery of rRNA using FastPrep (> 50%). Samples stored with various preservation methods at -80 degrees C experienced a rapid decline in nucleic acid recovery starting within the first week, although post-extraction rRNA had no significant degradation when treated with RNAStable. We recommend that co-extraction samples be processed as quickly as possible after collection. The in vivo analysis revealed significant differences in the two components (genetic and metabolic pool) in terms of taxonomy, community structure, and microbial association networks. Rare taxa present in the genetic pool showed higher metabolic potential (RNA: DNA ratio), whereas commonly detected taxa of outdoor origins based on DNA sequencing, especially taxa of the Sphingomonadales order, were present in lower relative abundances in the viable community. Conclusions: Although methodological variations in sample preparations are high, large differences between the DNA and RNA fractions of the total microbial community demonstrate that direct examination of rRNA isolated from a residential BE microbiome has the potential to identify the more likely viable or active portion of the microbial community. In an environment that has primarily dead and metabolically inactive cells, we suggest that the rRNA fraction of BE samples is capable of providing a more ecologically relevant insight into the factors that drive indoor microbial community dynamics.",2018,6,10.1186/s40168-018-0453-0

However, it remains elusive on how gut microbiota impacts overall growth and more specifically, adipogenesis. Using the pig as an animal model, we compared the differences in bacterial community structure throughout the intestinal tract in two breeds (Landrace and Jinhua) of pigs with distinct phenotypes. The Landrace is a commercial purebred and the Jinhua is a Chinese indigenous, slow-growing breed with high propensity for fat deposition. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we revealed that the bacterial communities are more diverse in the duodenum, jejunum, and cecum of Jinhua pigs than in those of Landrace pigs, whereas the ileal and colonic microbiota show a similar complexity between the two breeds. Furthermore, a number of bacterial taxa differentially exist in Jinhua and Landrace pigs throughout the entire intestinal tract, with the jejunal and ileal microbiome showing the greatest contrast. Functional prediction of the bacterial community suggested increased fatty acid biosynthesis in Jinghua pigs, which could partially explain their adiposity phenotype. Further studies are warranted to experimentally verify the relative contribution of each enriched bacterial species and their effect on adipogenesis and animal growth.",2018,8,10.1038/s41598-018-24289-z

Here we evaluate the hypothesis that hadal trenches contain unique microbial biodiversity through analyses of the communities present in the bottom waters of the Kermadec and Mariana trenches. Estimates of microbial protein production indicate active populations under in situ hydrostatic pressures and increasing adaptation to pressure with depth. Depth, trench of collection, and size fraction are important drivers of microbial community structure. Many putative hadal bathytypes, such as members related to the Marinimicrobia, Rhodobacteraceae, Rhodospirilliceae, and Aquibacter, are similar to members identified in other trenches. Most of the differences between the two trench microbiomes consists of taxa belonging to the Gammaproteobacteria whose distributions extend throughout the water column. Growth and survival estimates of representative isolates of these taxa under deep-sea conditions suggest that some members may descend from shallower depths and exist as a potentially inactive fraction of the hadal zone. We conclude that the distinct pelagic communities residing in these two trenches, and perhaps by extension other trenches, reflect both cosmopolitan hadal bathytypes and ubiquitous genera found throughout the water column.",2018,13,10.1371/journal.pone.0195102

Leptospirosis is a widespread zoonotic bacterial infection caused by pathogenic species of the genus Leptospira. Despite a wide range of animal hosts, information is still lacking on the factors shaping Leptospira diversity in wild animal communities, especially in regions, such as tropical insular ecosystems, with high host species richness and complex biogeographical patterns. Using a large dataset (34 mammal species) and a multilocus approach at a regional scale, we analyzed the role of both host species diversity and geography in Leptospira genetic diversity in terrestrial small mammals (rodents, tenrecs, and shrews) and bats from 10 different islands/countries in the western Indian Ocean (WIO) and neighboring Africa. At least four Leptospira spp. (L. interrogans, L. borgpetersenii, L. kirschneri, and L. mayottensis) and several yet-unidentified genetic clades contributed to a remarkable regional Leptospira diversity, which was generally related to the local occurrence of the host species rather than the geography. In addition, the genetic structure patterns varied between Leptospira spp., suggesting different evolutionary histories in the region, which might reflect both in situ diversification of native mammals (for L. borgpetersenii) and the more recent introduction of non-native host species (for L. interrogans). Our data also suggested that host shifts occurred between bats and rodents, but further investigations are needed to determine how host ecology may influence these events.",2018,7,10.1038/s41426-018-0059-4

In the Northeast (NE) Pacific Ocean recent studies have found an abundance of seeps at varying spatial separations and within distinct biogeochemical environments ranging in oxygen, depth, and temperature. Here, we examine eight newly discovered seeps and two known seeps covering 800 km and varying across 2000 m water depth to identify: (1) novel megafaunal communities in this geographical region; (2) variations in the microbiome of seep habitats across the margin; (3) spatial and biogeochemical drivers of microbial diversity at seeps. In addition to authigenic carbonates, clam beds, microbial mats, and exposed hydrates - we also observed Siboglinidae tube worm bushes and an anomalous deep-sea barnacle adding to the overall habitats known from the NE Pacific. The microbial communities showed high variability in their spatial distribution and community structure. The seep communities formed distinct groups that included multiple groups of anaerobic methane oxidizing Archaea (ANME; 1, 2ab, 2c, and 3), often co-occurring within one site - however, there were also other sites with clearly dominant members (e.g. ANME-1s at Nehalem Bank). Sulfide oxidizers were dominated by the non-mat forming Campylobacterales and even though vertical gradients in redox potential typify seep sediments, in two cases there was not a significant change in community structure across the top five cm of sediment. We posit that these patterns were driven by bubble-turbation, and bioirrigation by megafauna. A surprising latitudinal trend was observed in species diversity and richness with increasing richness significantly correlated to increasing latitude. Overall, our results demonstrate that heterogeneity is ubiquitous in the seep biome, spanning all faunal classes, and that the understanding of seeps and the drivers of the community structure can be improved by studying seeps at a range of spatial scales.",2018,150,10.1016/j.dsr2.2017.10.016

To reveal the changes of diversity and community structure of protists along the salinity gradients, community compositions of active protistan assemblages were characterized along a transect from the lower Pearl River estuary to the open waters of the South China Sea (SCS), using high-throughput sequencing of the hyper-variable V9 regions of 18S rRNA. This study showed that the alpha diversity of protists, both in the freshwater and in the coastal SCS stations was higher than that in the estuary. The protist community structure also changed along the salinity gradient. The relative sequence abundance of Stramenopiles was highest at stations with lower salinity and decreased with the increasing of salinity. By contrast, the contributions of Alveolata, Hacrobia and Rhizaria to the protistan communities generally increased with the increasing of salinity. The composition of the active protistan community was strongly correlated with salinity, indicating that salinity was the dominant factor among measured environmental parameters affecting protistan community composition and structure.

Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of bacterial communities using six different successional soil datasets distributed across different regions. Different relationships between pH and successional age across these datasets allowed us to separate the influences of successional age (i.e., time) from soil pH. We found that extreme acidic or alkaline pH conditions lead to assembly of phylogenetically more clustered bacterial communities through deterministic processes, whereas pH conditions close to neutral lead to phylogenetically less clustered bacterial communities with more stochasticity. We suggest that the influence of pH, rather than successional age, is the main driving force in producing trends in phylogenetic assembly of bacteria, and that pH also influences the relative balance of stochastic and deterministic processes along successional soils. Given that pH had a much stronger association with community assembly than did successional age, we evaluated whether the inferred influence of pH was maintained when studying globally distributed samples collected without regard for successional age. This dataset confirmed the strong influence of pH, suggesting that the influence of soil pH on community assembly processes occurs globally. Extreme pH conditions likely exert more stringent limits on survival and fitness, imposing strong selective pressures through ecological and evolutionary time. Taken together, these findings suggest that the degree to which stochastic vs. deterministic processes shape soil bacterial community assembly is a consequence of soil pH rather than successional age.",2018,12,10.1038/s41396-018-0082-4

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) screening showed that anammox were not widespread, and were only detected in 9 sampling sites of the 50 sites tested by amplifying the 16S rRNA genes. Then, only samples collected from Linzhi (2,715 m), Rikaze (4,030 m), and Naqu (5,011 m), which were positive for the presence of anammox, were further processed to explore the biogeography of anammox bacteria in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Results of high-throughput sequencing targeting the hydrazine synthesis -subunit (hzsB) gene revealed the presence of three known anammox genera (Candidatus Brocadia, Candidatus Jettenia, and Candidatus Kuenenia) in both soil types. Their diversity, community composition, and abundance did not show significant variation with altitude at large scale. However, it was the small-scale environmental heterogeneities between wetland and dryland soils that determined their biogeographical distribution. Specifically, the dryland soils had higher diversity of anammox bacteria than the wetland soils, but their abundance patterns varied. The community composition of anammox bacteria were found to be influenced by soil nitrate content.",2018,7,10.1002/mbo3.556

In many European countries, commercial cultivation of Bt maize is not allowed. One major reason is the potential variation of the environmental risk across different biogeographical regions. The aim of this study was to collect data about soil nematode communities as bioindicators of unintended effects across geographically diverse maize growing regions in Europe by sampling field sites in Denmark, Slovakia, and Sweden during 2013-2014, and in Spain during 2013. DKC3872YG (Bt maize line MON810) and its near-isogenic line DKC3871 were grown at the sites in Slovakia, Denmark, and Sweden and hybrids DKC6451YG (Bt maize line MON810) and its near-isogenic line DKC6450 were cultivated at the site in Spain. Dominating nematode genera in the maize fields regardless of the field site or maize variants were bacterial feeders Rhabditis, Acrobeloides; root-fungal feeders Filenchus; fungal feeders Aphelenchoides, Aphelenchus; and omnivores Eudorylaimus. A significant effect of the field site location on the total nematode abundance, nematode abundance in trophic groups, diversity of nematode genera, and ecological and functional nematode indices was detected. Significant annual variation was found in the Plant parasite and Structure indices. There were significant differences in the abundances of omnivores and root-fungal feeders and in the Maturity, Channel, and Enrichment indices between Bt and non-Bt maize plots in Denmark in 2013, and in the abundance of fungal feeders in Sweden (2013). On the other hand, no difference was found between the Bt and non-Bt plots at the sites in Spain and Slovakia or at any of the sites in 2014. The effect of the field site location and season on the soil nematode community was more pronounced than that of the Bt genetic modification.

Most previous work has relied on studying bacteria and viruses independently, thereby reducing them to two separate communities. Such approaches are unable to capture how these microbial communities interact, such as through processes that maintain community robustness or allow phage-host populations to co-evolve. We implemented a network-based analytical approach to describe phage-bacteria network diversity throughout the human body. We built these community networks using a machine learning algorithm to predict which phages could infect which bacteria in a given microbiome. Our algorithm was applied to paired viral and bacterial metagenomic sequence sets from three previously published human cohorts. We organized the predicted interactions into networks that allowed us to evaluate phage-bacteria connectedness across the human body. We observed evidence that gut and skin network structures were person-specific and not conserved among cohabitating family members. High-fat diets appeared to be associated with less connected networks. Network structure differed between skin sites, with those exposed to the external environment being less connected and likely more susceptible to network degradation by microbial extinction events. This study quantified and contrasted the diversity of virome-microbiome networks across the human body and illustrated how environmental factors may influence phage-bacteria interactive dynamics. This work provides a baseline for future studies to better understand system perturbations, such as disease states, through ecological networks.",2018,14,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006099

It has been hypothesized that the magnitude of the mass extinction delayed the subsequent recovery, and so to test this, we undertook the highest resolution study to date of the post-extinction (Griesbachian) microbialite unit on the Great Bank of Guizhou, south China. The benthic community from the microbialite unit is taxonomically diverse when compared to other coeval deposits, recording both inarticulate and articulate brachiopods, crinoids, echinoids, bivalves, gastropods, microconchids, and ostracods. Here we recognize 49 taxa from 4,557 individuals, which raise the known diversity of the Great Bank of Guizhou basal microbialite unit to 84 invertebrate species, making it the most diverse Early Triassic community currently reported. About 89% of the genera are Permian holdovers, whilst only 13% of the species are Permian holdovers. These new data record no temporal trends in the species richness, Simpson diversity, Simpson effective diversity, taxonomic distinctness, functional diversity, or body size of the benthos during the post-extinction microbialite unit. Nevertheless, the small body sizes of the benthic community, prevalence of opportunistic taxa (e.g., Claraia), and the large lophophoral cavity in the lingulid brachiopod, Sinolingularia huananensis, suggests that these animals lived in a highly stressed environment. We propose that the microbialite unit contains a survival fauna in an interval that represents persistent environmental stress from the latest Permian mass extinction event, associated with deoxygenation, high temperatures, elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide levels (pCO(2)), and elevated primary productivity.",2018,33,10.1002/2018PA003328

Recent work has shown that bacterial communities associated with individual macroalgae possess on a local scale a functional core that is likely derived from diverse members of functional guilds. It is not known whether such functional cores also exist across large spatial scales or between closely related host species. To address this, we studied here the bacterial communities on three species of the green macroalgal genus Ulva from different geographic locations. While the taxonomic composition was too variable to describe a community core, we identified genes that were enriched across all Ulva samples as compared to the communities of the surrounding seawater. Of these core functions, 70% were consistently found and independent of the Ulva species and biogeography, while the remaining functions (similar to 30%) are possibly involved in local or host-specific adaptations. For each host individual, the core functions are provided by bacteria with distinct phylogenetic origin and these bacteria could constitute a global guild of Ulva-associated bacteria. Together, our results demonstrate the presence of a stable core set of functional genes in the bacterial communities associated with closely related host species and across large biogeographies.",2018,27,10.1111/mec.14529

In total, 149,519 optimized sequences were obtained. Bacterial Shannon index increased along elevation from 699 m to 937 m and started to decrease at the elevation of 1,044 m, showing a humpback curve along elevation. Evenness (ACE index) and richness (Chao index) of the soil bacterial community both decreased with elevation (the highest values of 770 and 762 at 699 m and the lowest values of 548 and 539 at 1,177 m, respectively), all the indices are significantly different between elevations. Bacterial composition at phylum and genus levels had some differences between elevations, but the dominant bacterial populations were generally consistent. Beta-diversity analysis showed a distance-decay pattern of bacterial community similarity at different samples. Soil physical and chemical properties explained 70.78% of the variation in bacterial community structure (soil pH explained 19.95%), and elevational distance only explained 8.42%.

"Delhey, K",Darker where cold and wet: Australian birds follow their own version of Glogers rule,ECOGRAPHY,"Glogers rule is usually interpreted as predicting darker coloured animals in warmer and more humid/vegetated regions. The relative importance of temperature and rainfall or vegetation is however unclear, and often only one variable is tested at a time, mainly through proxies. Here, I assess the predictions of Glogers rule for interspecific achromatic plumage variation (dark to light variation) for an entire avifauna (551 species of Australian landbirds). I tested the effects of climatic variables (temperature and rainfall) and vegetation structure on plumage reflectance at species and assemblage level (100 x 100 km cells), controlling for phylogenetic relatedness and spatial autocorrelation. To assess the robustness of these results I compared observed results with those of a null distribution of effects obtained from repeatedly simulating random plumage reflectance evolution on the phylogeny. At both the species and assemblage level, darker coloured birds were found in wetter and colder regions and in more densely vegetated habitats. Simulations confirm results at the species level and the effect of temperature at the assemblage level, but rainfall and vegetation effects at the assemblage level fall within the distribution of simulated effects and should be interpreted with care. Interspecific colour variation in Australian birds supports Glogers rule for rainfall/vegetation, but shows the opposite pattern for temperature. Darker colours in wet and vegetated environments are consistent with the role of melanin pigmentation in preventing feather degradation by bacteria, but also with background-matching for camouflage. Darker plumage might be beneficial in colder regions or detrimental in warmer regions if it affects thermoregulation, a selective force often only assumed to be of importance for ectotherms. The data highlight the need to test the generality of biogeographic rules across levels and at broad scale. Experimental work is needed to confirm the mechanisms linking plumage achromatic variation to climate.",2018,41,10.1111/ecog.03040

Low genetic variation was found in all loci, both between and within Antarctic and southern South American populations, suggesting a relatively recent (likely within the last million years) colonization of this moss to the Antarctic, as well as a likely severe bottleneck during Pleistocene glaciations in southern South America. We also performed a simple atmospheric transfer modeling approach to study potential colonization rates of small (microscopic/microbial) or spore-dispersed organisms (such as many mosses and lichens). These suggested that the northern Antarctic Peninsula shows potentially regular connectivity from southern South America, with air masses transferring, particularly southbound, between the two regions.

We examined bacterioplankton metacommunities using 16S rRNA amplicons from the Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ) in the eastern Pacific Ocean and in global ocean transect samples to determine sensitivity of these assemblages to environmental perturbations. Habitat filtering was the main assembly mechanism of bacterioplankton community composition in the epi- and mesopelagic waters of the CCZ and the Tara Oceans transect. Bathy- and abyssopelagic bacterioplankton assemblages were mainly assembled by undetermined metacommunity types or neutral and dispersal-driven patch-dynamics for the CCZ and the Malaspina transect.

The mycobiomes of different tissue types were assessed with high-throughput amplicon sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer DNA region. Both plants hosted different fungal communities and varied in alpha- and beta-diversity, despite their neighboring occurrence. However, the fungal assemblages of Amorphophallus leaflets shared taxa with the mycobiomes of tea leaves, thereby suggesting common driving forces for leaf-inhabiting fungi irrespective of host plant identity. The mycobiome composition and diversity of tea leaves was clearly driven by leaf age. We suggest that the very youngest tea leaves are colonized by stochastic processes, while mycobiomes of old leaves are rather similar as the result of progressive succession. The biodiversity of fungi associated with A. albispathus was characterized by a large number of unclassified OTUs (at genus and species level) and by tissue-specific composition.This study is the first cultivation-independent high-throughput assessment of fungal biodiversity of an Amorphophallus species, and additionally expands the knowledge base on fungi associated with tea plants.",2018,17,10.1007/s11557-018-1375-8

We analysed metacommunity structure and functional trait variation in 148 communities of desmids, freshwater green algae, distributed throughout Europe. We delineated biogeographic modules for both taxa and sites using bipartite network analysis given that the taxa of a module co-occurred more often than expected by chance in sites of the same module. The network analysis distinguished two main acidic and neutral habitats, reflecting environmental filtering, and within each habitat separated species pools with distinct geographic locations, representing a plausible influence of historical biogeography. The geographic differentiation was consistent with a hypothesis of glacial refugia on Atlantic coast. Distance decay in community composition in addition to environmental influence further suggested a role of dispersal limitation. Next, we quantified the variation in cell volume and surface-to-volume of taxa within and among communities, to examine morphological and physiological adaptations of desmids in varying environments. Communities from continental climate contained larger desmids. Conversely, we found a functional convergence of smaller, fast-growing, desmids in oceanic regions. Overall, our findings suggest that niche-based processes, dispersal limitation, and historical legacy together drive the distribution and structure of desmid communities. Combining trait- and network-based analyses can resolve long-lasting questions in microbial ecology and biogeography, and could be successfully used in macrobial ecology too.",2018,186,10.1007/s00442-018-4074-x

Using next generation sequencing of 0.2 mu m-1 mu m filtered water column samples, we detected abundant and diverse fungal sequences across 25 stream and river sites in the Ozark region of Oklahoma and Arkansas. Fungal communities were only weakly related to stream environmental metrics with the exception of total phosphorus (TP). We infer from our results that TP is acting as a proxy for unique catchment effects. We observed patterns of dominant community taxa at higher taxonomic groupings but lower taxonomic groupings were site specific. OTU functional assignment showed the majority of sequences to be related to plant and animal pathogens, and some saprotrophs. The likely allochthonous origin and strong site specificity of these fungi suggest overlooked dispersal via lotic waterways, which may have important biogeographic consequences for fungi.

Using sets of sequences encoding the M sub-unit of the photosynthetic apparatus from different oceanic regions, we prioritized the processes underlying AAP bacterial biogeographical patterns. The present analysis offers novel insights into the ecological distribution of marine AAP bacteria and highlights that physiological constraints play a key role in structuring AAP bacterial assemblages at a global scale. Salinity especially seems to favor lineage-specific adaptations. Moreover, by inferring the evolutionary history of habitat transitions, a substantial congruence between habitat and evolutionary relatedness was highlighted.

Here, we explore the evolutionary dynamics of secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (SMGCs) following lineage divergence of these sister-taxa. These sister-taxa strains contained 310 distinct SMGCs belonging to 22 different gene cluster classes. While there was broad conservation of these 22 gene cluster classes among the genomes analyzed, each individual genome harbored a different number of gene clusters within each class. A total of nine SMGCs were conserved across nearly all strains, but the majority (57%) of SMGCs were strain-specific. We show that while each individual genome has a unique combination of SMGCs, this diversity displays lineage-level modularity. Overall, the northern-derived (NDR) clade had more SMGCs than the southern-derived (SDR) clade (40.7 � 3.9 and 33.8 � 3.9, mean and S.D., respectively). This difference in SMGC content corresponded with differences in the number of predicted open reading frames (ORFs) per genome (7775 � 196 and 7093 � 205, mean and S.D., respectively) such that the ratio of SMGC:ORF did not differ between sister-taxa genomes. We show that changes in SMGC diversity between the sister-taxa were driven primarily by gene acquisition and deletion events, and these changes were associated with an overall change in genome size which accompanied lineage divergence.",2018,7,10.3390/antibiotics7010012

Several biotic and abiotic factors affect the biogeographical distributions of soil microbial biomass (MB) and communities on geographical scales; however, the extent to which soil microbial communities are influenced by these factors is not yet clear. We examined and compared the biomass and structure of soil microbial communities within and between nine mature undisturbed forest ecosystems along the 3700-km North-South Transect in Eastern China (NSTEC). The results showed that soil MB and phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) increased with latitude. The structure of the microbial community in boreal forest soils was comparable with that in temperate forests but was significantly different from the microbial communities in warm temperate, subtropical and tropical forests. The mean annual temperature, soil organic carbon, soil total nitrogen and soil easily soluble phosphorus were the main predictors of latitudinal variance in the soil microbial communities. Soils within the same climatic types had similar properties, and soil MB and PLFAs seemed to change along gradients in the various forest types along the NSTEC. Microbial communities showed spatial variation and were dependent on soil properties and climate but were relatively independent of plant functional traits and litter quality. The results suggested that soil microbes could improve the ecosystem models so that they simulate the microbial mechanisms of carbon (C) and nutrient cycling.",2018,124,10.1016/j.apsoil.2017.11.019

Around the vent, the fauna is distributed accordingly, showing characteristic niche partitioning for different groups of animals. In this study we investigate shell microstructure, minor elements and stable isotope compositions of two groups of organisms such as a snail, Ifremeria nautilei, and a crustacean, Eochionelasmus ohtai manusensis. Both organisms occupy distinct niches within the same hydrothermal vent field of the Manus Basin, Western Pacific. Powder XRD and electron microbeam analysis of a polished cross-section indicate that the shells are composed of microcrystalline calcite, with distinct Na, Mg, Sr, and S element contents. For both specimens 20-30 mu m large weddellite crystals were found. The delta O-18 profiles were obtained perpendicular to the growth increments of L nautilei and E. o. manusensis calcitic shells. Those profiles reveal isotopic variations of 0.5 and 0.6 parts per thousand, respectively for both intra- and inter-shell measurements. For E.o. manusensis, the Mg content suggests continuous shell growth during the year, both delta O-18 and Mg data supporting cyclical variation of temperature at vent site. The calculated temperatures at sites with L nautilei and E.o. manusensis range from 17 degrees to 21.5 degrees C and from 2.1 degrees to 7.2 degrees C, respectively, showing a similar variability of 5-6 degrees C. The delta C-13 values of the Ifremeria calcitic shell range from 3 parts per thousand to 4.6 parts per thousand (V-PDB), the isotopic composition being C-13-enriched relative to the surrounding inorganic pool.

However, still very little is known about the identity, metabolic properties and distribution of the microbial group proposed to be responsible for most of this uptake, the uncultivated upland soil cluster (USC). Here, we reconstructed a draft genome of USC from a combination of targeted cell sorting and metagenomes from forest soil, providing the first insights into its metabolic potential and environmental adaptation strategies. The 16S rRNA gene sequence recovered was distinctive and suggests this crucial group as a new genus within the Beijerinckiaceae, close to Methylocapsa. Application of a fluorescently labelled suicide substrate for the particulate methane monooxygenase enzyme (pMMO) coupled to 16S rRNA fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) allowed for the first time a direct link of the high-affinity activity of methane oxidation to USC cells in situ. Analysis of the global biogeography of this group further revealed its presence in previously unrecognized habitats, such as subterranean and volcanic biofilm environments, indicating a potential role of these environments in the biological sink for atmospheric methane.",2018,20,10.1111/1462-2920.14036

As inactive endospores that cannot grow at the low ambient temperatures, they are akin to tracer particles in cold sediments, unaffected by factors normally governing microbial biogeography (e.g., selection, drift, mutation). This makes thermophilic endospores ideal model organisms for studying microbial biogeography since their spatial distribution can be directly related to their dispersal history. To assess dispersal histories of estuarine bacteria, thermophilic endospores were enriched from sediments along a freshwater-to-marine transect of the River Tyne in high temperature incubations (50 degrees C). Dispersal histories for 75 different taxa indicated that the majority of estuarine endospores were of terrestrial origin; most closely related to bacteria from warm habitats associated with industrial activity. A subset of the taxa detected were marine derived, with close relatives from hot deep marine biosphere habitats. These patterns are consistent with the sources of sediment in the River Tyne being predominantly terrestrial in origin. The results point to microbial communities in estuarine and marine sediments being structured by bi-directional currents, terrestrial run-off and industrial effluent as vectors of passive dispersal and immigration.",2018,20,10.1111/1462-2920.14056

Here, we implemented a transplant experiment where bacterioplankton from three regions of the Baltic Sea with differing salinities (approximate to 3, 7 and 28 psu) were exposed to each others environmental conditions. We found that habitat specialists were more abundant than generalists after exposure to salinity changes, irrespective of their origins. Most specialists that were selected following a salinity change were rare in the starting communities. Selection for generalists, however, was not specifically driven by the recruitment of either rare or abundant members, suggesting that taxons initial abundance is minor relevant to the growth of generalists. Patterns in phylogenetic relatedness indicated that environmental filtering was the most influential assembly mechanism for specialists, whereas competitive interaction was more important for the assembly of generalists. Altogether, this study shows that large salinity changes promote the establishment of habitat specialists and that deterministic processes vary during community assembly for ecologically dissimilar taxa. We, therefore, propose that distinguishing assembly mechanisms of different community members helps understand and predict community dynamics in response to environmental change.",2018,20,10.1111/1462-2920.14059

Long-term disturbances offer opportunities to examine microbiome responses at scales relevant for both ecological and evolutionary processes and can be insightful for studying ARGs. We examined ARGs in soils overlying the underground coal seam fire in Centralia, PA, which has been burning since 1962. As the fire progresses, previously hot soils can recover to ambient temperatures, which creates a gradient of fire impact. We examined metagenomes from surface soils along this gradient to examine ARGs using a gene-targeted assembler. We targeted 35 clinically relevant ARGs and two horizontal gene transfer-related genes (intI and repA). We detected 17 ARGs in Centralia: AAC6-Ia, adeB, bla_A, bla_B, bla_C, cmlA, dfra12, intI, sul2, tetA, tetW, tetX, tolC, vanA, vanH, vanX and vanZ. The diversity and abundance of bla_A, bla_B, dfra12 and tolC decreased with soil temperature, and changes in ARGs were largely explained by changes in community structure. We observed sequence-specific biogeography along the temperature gradient and observed compositional shifts in bla A, dfra12 and intI. These results suggest that increased temperatures can reduce soil ARGs but that this is largely due to a concomitant reduction in community-level diversity.",2018,94,10.1093/femsec/fiy016

We term this approach genohydrology, and show that OTU relative abundances can be used to predict river discharge at monthly and longer timescales. Based on a single DNA sample from each river, the average Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) for predicted mean monthly discharge values throughout the year was 0.84, while the NSE for predicted discharge values across different return intervals was 0.67. These are considerable improvements over predictions based only on the area-scaled mean specific discharge of five similar rivers, which had average NSE values of 0.64 and -0.32 for seasonal and recurrence interval discharge values, respectively.

It is increasingly clear that some larger microorganisms have restricted distributions and plausible to imagine that many human activities could lead to exotic species introductions, but concrete examples are lacking. We investigated an unusual case study: the former mining settlement of Pyramiden on the island of Spitsbergen in the Svalbard archipelago. In around 1983 large quantities of chernozem soils were imported from the southern USSR as part of an urban greening initiative, bringing large numbers of soil organisms to a very different physical environment. Focusing on a readily-identifiable group of protists with documented regional endemism (testate amoebae), we assessed morphospecies assemblages after thirty years. We analysed communities from Pyramiden imported soils and conducted comparisons to: i) nearby locations with non-imported near-natural soils; ii) previously-established datasets from near-natural Svalbard soils and chernozem soils in southern Russia, and iii) regional species inventories from both regions. Our aims were to assess how the community has adapted to the change in physical conditions and identify any evidence for the import of exotic taxa. Our results show significant differences between the assemblages of imported soils and those of nearby reference sites but strict comparisons are complicated by the different treatment of soils in different locations. No taxa were identified which can be unambiguously identified as atypical for the region. Assemblages of imported soils were more similar to those of other sites on Svalbard than to assemblages from southern Russia. Our data are equivocal but suggest that the testate amoeba assemblages of soils transported more than 3000 km northwards have substantially acclimated to the new conditions, contrasting with micro-invertebrates in the same site.

Here, we investigated the influence of several well-known ecological principles on animal-associated microbiota by characterizing gut microbial specimens from bilaterally symmetrical animals (Bilateria) ranging from flies to whales. A rigorously vetted sample set containing 265 specimens from 64 species was assembled. Bacterial lineages were characterized by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Previously published samples were also compared, allowing analysis of over 1,098 samples in total. A restricted number of bacterial phyla was found to account for the great majority of gut colonists. Gut microbial composition was associated with host phylogeny and diet. We identified numerous gut bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences that diverged deeply from previously studied taxa,identifying opportunities to discover new bacterial types. The number of bacterial lineages per gut sample was positively associated with animal mass, paralleling known species-area relationships from island biogeography and implicating body size as a determinant of community stability and niche complexity. Samples from larger animals harbored greater numbers of anaerobic communities, specifying a mechanism for generating more-complex microbial environments. Predictions for species/abundance relationships from models of neutral colonization did not match the data set, pointing to alternative mechanisms such as selection of specific colonists by environmental niche. Taken together, the data suggest that niche complexity increases with gut size and that niche selection forces dominate gut community construction. IMPORTANCE The intestinal microbiome of animals is essential for health, contributing to digestion of foods, proper immune development, inhibition of pathogen colonization, and catabolism of xenobiotic compounds. How these communities assemble and persist is just beginning to be investigated. Here we interrogated a set of gut samples from a wide range of animals to investigate the roles of selection and random processes in microbial community construction. We show that the numbers of bacterial species increased with the weight of host organisms, paralleling findings from studies of island biogeography. Communities in larger organisms tended to be more anaerobic, suggesting one mechanism for niche diversification. Nonselective processes enable specific predictions for community structure, but our samples did not match the predictions of the neutral model. Thus, these findings highlight the importance of niche selection in community construction and suggest mechanisms of niche diversification.",2018,9,10.1128/mBio.00319-18

The fine-tuned identification of approximately 1000 OPUs (almost equivalent to species) using multivariate analysis revealed regionally distinct taxa compositions. This segregation was more diffuse at the genus level and pointed to a phylogenetic and metabolic redundancy at the higher taxa level, where their different species acquired distinct advantages related to the regional physicochemical idiosyncrasies. The presence of previously undescribed groups was also shown in these environments, such as Parcubacteria, or members of Nanohaloarchaeota in anaerobic hypersaline sediments.

A total of 328 taxa, including morphotypes, were identified from 2091 specimens. The fluorescence patterns under an epifluorescence microscope were mainly classified into five groups: 1) R & D; 2) R-G; 3) Y-B; 4) Periph-R; and 5) Pale-R. There were 37 species/morphotypes with the R&D pattern in the orders Collodaria, Entactinaria, Nassellaria, and Spumellaria. The R-G and Y-B patterns were confirmed in only four species (Dictyocoryne profunda, D. truncata, Spongaster tetras tetras, S. tetras irregularis) of our identified 328 taxa, suggesting a strong species-specific effect on the presence of PE-containing Synechococcus-type cyanobacteria. In the Periph-R pattern, red fluorescence is emitted from the peripheral part inside flat spumellarians, suggesting that the source of this pale red fluorescence is photosynthetic organisms digested by radiolarians. In particular, taxa with the R&D pattern can be classified into three groups: 1) obligate associations; 2) facultative associations; and 3) non-associations. Many taxa belonging to Acanthodesmiidae and Lophospyris have a great number of symbiotic dinoflagellates outside the central capsule. However, the Acanthodesmiidae includes non-photosynthetic holobionts (Amphispyris and Ceratobotrys borealis), suggesting different environmental adaptability in some acanthodesmiid species. In contrast with the obligate symbiosis tendency in Acanthodesmiidae, the Lophophaenidae tends to have non-photosynthetic holobionts. In Spumellaria, one significant tendency was recognized in Tetrapyle and Phorticium as obligate dinoflagellate holobionts. Thus, Tetrapyle and Phorticium are useful for tracing oceanographic conditions in the euphotic zone. Dictyocoryne truncata and D. profunda are classified into the R-G pattern, whereas D. muelleri was grouped into the R&D pattern, indicating that the difference in the photosynthetic association may be closely related to the dwelling depth. The Q-mode cluster analysis showed that the 30 stations were classified into four clusters: A1, A2, B, and C. The geographical distributions of the four cluster groups are consistent with the climate zone and water masses, suggesting that the species composition of these shallow taxa is influenced by the distribution of water masses. In particular, the Kuroshio Current may play an important role in the migration of shallow living radiolarian species from the subtropical climatic zone to the subarctic climatic zone.",2018,139,10.1016/j.marmicro.2017.10.007

We used P. biaurelia (one of the 15 cryptic species of the P. aurelia complex) collected worldwide from 92 sampling points over 62 years and analyzed with the three above mentioned approaches as a model for testing protistan biogeography hypotheses. Our results indicated that despite the large distance between them, most of the studied populations of P. biaurelia do not differ from each other (rDNA fragment), or differ only slightly (COI mtDNA fragment). These results could suggest that in the past, the predecessors of the present P. biaurelia population experienced a bottleneck event, and that its current distribution is the result of recent dispersal by natural or anthropogenic factors. Another possible explanation for the low level of genetic diversity despite the huge distances between the collecting sites could be a slow rate of mutation of the studied DNA fragments, as has been found in some other species of the P. aurelia complex. COI haplotypes determined from samples obtained during field research conducted in 2015-2016 in 28 locations/374 sampling points in southern Poland were shared with other, often distant P. biaurelia populations.

Our results suggest that SAR202 cluster members are medium sized, free-living cells with a heterotrophic lifestyle, broadly divided into two distinct clades. We present the first evidence of vertical stratification of these microbes along the meso- and bathypelagic ocean layers. Remarkably, two distinct species of SAR202 cluster are highly abundant in nearly all deep bathypelagic metagenomic datasets available so far.

In this review, we synthesize the most recent discoveries and achievements made towards understanding the pathogenesis and epidemiology of these two bacterial diseases and present current efforts in finding ways to combat them. Recent Findings Advancements in molecular methods, such as next-generation sequencing, have provided high-resolution insight into the epidemiological parameters and factors of virulence for the foulbroods of honeybees. Summary The recently gained detailed knowledge of the diversity, biogeography, and relatedness of strains and sub-types of the causative bacteria of AFB and EFB provides a background to study their epidemiology at many scales.

"Spiesman, BJ; Stapper, AP; Inouye, BD","Patch size, isolation, and matrix effects on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in a landscape microcosm",ECOSPHERE,"The amount and arrangement of habitat is a fundamental determinant of biodiversity and ecosystem processes in a landscape. Biodiversity is expected to decline following habitat loss and isolation, potentially impeding ecosystem function. But because greater isolation usually accompanies habitat loss, the effects of habitat amount and isolation can be confounded. Moreover, the type or quality of the intervening matrix habitat can mediate amount and isolation effects on biodiversity. We used a landscape microcosm of oak leaf litter patches to examine the responses of bacterial communities and the ecosystem function of oak leaf decomposition to patch size, degree of isolation, and matrix habitat type (pine litter or bare ground). We found that oak patch size had no significant effect on bacterial communities or decomposition rates. However, bacterial richness increased with greater patch isolation and when oak litter patches were surrounded by a matrix of pine litter, rather than bare ground. The benefit of patch isolation for biodiversity runs counter to that expected by island biogeography theory, suggesting that spatially dependent interspecific interactions, such as predation or competition, may override direct dispersal effects. Higher bacterial richness in oak litter patches surrounded by a pine litter matrix indicated that spillover from neighboring matrix habitat can increase local richness. Instead of greater bacterial richness enhancing ecosystem functioning, leaf litter decomposition was negatively correlated with bacterial richness: Decomposition was slower in isolated oak litter patches and patches surrounded by a pine litter matrix. This negative relationship may be a result of spatial dynamics that can promote the persistence of bacteria from pine litter habitats that are not well suited to oak litter decomposition. Overall, our experiment indicates that effects of habitat loss, isolation, and matrix quality on richness and composition may depend on spatially constrained interspecific interactions, which can determine the functional ability of communities.",2018,9,10.1002/ecs2.2173
"Adler, A; Ducker, E",When Pasteurian Science Went to Sea: The Birth of Marine Microbiology,JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF BIOLOGY,"In the late nineteenth century, French naturalists were global leaders in microbial research. Louis Pasteur advanced sterilization techniques and demonstrated that dust particles in the air could contaminate a putrefiable liquid. Pasteurs discoveries prompted a new research program for the naturalists of the Talisman and Travailleur expeditions: to recover uncontaminated water and mud samples from the deep sea. French naturalists Adrien Certes and Paul Regnard both independently conducted experiments to address the question of whether microorganisms inhabited the oceans and whether organic material in the deep sea was subject to decomposition. The experiments of Certes and Regnard have largely been omitted from histories of microbiology and marine science. However, an examination of their work is crucial for understanding the context in which marine microbiology first developed. At the end of the nineteenth century, marine microbiology emerged from the disciplinary melding of terrestrial microbial ecology, experimental physiology, and the then-nascent field of deep-sea biology.",2018,51,10.1007/s10739-017-9477-8

The pristine environmental and geographical relatively isolation of small lakes distributed in the Headwater Region of Yellow River (HRYR) offer a unique opportunity to test the relative roles of these two processes on fungal communities. Here, we investigated the fungal community in sediment samples from 10 lakes located in the HRYR using high-throughput sequencing. The results showed that the fungal community was dominated by Sordariomycetes, Leotiomycetes, Dothideomycetes, Pezizomycetes and Agaricomycetes. The results revealed that altitude, mean annual temperature, C/N ration, dissolve organic carbon and total nitrogen were the best predictors for shaping fungal community structure in these lakes. Significant spatial and environmental distance decay relationships in the fungal community were detected. The partial Mantel test indicated that the fungal community structure was significantly correlated with environmental distance but not with geographic distance. Overall, environmental filtering plays a more important role than dispersal limitation in fungal community structure at a local scale in such an pristine and isolated region.",2018,8,10.1038/s41598-018-21995-6

By contrast, little is known about the composition and diversity of the bacterial community in the sediments (bacteriobenthos) at the freshwater-seawater transition (mesohaline conditions). In this study, partial 16S-rRNA sequences were used to investigate the bacterial community at five stations, representing almost freshwater (oligohaline) to marine conditions, in the Baltic Sea. Samples were obtained from the silty, top-layer (0-2.5 cm) sediments with mostly oxygenated conditions. The long water residence time characteristic of the Baltic Sea, was predicted to enable the development of autochthonous bacteriobenthos at mesohaline conditions. Our results showed that, similar to the water column, salinity is a major factor in structuring the bacteriobenthos and that there is no loss of bacterial richness at intermediate salinities. The bacterial communities of marine, mesohaline, and oligohaline sediments differed in terms of the relative rRNA abundances of the major bacterial phyla/classes. At mesohaline conditions typical marine and oligohaline operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were abundant. Putative unique OTUs in mesohaline sediments were present only at low abundances, suggesting that the mesohaline environment consists mainly of marine and oligohaline bacteria with a broad salinity tolerance. Our study provides a first overview of the diversity patterns and composition of bacteria in the sediments along the Baltic Sea salinity gradient as well as new insights into the bacteriobenthos at mesohaline conditions.",2018,9,10.3389/fmicb.2018.00236

Luminal content and mucosal scraping samples were collected from ten locations in the calf gastrointestinal tract (GIT) over the first 21 days of life, along with postpartum maternal colostrum, udder skin, and vaginal scrapings. Microbiota were found to vary by anatomical location, between the lumen and mucosa at each GIT location, and differentially enriched for maternal vaginal, skin, and colostral microbiota. Most calf sample sites exhibited a gradual increase in alpha-diversity over the 21 days beginning the first few days after birth. The relative abundance of Firmicutes was greater in the proximal GIT, while Bacteroidetes were greater in the distal GIT. Proteobacteria exhibited greater relative abundances in mucosal scrapings relative to luminal content. Forty-six percent of calf luminal microbes and 41% of mucosal microbes were observed in at-least one maternal source, with the majority being shared with microbes on the skin of the udder.

Here, we used spatial and ecological statistics to analyze the role that saliva plays in structuring bacterial communities of the human mouth using > 9000 dental and mucosal samples. We show that regardless of tissue type (teeth, alveolar mucosa, keratinized gingiva, or buccal mucosa), surface-associated bacterial communities vary along an ecological gradient from the front to the back of the mouth, and that on exposed tooth surfaces, the gradient is pronounced on lingual compared to buccal surfaces. Furthermore, our data suggest that this gradient is attenuated in individuals with low salivary flow due to Sjogrens syndrome.

Ammonia-oxidizing microbes play an important role in N cycling in the black soils. However, the information related to the composition and distribution of ammonia-oxidizing microbes in the black soils has not yet been addressed. In this study, we used the amoA gene to quantify the abundance and community composition of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) across the black soil zone. The amoA abundance of AOA was remarkably larger than that of AOB, with ratios of AOA/AOB in the range from 3.1 to 91.0 across all soil samples. The abundance of AOA amoA was positively correlated with total soil C content (p < 0.001) but not with soil pH (p > 0.05). In contrast, the abundance of AOB amoA positively correlated with soil pH (p = 0.009) but not with total soil C. Alpha diversity of AOA did not correlate with any soil parameter, however, alpha diversity of AOB was affected by multiple soil factors, such as soil pH, total P, N, and C, available K content, and soil water content. Canonical correspondence analysis indicated that the AOA community was mainly affected by the sampling latitude, followed by soil pH, total P and C; while the AOB community was mainly determined by soil pH, as well as total P, C and N, water content, and sampling latitude, which highlighted that the AOA community was more geographically distributed in the black soil zone of northeast China than AOB community. In addition, the pairwise analyses showed that the potential nitrification rate (PNR) was not correlated with alpha diversity but weakly positively with the abundance of the AOA community (p = 0.048), whereas PNR significantly correlated positively with the richness (p = 0.003), diversity (p = 0.001) and abundance (p < 0.001) of the AOB community, which suggested that AOB community might make a greater contribution to nitrification than AOA community in the black soils when ammonium is readily available.",2018,9,10.3389/fmicb.2018.00171

It harbors both submarine and intertidal active sites, discharging hydrogen-and methane-rich alkaline fluids of low salinity and mild temperature through porous carbonate edifices. In this study, we have extensively investigated the bacterial and archaeal communities inhabiting the hydrothermal chimneys from one intertidal and three submarine sites by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. We show that the bacterial community of the intertidal site is clearly distinct from that of the submarine sites with species distribution patterns driven by only a few abundant populations, affiliated to the Chloroflexi and Proteobacteria phyla. In contrast, the distribution of archaeal taxa seems less sitedependent, as exemplified by the co-occurrence, in both submarine and intertidal sites, of two dominant phylotypes of Methanosarcinales previously thought to be restricted to serpentinizing systems, either marine (Lost City Hydrothermal Field) or terrestrial (The Cedars ultrabasic springs). Over 70% of the phylotypes were rare and included, among others, all those affiliated to candidate divisions. We finally compared the distribution of bacterial and archaeal phylotypes of Prony Hydrothermal Field with those of five previously studied serpentinizing systems of geographically distant sites. Although sensu stricto no core microbial community was identified, a few uncultivated lineages, notably within the archaeal order Methanosarcinales and the bacterial class Dehalococcoidia (the candidate division MSBL5) were exclusively found in a few serpentinizing systems while other operational taxonomic units belonging to the orders Clostridiales, Thermoanaerobacterales, or the genus Hydrogenophaga, were abundantly distributed in several sites. These lineages may represent taxonomic signatures of serpentinizing ecosystems.

Here, we investigated the influence of spatial scale on the relative role of stochasticity and determinism in agricultural monocultures consisting only of wheat, thereby minimizing the influence of differences in plant species cover and in cultivation/disturbance regime, extending across a wide range of soils and climates of the North China Plain (NCP). We sampled 243 sites across 1092 km and sequenced the 16S rRNA bacterial gene using MiSeq. We hypothesized that determinism would play a relatively stronger role at the broadest scales, due to the strong influence of climate and soil differences in selecting many distinct OTUs of bacteria adapted to the different environments. In order to test the more general applicability of the hypothesis, we also compared with a natural ecosystem on the Tibetan Plateau. Results: Our results revealed that the relative importance of stochasticity vs. determinism did vary with spatial scale, in the direction predicted. On the North China Plain, stochasticity played a dominant role from 150 to 900 km (separation between pairs of sites) and determinism dominated at more than 900 km (broad scale). On the Tibetan Plateau, determinism played a dominant role from 130 to 1200 km and stochasticity dominated at less than 130 km. Among the identifiable deterministic factors, soil pH showed the strongest influence on soil bacterial community structure and diversity across the North China Plain. Together, 23.9% of variation in soil microbial community composition could be explained, with environmental factors accounting for 19.7% and spatial parameters 4.1%. Conclusions: Our findings revealed that (1) stochastic processes are relatively more important on the North China Plain, while deterministic processes are more important on the Tibetan Plateau; (2) soil pH was the major factor in shaping soil bacterial community structure of the North China Plain; and (3) most variation in soil microbial community composition could not be explained with existing environmental and spatial factors. Further studies are needed to dissect the influence of stochastic factors (e.g., mutations or extinctions) on soil microbial community distribution, which might make it easier to predictably manipulate the microbial community to produce better yield and soil sustainability outcomes.",2018,6,10.1186/s40168-018-0409-4
"Besnard, G; Terral, JF; Cornille, A",On the origins and domestication of the olive: a review and perspectives,ANNALS OF BOTANY,"Background Unravelling domestication processes is crucial for understanding how species respond to anthropogenic pressures, forecasting crop responses to future global changes and improving breeding programmes. Domestication processes for clonally propagated perennials differ markedly from those for seed-propagated annual crops, mostly due to long generation times, clonal propagation and recurrent admixture with local forms, leading to a limited number of generations of selection from wild ancestors. However, additional case studies are required to document this process more fully. Scope The olive is an iconic species in Mediterranean cultural history. Its multiple uses and omnipresence in traditional agrosystems have made this species an economic pillar and cornerstone of Mediterranean agriculture. However, major questions about the domestication history of the olive remain unanswered. New paleobotanical, archeological, historical and molecular data have recently accumulated for olive, making it timely to carry out a critical re-evaluation of the biogeography of wild olives and the history of their cultivation. We review here the chronological history of wild olives and discuss the questions that remain unanswered, or even unasked, about their domestication history in the Mediterranean Basin. We argue that more detailed ecological genomics studies of wild and cultivated olives are crucial to improve our understanding of olive domestication. Multidisciplinary research integrating genomics, metagenomics and community ecology will make it possible to decipher the evolutionary ecology of one of the most iconic domesticated fruit trees worldwide. Conclusion The olive is a relevant model for improving our knowledge of domestication processes in clonally propagated perennial crops, particularly those of the Mediterranean Basin. Future studies on the ecological and genomic shifts linked to domestication in olive and its associated community will provide insight into the phenotypic and molecular bases of crop adaptation to human uses.",2018,121,10.1093/aob/mcx145

Thus, as older taxa have produced more individuals over time, and smaller taxa have higher population sizes and faster generation times, the Latitudinal Diversity Gradients (LDGs) of these clades should show shallower slopes. We describe the LDGs for archaea, bacteria, fungi, invertebrates and trees from six North American forests. For three focal groups - bacteria, ants, and trees older taxa had shallower LDG slopes than the more recent, terminal taxa. Across 12 orders of magnitude of body mass, LDG slopes were steeper in larger taxa. The slopes of LDGs vary systematically with body size and clade age, underscoring the non-canonical nature of LDGs. The steepest LDG slopes were found for the largest organisms while the smallest, from bacteria to small litter-soil invertebrates, have shallower-to zero-slope LDGs. If tropical niche conservatism is the failure of clades to adapt to, and diversify in temperate habitats, then the steep LDGs of chordates and plants likely arise from the decreased ability of clades with large individuals to adapt to the multiple challenges of extra-tropical life.",2018,41,10.1111/ecog.02314

To address this deficit, we collected eight samples to unveil the bacterial and archaeal community in the Kaidu river, located at the arid region of northwestern China (an average of 2,500 m a.s.l.). For the bacterial community, phylogenetically Betaproteobacteria prevailed, followed by Alphaproteobacteria and Actinobacteria; at the finer genus level, Limnohabitans and Variovorax were prominent. Along the river, the bacterial community showed a continuous succession. Specifically, their alpha- and beta-diversity gradually increased, suggesting a distance-decay pattern. Additionally, there was an ecological transition between the dominant and the rare sub-community along the river: the relative abundance of the dominant members gradually decreased as the rare members increased. We report that temperature and spatial distance were significantly related to the variation of bacterial community. Variance partitioning analysis showed that the environmental factors contributed more to the bacterial community than did the spatial distance. In the case of the archaeal community, the methanogenic groups, mainly Methanosaeta and Methanosarcina, were prominent within the Kaidu river. Unlike the continuous change in the patterns of the bacterial community, the archaeal community showed a constant pattern along the river. Our results showed that the archaeal community was independent of the environmental and spatial factors. We propose that the inoculation of soil-derived archaea is responsible for the archaeal community in the Kaidu river.

These microaggregates are composed of diverse mineral, organic and biotic materials that are bound together during pedogenesis by various physical, chemical and biological processes. Consequently, microaggregates can withstand strong mechanical and physicochemical stresses and survive slaking in water, allowing them to persist in soils for several decades. Together with the physiochemical heterogeneity of their surfaces, the three-dimensional structure of microaggregates provides a large variety of ecological niches that contribute to the vast biological diversity found in soils. As reported for larger aggregate units, microaggregates are composed of smaller building units that become more complex with increasing size. In this context, organo-mineral associations can be considered structural units of soil aggregates and as nanoparticulate fractions of the microaggregates themselves. The mineral phases considered to be the most important as microaggregate forming materials are the clay minerals and Fe- and Al-(hydr)oxides. Within microaggregates, minerals are bound together primarily by physicochemical and chemical interactions involving cementing and gluing agents. The former comprise, among others, carbonates and the short-range ordered phases of Fe, Mn, and Al. The latter comprise organic materials of diverse origin and probably involve macromolecules and macromolecular mixtures. Work on microaggregate structure and development has largely focused on organic matter stability and turnover. However, little is known concerning the role microaggregates play in the fate of elements like Si, Fe, Al, P, and S. More recently, the role of microaggregates in the formation of microhabitats and the biogeography and diversity of microbial communities has been investigated. Little is known regarding how microaggregates and their properties change in time, which strongly limits our understanding of micro-scale soil structure dynamics. Similarly, only limited information is available on the mechanical stability of microaggregates, while essentially nothing is known about the flow and transport of fluids and solutes within the micro- and nanoporous microaggregate systems. Any quantitative approaches being developed for the modeling of formation, structure and properties of microaggregates are, therefore, in their infancy. We respond to the growing awareness of the importance of microaggregates for the structure, properties and functions of soils by reviewing what is currently known about the formation, composition and turnover of microaggregates. We aim to provide a better understanding of their role in soil function, and to present the major unknowns in current microaggregate research. We propose a harmonized concept for aggregates in soils that explicitly considers the structure and build-up of microaggregates and the role of organo-mineral associations. We call for experiments, studies and modeling endeavors that will link information on aggregate forming materials with their functional properties across a range of scales in order to better understand microaggregate formation and turnover. Finally, we hope to inspire a novel cohort of soil scientists that they might focus their research on improving our understanding of the role of microaggregates within the system of aggregates and so help to develop a unified and quantitative concept of aggregation processes in soils.",2018,181,10.1002/jpln.201600451

But it remains unclear how the soil properties and geographical distances affect the exoelectrogen communities of Chinese paddy soils. So the objectives of this study were to investigate the diversity and composition of these microbial communities which were enriched on the anodes of soil microbial fuel cells (SMFCs) and to elucidate the links between the microbial community compositions and their driving factors. We used Illumina HiSeq sequencing to determine the bacterial community structures which were enriched on the anodes of SMFCs. Variance partitioning analysis (VPA) was used to obtain the contribution of soil properties and geographical distance to the variations of bacterial communities. Active bacterial community on anodes of the closed circuit SMFCs differs significantly from the control open circuit SMFCs. Anodes of all the closed circuit SMFCs were characterized by the presence of high numbers of Nitrospira and Anaerolineae. Taxonomic similarities and phylogenetic similarities of bacterial communities from different paddy soil samples across North and South China were found to be significantly correlated with geographical distances. The relationship between the similarities and the geographic distance exhibited a distance-decay relationship. VPA showed that both geographical distances and soil properties affect the structure of bacterial communities detected on anodes. Our study gives a foundation for understanding the distribution and diversity of exoelectrogens in paddy soils and elucidates the links between the distribution and the diversity of extracellular respiring bacteria and their driving factors.

Whereas previous meta-analysis efforts have focused on bacterial diversity measures or abundances of major taxa, we show that disparate amplicon sequence data can be combined at the taxonomy-based level to assess bacterial community structure. We find that rarer taxa are more important for structuring soil communities than abundant taxa, and that these rarer taxa are better predictors of community structure than environmental factors, which are often confounded across studies.

We compared diversity and biogeographical patterns of cultivable and noncultivable root endophytes to assess whether their occurrence is determined by distinct ecological factors. The endophytic diversity in roots of nonmycorrhizal Microthlaspi spp. growing across Europe was assessed using high-throughput sequencing (HTS) and compared with a previous dataset based on cultivation of endophytes from the same root samples. HTS revealed a large fungal richness undetected by cultivation, but which largely comprised taxa with restricted distributions and/or low representation of sequence reads. Both datasets coincided in a consistent high representation of widespread endophytes within orders Pleosporales, Hypocreales and Helotiales, as well as similar associations of community structure with spatial and environmental conditions. Likewise, distributions of particular endophytes inferred by HTS agreed with cultivation data in suggesting individual ecological preferences. Our findings support that Microthlaspi spp. roots are colonized mostly by saprotrophic and likely facultative endophytes, and that differential niche preferences and distribution ranges among fungi importantly drive the assembly of root-endophytic communities.",2018,217,10.1111/nph.14873

Flagellate genotypes determined from sedimentary DNA deep-sea samples might originate from vital deep-sea populations or from cysts of organisms sedimented down from surface waters. The latter one may have never been active under deep-sea conditions. We wanted to analyze the principal ability of cultivable heterotrophic flagellates of different phylogenetic groups (choanoflagellates, ancyromonads, euglenids, kinetoplastids, bicosoecids, chrysomonads, and cercozoans) to survive exposure to high hydrostatic pressure (up to 670 bar). We summarized our own studies and the few available data from literature on pressure tolerances of flagellates isolated from different marine habitats. Our results demonstrated that many different flagellate species isolated from the surface waters and deep-sea sediments survived drastic changes in hydrostatic pressure. Barophilic behavior was also recorded for several species isolated from the deep sea indicating their possible genetic adaptation to high pressures.

Three operational taxonomic units (OTUs), whose distribution were significantly different between 5-m and 75-m water layers, all belonged to Flavobacteriales of the Bacteroidetes (p < 0.05). In addition, bacterioplankton community richness and diversity at the continental shelf (CS) was generally higher than at oceanic stations (SB and KI). Five OTUs, which favored the habitat of continental shelf, belonged to Alphaproteobacteria including the orders of the SAR11 cluster, Rhodospirillales, Rhodobacterales and other unclassified orders (p < 0.05). Two OTUs, which favored the habitat of oceanic stations, were assigned to the orders of Flavobacteriales and Alteromonadales. Furthermore, the abundances of two OTUs belonging to the Cyanobacteria phylum and Verrucomicrobiales order were significantly different between the sea basin (SB) and Kuroshio influenced area (KI) stations (p < 0.05).",2018,73,10.2478/s11756-018-0023-8

Due to the finding of several genes encoding symbiosis factors, such as adhesins, ankyrin repeats and tetratricopeptide repeats, the candidate phylum Poribacteria is considered as a promising model microorganism for studying the origin of host-symbiont interactions in sponges. However, relatively little is known about its global diversity and phylogenetic distribution among different sponge hosts. Therefore, in this study we investigated phylogenetic relationships among poribacterial phylotypes and generated a phylogenetic network to examine the distribution and intraspecific diversity of the phylotypes between phylogenetically divergent host-sponges at a global scale. For this study 361 poribacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences obtained by Sanger sequencing from 15 different countries and 8 marine regions were gathered. We could demonstrate that the candidate phylum Poribacteria is composed of diverse phylotypes, which are distributed among a wide range of phylogenetically divergent sponge hosts. The current phylogenetic analyses found neither conclusive evidence for co-speciation with its hosts, nor biogeographical correlation. Moreover, we identified a novel poribacterial clade, which might represent a link between the previously established four Poribacteria clades.",2018,10,10.1111/1758-2229.12609

Here, we investigated the community composition and geographical distributions of benthic microeukaryotes using high-throughput sequencing of the 18S rRNA gene and quantified the contributions of environmental factors and spatial separation on the distribution patterns of both rare and abundant taxa. We collected 36 intertidal samples at 12 sandy beaches from four regions that spanned distances from 0.001 to 12,000 km. We found 12,890 operational taxonomic units (OTUs; 97% sequence identity level) including members of all eukaryotic super-groups and several phyla of uncertain position. Arthropoda and Diatomeae dominated the sequence reads in abundance, but Ciliophora and Discoba were the most diverse groups across all samples. About one-third of the OTUs could not be definitively classified at a similarity level of 80%, supporting the view that a large number of rare and minute marine species may have escaped previous characterization. We found generally similar geographical patterns for abundant and rare microeukaryotic sub-communities, and both showed a significant distance-decay similarity trend. Variation partitioning showed that both rare and abundant sub-communities exhibited a slightly stronger response to environmental factors than spatial (distance) factors. However, the abundant sub-community was strongly correlated with variations in spatial, environmental and sediment grain size factors (66% of variance explained), but the rare assemblage was not (16%). This suggests that different or more complex mechanisms generate and maintain diversity in the rare biosphere in this habitat.",2018,20,10.1111/1462-2920.13916

Globally, the V4 and V9 regions of the 18S rRNA gene provided similar images of alpha diversity and ecological patterns. However, V9 provided 20% more OTUs built at 97% identity than V4. 34% of the genera were found with both markers and, of the remnant, 22% were found only with V4 and 44% only with V9. For photosynthetic groups, V4 and V9 performed equally well to describe global communities at different taxonomic levels from the division to the genus and provided similar Chlorophyta distribution patterns. However, at lower taxonomic level, the V9 dataset failed for example to describe the diversity of Dolichomastigales (Chlorophyta, Mamiellophyceae) emphasizing the lack of V9 sequences for this group and the importance of the reference database for metabarcode analysis. We conclude that in order to address questions regarding specific groups (e.g., a given genus), it is necessary to choose the marker based not only on the genetic divergence within this group but also on the existence of reference sequences in databases.",2018,20,10.1111/1462-2920.13952

In contrast, there have been few comparable studies of how range size varies across microbial taxa and what traits may be associated with this variation. We determined the range sizes of 74,134 bacterial and archaeal taxa found in settled dust collected from 1,065 locations across the United States. We found that most microorganisms have small ranges and few have large ranges, a pattern similar to the range size distributions commonly observed for macrobes.

Nonetheless, phylogenetic scale has never been formally conceptualized, and its potential remains largely unexplored. Here, we formalize the concept of phylogenetic scale, review how phylogenetic scale has been considered across multiple fields and provide practical guidelines for the use of phylogenetic scale to address a range of biological questions. Innovation: We summarize how phylogenetic scale has been treated in macroevolution, community ecology, biogeography and macroecology, illustrating how it can inform, and possibly resolve, some of the longstanding controversies in these fields. To promote the concept empirically, we define phylogenetic grain and extent, scale dependence, scaling and the domains of phylogenetic scale. We illustrate how existing phylogenetic data and statistical tools can be used to investigate the effects of scale on a variety of well-known patterns and processes, including diversification rates, community structure, niche conservatism or species-abundance distributions. Main conclusions: Explicit consideration of phylogenetic scale can provide new and more complete insight into many longstanding questions across multiple fields (macroevolution, community ecology, biogeography and macroecology).

However, little is known about the relative importance of species sorting and dispersal limitation in shaping marine microbial communities; especially, how they are related to organism types/traits and water depth. Here, we used variation partitioning and null model analysis to compare mechanisms driving bacterial and protist metacommunity dynamics at the basin scale in the East China Sea, based on MiSeq paired-end sequencing of 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and 18S rDNA, respectively, in surface, deep chlorophyll maximum and bottom layers. Our analyses indicated that protist communities were governed more strongly by species sorting relative to dispersal limitation than were bacterial communities; this pattern was consistent across the three-depth layers, albeit to different degrees. Furthermore, we detected that bacteria exhibited wider habitat niche breadths than protists, whereas, passive dispersal abilities were not appreciably different between them. Our findings support the size-plasticity hypothesis: smaller organisms (bacteria) are less environment filtered than larger organisms (protists), as smaller organisms are more likely to be plastic in metabolic abilities and have greater environmental tolerance.",2018,12,10.1038/ismej.2017.183

The draft genome of the isolate encodes all of the enzymatic machinery necessary for both oxygenic and anoxygenic photosynthesis, as well as genes for methylating hopanoids at the C-2 position. The physiological response of the isolate to H2S is complex: (i) no induction time is necessary for anoxygenic photosynthesis; (ii) rates of anoxygenic photosynthesis are regulated by both H2S and irradiance; (iii) O-2 production is inhibited by H2S concentrations as low as 1 mu M and the recovery rate of oxygenic photosynthesis is dependent on irradiance; (iv) under the optimal light conditions for oxygenic photosynthesis, rates of anoxygenic photosynthesis are nearly double those of oxygenic photosynthesis. We hypothesize that the specific adaptation mechanisms of the isolate to H2S emerged from a close spatial interaction with sulfate-reducing bacteria. The new isolate, Leptolyngbya sp. strain hensonii, is not closely related to other well-characterized Cyanobacteria that can perform anoxygenic photosynthesis, which further highlights the need to characterize the diversity and biogeography of metabolically versatile Cyanobacteria.

"Sauze, J; Jones, SP; Wingate, L; Wohl, S; Ogee, J",The role of soil pH on soil carbonic anhydrase activity,BIOGEOSCIENCES,"Carbonic anhydrases (CAs) are metalloenzymes present in plants and microorganisms that catalyse the inter-conversion of CO2 and water to bicarbonate and protons. Because oxygen isotopes are also exchanged during this reaction, the presence of CA also modifies the contribution of soil and plant (COO)-O-18 fluxes to the global budget of atmospheric (COO)-O-18. The oxygen isotope signatures (delta O-18) of these fluxes differ as leaf water pools are usually more enriched than soil water pools, and this difference is used to partition the net CO2 flux over land into soil respiration and plant photosynthesis. Nonetheless, the use of atmospheric (COO)-O-18 as a tracer of land surface CO2 fluxes requires a good knowledge of soil CA activity. Previous studies have shown that significant differences in soil CA activity are found in different biomes and seasons, but our understanding of the environmental and ecological drivers responsible for the spatial and temporal patterns observed in soil CA activity is still limited. One factor that has been overlooked so far is pH. Soil pH is known to strongly influence microbial community composition, richness and diversity in addition to governing the speciation of CO2 between the different carbonate forms. In this study we investigated the CO2-H2O isotopic exchange rate (k(iso)) in six soils with pH varying from 4.5 to 8.5. We also artificially increased the soil CA concentration to test how pH and other soil properties (texture and phosphate content) affected the relationship between k(iso) and CA concentration. We found that soil pH was the primary driver of k(iso) after CA addition and that the chemical composition (i.e. phosphate content) played only a secondary role. We also found an offset between the delta O-18 of the water pool with which CO2 equilibrates and total soil water (i.e. water extracted by vacuum distillation) that varied with soil texture. The reasons for this offset are still unknown.",2018,15,10.5194/bg-15-597-2018

The performed high-throughput sequencing to investigate the distribution of bacterial taxa along spatial and environmental gradients. The results showed bacterial communities presented remarkable horizontal and vertical distribution under coastal gradients of spatial and environmental factors. Fourteen abundant taxa clustered the samples into three distinctive groups, reflecting typical habitats in shallow coastal water (seafloor depth <= 20 m), sunlit surface layer (at water surface with seafloor depth >20 m) and bottom water (at 2-3 m above sediment with seafloor depth >20 m), The most significant taxa of each cluster were determined by the least discriminant analysis effect size, and strongly correlated with spatial and environmental variables. Environmental factors (especially turbidity and nitrite) exhibited significant influences on bacterial beta-diversity in surface water (at 0 m sampling depth), while community similarity in bottom water (at 2-3 m above sediment) was mainly determined by depth. In both surface and bottom water, we found bacterial community similarity and the number of OTUs shared between every two sites decreased with increasing geographic distance, Bacterial dispersal was also affected by phosphate, which was possible due to the high ratios of IN/IP in this coastal sea area.",2018,6,10.7717/peerj.4272

In comparison, metagenomes facilitate highly resolved investigations of the relative distribution of microbial genomes and individual genes across environments through read recruitment analyses. Combining these complementary approaches can yield unique insights into the functional basis of microbial niche partitioning and fitness, however, advanced software solutions are lacking. Here we present an integrated analysis arid visualization strategy that provides an interactive arid reproducible frame work to generate pangenomes arid to study them in conjunction with metagenomes. To investigate its utility, we applied this strategy to a Prochlorococcus pangenorne in the context of a large-scale marine rnetagenornic survey. The resulting Prochlorococcus metapangenome revealed remarkable differential abundance patterns between very closely related isolates that belonged to the same phylogenetic cluster and that differed by only a small number of gene clusters in the pangenome. While the relationships between these genornes based on gene clusters correlated with their environmental distribution patterns, pylogenetic analyses using marker genes or concatenated single-copy core genes did not recapitulate these patterns. The metapangenome also revealed a small set of core genes that mostly occurred in hypervariable genornic islands of the Prochlorococcus populations, which systematically lacked read recruitment from surface ocean metagenomes. Notably, these core gene clusters were all linked to sugar metabolism, suggesting potential benefits to Prochlorococcus from a high sequence diversity of sugar metabolism genes.

The microbial communities associated with this species showed biogeographical differences, but shared a common core microbiome that probably plays a key role in the coral holobiont. The putatively pathogenic microbial assemblage (i.e., pathobiome) of C. caespitosa also seemed to depend on geographic location and the human footprint. In locations near the coast and with higher human influence, the pathobiome was entirely constituted by Vibrio species, including the well-known coral pathogens Vibrio coralliilyticus and V. mediterranei. However, in the Columbretes Islands, located off the coast and the most pristine of the analyzed locations, no changes among microbial communities associated to healthy and necrosed samples were detected.

However, little is presently known about the integrated biogeography of planktonic and sedimentary bacterial communities in large rivers. Results: This study provides the first spatiotemporal pattern of bacterial communities in the Yangtze River, the largest river in Asia with a catchment area of 1,800,000 km(2). We find that sedimentary bacteria made larger contributions than planktonic bacteria to the bacterial diversity of the Yangzte River ecosystem with the sediment subgroup providing 98. 8% of 38,906 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) observed in 280 samples of synchronous flowing water and sediment at 50 national monitoring stations covering a 4300 km reach. OTUs within the same phylum displayed uniform seasonal variations, and many phyla demonstrated autumn preference throughout the length of the river. Seasonal differences in bacterial communities were statistically significant in water, whereas bacterial communities in both water and sediment were geographically clustered according to five types of landforms: mountain, foothill, basin, foothill-mountain, and plain. Interestingly, the presence of two huge dams resulted in a drastic fall of bacterial taxa in sediment immediately downstream due to severe riverbed scouring. The integrity of the biogeography is satisfactorily interpreted by the combination of neutral and species sorting perspectives in meta-community theory for bacterial communities in flowing water and sediment. Conclusions: Our study fills a gap in understanding of bacterial communities in one of the worlds largest river and highlights the importance of both planktonic and sedimentary communities to the integrity of bacterial biogeographic patterns in a river subject to varying natural and anthropogenic impacts.",2018,6,10.1186/s40168-017-0388-x

A major source of Fe to the open ocean is Aeolian dust deposition in which Fe is largely comprised of particles with reduced bioavailability over soluble forms of Fe. We report that Trichodesmium erythraeum IMS101 has improved growth rate and photosynthetic physiology and down-regulates Fe-stress biomarker genes when cells are grown in the direct vicinity of, rather than physically separated from, Saharan dust particles as the sole source of Fe. These findings suggest that availability of non-soluble forms of dust-associated Fe may depend on cell contact. Transcriptomic analysis further reveals unique profiles of gene expression in all tested conditions, implying that Trichodesmium has distinct molecular signatures related to acquisition of Fe from different sources.

"Zhivic, I; Ostojic, A; Miljanovic, B; Markovic, Z",MACROINVERTEBRATES OF SERBIAN STREAMS AND THEIR SIGNIFICANCE AS BIOINDICATORS IN ESTIMATION OF WATER QUALITY,ECOLOGICAL AND ECONOMIC SIGNIFICANCE OF FAUNA OF SERBIA,"Despite the fact that it represents only a small part of the total amount of water on the planet (1.2%), land-based water is very significant for man. The demographic explosion that marked the 20th century on the one hand caused constant growth of the need for pure water and on the other hand increased the extent of water pollution due to development of industry, intensification of agriculture and expansion of urban regions. Human action leads to greater or lesser changes of ecological factors in aquatic ecosystems (amount of dissolved oxygen, pH, heavy metal concentration, etc.), regulation of watercourses, disruption of communication between biocoenoses and disturbance of the natural water regime (through the creation of reservoirs). All of this brings about changes in biocoenoses that can be very pronounced, going even so far as to the virtual destruction of life in an aquatic ecosystem or in less severe cases to replacement of an existing biocoenosis by a new one that due to greater homogeneity of ecological factors is characterized by lower diversity. In order to conserve the water resources of the Republic of Serbia, it is necessary to monitor them closely. Biomonitoring is an obligatory part of this task because it is a simple, fast and economical way to follow the state of ecosystems of land-based water. Of all groups of aquatic organisms used in biomonitoring: bacteria, protozoans, zooplankton, phytobenthos, macrophytes and fish, macroinvertebrates are the most widely employed, especially in streams, where they are absolutely the most significant community of bioindicatory organisms. Modern biomonitoring of streams both in the world at large and in Serbia is based to the greatest extent on the use of macroinvertebrates as bioindicators of water quality owing to their many advantages over other aquatic organisms. Macroinvertebrates are widely disseminated organisms that inhabit various types of aquatic ecosystems, from little temporary (ephemeral) stagnant pools, small springs and creeks to large lakes and rivers. The great diversity of macrozoobenthic organisms and extremely complex structure of their communities on the one hand make them very sensitive to anthropogenic action causing changes of ecological factors, and on the other hand enable them potentially to respond with changes in the composition of their biocoenoses that are proportional to intensity of the anthropogenic action in question. Such organisms are characterized by the ability to persist in conditions of fast flowing water because they live attached to the bottom, possess long life cycles and have limited mobility. Their low mobility and sedentary way of life enable the investigator to establish the state of ecological factors on a given area. The relatively long life cycles (lasting 2-3 years) of these organisms make it possible to investigate changes occurring over the course of time. Apart from biological considerations, there are also numerous practical reasons why these organisms are considered good indicators of water quality: samples are taken with relatively inexpensive equipment; the taxonomy of most groups has been thoroughly elaborated; keys for their identification are available; methods that employ macrozoobenthic organisms have been used for many years and are highly reliable; and the responses of certain organisms to different types and levels of pollution have been precisely defined. Macrozoobenthic organisms can be used to test the influence of anthropogenic stress on aquatic. biotopes at all levels of biological organization, from molecular to ecosystematic. The effects of pollution on these organisms under natural conditions are most often analysed on the level of their populations or communities, using structural attributes (measured by indexes of diversity and similarity, biotic indexes, etc.) or functional characteristics, including, for example, primary production, respiratory processes, biomass (secondary production) and circulation of elements, but also aspects of the organisms life history such as functional guilds in the feeding of a taxon. Investigation of macrozoobenthic communities has been and will be a central part of the ecology of land-based water, partly due to the fact that streams for them represent a crucial link between resources in the form of organic matter (for example, fallen leaves, algae, detritus, etc.) and fish in food webs, and partly due to the diversity and wide dissemination of the organisms involved. In view of these facts, it is unsurprising that systematic research on the fauna of macroinvertebrates in land-based water of Serbia was initiated almost a century ago and has been carried out in continuity with varying intensity up to the present day. More intensive use of macroinvertebrates in biomonitoring of the ecosystems of land-based water in Serbia, as in the world at large, began around the middle of the last century, at which time they started to be included in monitoring of water quality by the Hydrometeorological Institute of Serbia. As can be seen from the above, Serbian science actively followed world trends in biomonitoring of land-based water from the very start, although the intensity of these investigations was highly variable. Intensification of research on macroinvertebrates and their use in biomonitoring of land-based water occurred during the 1990s, with the formation in Novi Sad, Belgrade and Kragujevac of several independent teams of investigators that laid a solid foundation for further progress, as is evident in a series of studies introducing new and modern methods of biomonitoring, methods such as employment of biomarkers, recording of morphological asymmetries and deformities and use of artificial neuron networks. To be specific, the work of these teams has greatly advanced available knowledge about biology of the macroinvertebrates of land-based water in Serbia and continued to keep pace with world trends in their use for biomonitoring. A good example is the development of BNBI and incorporation of a number of EU standard methods into norms for regulation of biomonitoring in Serbia. Despite this positive trend, it must be stated that the use of macroinvertebrates as bioindicators of the quality of land-based water in Serbia is relatively limited because in the majority of cases it is done within the framework of saprobiological analyses, whereas biotic indexes are for the most part unjustifiably ignored, while multimetric indexes and the multivariant approach have not even begun to be employed. For these reasons, the state of biomomitoring in Serbia still cannot be considered satisfactory. To be specific, if the extent of land-based water biomonitoring in Great Britain where it is continuously conducted at more than 6000 localities is compared with the state of affairs in Serbia where about 90 localities out of a planned 500 are continuously monitored it can be seen that the level of biomonitoring in our country is disproportionally lower. Moreover, a comparison of stream quality in Great Britain, despite that countrys significantly more advanced industrial development and greater population density, with the situation in Serbia shows that the quality of streams in our country is conspicuously far worse. It is clearly necessary to expand the volume and content of biomonitoring because only in that way will it be possible to make correct decisions in the management of water resources and thereby improve their quality. Meanwhile, at the existing level of macroinvertebrate studies in Serbia, that is not simply a question of political willingness, but also a task limited by the quality and quantity of fundamental research. As has been stated before, successful use of macroinvertebrates in biomonitoring demands an exceptionally good knowledge of the base reference state. That at the present time calls for additional faunistic, taxonomic, biogeographic and toxicological research, as well as studies on the typization of watercourses. It will be possible to define groups of reference localities in Serbia, as has been done in Great Britain, only if the inventory of species in our country is known in detail, if taxonomic problems are resolved, if keys for the identification of species are available, if their range has been clarified and if the types of watercourses and their ecological status (condition) are known. This in turn will make it possible to apply some highly organized system of biomonitoring like RIVPACS or to develop a multimetric index like the ones elaborated in the EUs AQEM program. That the path to this goal is long is clearly indicated by the fact although acknowledged experts today exist for the taxonomy of macroinvertebrate groups such as Chironomidae, Oligochaeta, Heteroptera, Trichoptera, Amphipoda and Gastropoda, research on a number of very important groups such as Ephemeroptera and Plecoptera has only just begun, a situation that has a significant effect on the quality and reliability of determination of these groups, knowledge about their distribution and awareness of their ecological preferences, as well as on the typization of land-based water habitats in Serbia vis-a-vis other countries in the world. Progress in this area largely depends on politics of the state, that is on the measure in which it is ready to support studies, finance the necessary increase in the number of researchers and through selection of programs and projects guide investigative efforts in an appropriate direction. It is also necessary to widen the network of localities at which sampling is prescribed by law, since only by sampling in an organized and planned manner will it be possible to collect an adequate number of data in a procedurally uniform way permitting the drawing of comparisons, development of new biomononitoring methods in Serbia and improvement of ones already in existence. That is the only way to form a standardized database of information about the ecosystems of Serbian streams. Such a database will be the foundation needed for the standardization of reference localities, which represents a key step toward the implementation of both multivariant and multimetric methods in biomonitoring.",2018,171,

Initial work on the molecular epidemiology of this fungal pathogen utilized genotyping approaches to describe the genetic diversity and biogeography of two species, Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii. Whole genome sequencing of representatives of both species resulted in reference assemblies enabling a wide array of downstream studies and genomic resources. With the increasing availability of whole genome sequencing, both species have now had hundreds of individual isolates sequenced, providing fine-scale insight into the evolution and diversification of Cryptococcus and allowing for the first genome-wide association studies to identify genetic variants associated with human virulence. Sequencing has also begun to examine the microevolution of isolates during prolonged infection and to identify variants specific to outbreak lineages, highlighting the potential role of hyper-mutation in evolving within short time scales. We can anticipate that further advances in sequencing technology and sequencing microbial genomes at scale, including metagenomics approaches, will continue to refine our view of how the evolution of Cryptococcus drives its success as a pathogen.",2018,113,10.1590/0074-02760170473

Although the plant-associated microbiome has substantial influence on plant growth and health, there is limited knowledge of the banana microbiome and its influencing factors. We studied the impact of i) biogeography, ii) agroforestry, and iii) Fusarium wilt (race 1) infestation on the banana-associated gammaproteobacterial microbiome analyzing Gros Michel (AAA genome) grown in Nicaragua and Costa Rica. Additionally, we investigated iv) the microbiome of the East African highland bananas (EAHB, AAA genome) treated with different organic soil amendment combinations of mulch and manure, and v) the microbiome stability of Xanthomonas wilt-resistant transgenic Sukari Ndizi (AAB genome) in Uganda. Overall, the gammaproteobacterial banana microbiome was dominated by Pseudomonadales, Enterobacteriales and Xanthomonadales. An extraordinary high diversity of gammaproteobacterial microbiota was observed within the endophytic microenvironments, endorhiza and pseudostem. Enterobacteria were identified as a highly dominant group in aerial plant parts, especially of the pseudostem and leaves. Our studies show that the gammaproteobacterial banana microbiome is influenced by biogeography and banana cultivar. Work also corroborates findings that agroforestry leads to increased plant health via shifts within the microbiome. In this light, a sophisticated design of manipulating plant microbiomes can help us reduce pesticide and fertilizer use. Using gammaproteobacterial health indicators can help preventing Fusarium wilt infestation. Organic management practices lead to increased microbial soil diversity. Further studies based on more holistic population microbiology are necessary to potentially extend this behavior to the entire microbial community. Our risk assessment shows a stable microbiome for Xanthomonas wilt-resistant transgenic bananas with no consequences for non-target rhizobacteria, although additional studies should address the microbiome stability over a longer time frame.",2018,1196,10.17660/ActaHortic.2018.1196.1
"Chidebe, IN; Jaiswal, SK; Dakora, FD",Distribution and Phylogeny of Microsymbionts Associated with Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) Nodulation in Three Agroecological Regions of Mozambique,APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY,"Cowpea derives most of its N nutrition from biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) via symbiotic bacteroids in root nodules. In Sub-Saharan Africa, the diversity and biogeographic distribution of bacterial microsymbionts nodulating cowpea and other indigenous legumes are not well understood, though needed for increased legume production. The aim of this study was to describe the distribution and phylogenies of rhizobia at different agroecological regions of Mozambique using PCR of the BOX element (BOX-PCR), restriction fragment length polymorphism of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS-RFLP), and sequence analysis of ribosomal, symbiotic, and housekeeping genes. A total of 122 microsymbionts isolated from two cowpea varieties (IT-1263 and IT-18) grouped into 17 clades within the BOX-PCR dendrogram. The PCR-ITS analysis yielded 17 ITS types for the bacterial isolates, while ITS-RFLP analysis placed all test isolates in six distinct clusters (I to VI). BLASTn sequence analysis of 16S rRNA and four housekeeping genes (glnII, gyrB, recA, and rpoB) showed their alignment with Rhizobium and Bradyrhizobium species. The results revealed a group of highly diverse and adapted cowpea-nodulating microsymbionts which included Bradyrhizobium pachyrhizi, Bradyrhizobium arachidis, Bradyrhizobium yuanmingense, and a novel Bradyrhizobium sp., as well as Rhizobium tropici, Rhizobium pusense, and Neorhizobium galegae in Mozambican soils. Discordances observed in single-gene phylogenies could be attributed to horizontal gene transfer and/or subsequent recombinations of the genes. Natural deletion of 60 bp of the gyrB region was observed in isolate TUTVU7; however, this deletion effect on DNA gyrase function still needs to be confirmed. The inconsistency of nifH with core gene phylogenies suggested differences in the evolutionary history of both chromosomal and symbiotic genes. IMPORTANCE A diverse group of both Bradyrhizobium and Rhizobium species responsible for cowpea nodulation in Mozambique was found in this study. Future studies could prove useful in evaluating these bacterial isolates for symbiotic efficiency and strain competitiveness in Mozambican soils.",2018,84,10.1128/AEM.01712-17

Illumina MiSeq high-throughput sequencing was performed to characterize the soil bacterial communities in 5 aggregate size classes in each treatment. The results indicated that reclamation significantly increased macro-aggregation (> 0.25 mm), as well as soil organic C, available N, and available P. The 10-year field had the largest proportion (93.9%) of soil in the macro-aggregate size classes (i.e., > 0.25 mm) and the highest soil electrical conductivity. The 5 most dominant phyla in the soil samples were Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Gemmatimonadetes, Acidobacteria, and Bacteroidetes. The phylogenetic diversity, Chao1, and Shannon indices increased after the abandoned land was reclaimed for farming, reaching maximums in the 15-year field. Among aggregate size classes, the 1-0.25 mm aggregates generally had the highest phylogenetic diversity, Chao1, and Shannon indices. Soil organic C and soil electrical conductivity were the main environmental factors affecting the soil bacterial communities. The composition and structure of the bacterial communities also varied significantly depending on soil aggregate size and time since reclamation.",2018,64,10.1139/cjm-2017-0362

In deep sea environments, fungal communities remain less studied despite their known taxonomic and functional diversity. High-throughput sequencing methods have augmented our capacity to assess eukaryotic diversity and their functions in microbial ecology. Here we provide the first description of the fungal community diversity found in deep sea sediments collected at the Southwest Indian Ridge (SWIR) using culture-dependent and high throughput sequencing approaches. A total of 138 fungal isolates were cultured from seven different sediment samples using various nutrient media, and these isolates were identified to 14 fungal taxa, including 11 Ascomycota taxa (7 genera) and 3 Basidiomycota taxa (2 genera) based on internal transcribed spacers (ITS1, ITS2 and 5.8S) of rDNA. Using illumina HiSeq sequencing, a total of 757,467 fungal ITS2 tags were recovered from the samples and clustered into 723 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) belonging to 79 taxa (Ascomycota and Basidiomycota contributed to 99% of all samples) based on 97% sequence similarity. Results from both approaches suggest that there is a high fungal diversity in the deep-sea sediments collected in the SWIR and fungal communities were shown to be slightly different by location, although all were collected from adjacent sites at the SWIR. This study provides baseline data of the fungal diversity and biogeography, and a glimpse to the microbial ecology associated with the deep-sea sediments of the hydrothermal vent system of the Southwest Indian Ridge.",2018,131,10.1016/j.dsr.2017.11.001

However, the distribution of plant species and soils are highly variable even within a tropical region. This paper reviews existing and novel knowledge on soil genesis, plant and microbial physiology, and biogeochemistry. Typically, forests in Southeast Asia are dominated by dipterocarps growing on acidic Ultisols from relatively young parent material. In the Neotropics and Africa, forests contain abundant legume trees growing on Oxisols developed in the older parent materials on stable continental shields. In Southeast Asia, the removal of base cations from the surface soil due to leaching and uptake by dipterocarp trees result in intensive acidification and accumulation of exchangeable Al3, which is toxic to most plants. Nutrient mining by ectomycorrhizal fungi and efficient allocation within tree organs can supply phosphorus (P) for reproduction (e.g., mast fruiting) even on P-limited soils. In the Neotropics and Africa, nitrogen (N) fixation by legume trees can ameliorate N or P limitation but excess N can promote acidification through nitrification. Biological weathering [e.g., plant silicon (Si) cycling] and leaching can lead to loss of Si from soil. The resulting accumulation of Al and Fe oxides in Oxisols that can reduce P solubility through sorption and lead to limitation of P relative to N. Thus, geographical variation in geology and plant species drives patterns of soil weathering and niche differentiation at the global scale in tropical forests.",2018,33,10.1007/s11284-017-1511-y

One such example is the production of metal-detoxifying siderophores. Here, we investigate whether conflicting selection pressures on siderophore production by heavy metals - a detoxifying effect of siderophores, and exploitation of this detoxifying effect - result in a net increase or decrease. We show that the proportion of siderophore-producing taxa increases along a natural heavy metal gradient. A causal link between metal contamination and siderophore production was subsequently demonstrated in a microcosm experiment in compost, in which we observed changes in community composition towards taxa that produce relatively more siderophores following copper contamination. We confirmed the selective benefit of siderophores by showing that taxa producing large amounts of siderophore suffered less growth inhibition in toxic copper. Our results suggest that ecological selection will favour siderophore-mediated decontamination, with important consequences for potential remediation strategies.",2018,21,10.1111/ele.12878

In this study, we explored the microbial diversity present in the phyllosphere of a very diverse set of grapevine cultivars representing the three genetic pools of the species, grown on an experimental plot at Montpellier (French Mediterranean region). We assessed microbiome variation in the phyllosphere using amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS), according to the grapevine genetic pools or cultivars, and organs (i.e. leaves and grape berries). The observed microbiome was complex; out of 542 bacterial genera; Pseudomonas, Pantoea, Sphingomonas, and Acinetobacter were the most abundant and almost ubiquitously present across the samples, and out of 267 fungal genera; Aureobasidium, Alternaria, Mycosphaerella and Aspergillus were most represented.

Despite the crucial ecological role of bacteria, our understanding of their large-scale biogeography patterns across forests, and the processes that determine these patterns lags significantly behind that of macroorganisms. Here, we evaluated the geographic distributions of bacterial diversity and their driving factors across nine latitudinal forests along a 3,700-km north-south transect in eastern China, using high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Four of 32 phyla detected were dominant: Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria and Chloroflexi (relative abundance>5%). Significant increases in bacterial richness and phylogenetic diversity were observed for temperate forests compared with subtropical or tropical forests. The soil organic matter (SOM) mineralisation rate (SOMmin, an index of SOM availability) explained the largest significant variations in bacterial richness. Variation partition analysis revealed that the bacterial community structure was closely correlated with environmental variables and geographic distance, which together explained 80.5% of community variation. Among all environmental factors, climatic features (MAT and MAP) were the best predictors of the bacterial community structure, whereas soil pH and SOMmin emerged as the most important edaphic drivers of the bacterial community structure. Plant functional traits (community weighted means of litter N content) and diversity resulted in weak but significant correlations with the bacterial community structure. Our findings provide new evidence of bacterial biogeography patterns from tropical to cold temperate forests. Additionally, the results indicated a close linkage among soil bacterial diversity, climate and SOM decomposition, which is critical for predicting continental-scale responses under future climate change scenarios and promoting sustainable forest ecosystem services.",2018,32,10.1111/1365-2435.12952

Empirical studies have documented this pattern across many different organisms and locations. Our goal was to quantify the evidence for the global LDG and the associated spatial, taxonomic and environmental factors. We performed a meta-analysis on a large number of individual LDGs that have been published in the 14 years since Hillebrands ground-breaking meta-analysis of the LDG, using meta-analysis and metaregression approaches largely new to the fields of ecology and biogeography. Location: Global. Time period: January 2003-September 2015. Major taxa studied: Bacteria, protists, plants, fungi and animals. Methods: We synthesized the outcomes of 389 individual cases of LDGs from 199 papers published since 2003, using hierarchical mixed-effects meta-analysis and multiple meta-regression. Additionally, we re-analysed Hillebrands original dataset using modern methods. Results: We confirmed the generality of the LDG, but found the pattern to be weaker than was found in Hillebrands study. We identified previously unreported variation in LDG strength and slope across longitude, with evidence that the LDG is strongest in the Western Hemisphere. Locational characteristics, such as habitat and latitude range, contributed significantly to LDG strength, whereas organismal characteristics, including taxonomic group and trophic level, did not. Modern meta-analytical models that incorporate hierarchical structure led to more conservative and sometimes contrasting effect size estimates relative to Hillebrands initial analysis, whereas metaregression revealed underlying patterns in Hillebrands dataset that were not apparent with a traditional analysis. Main conclusions: We present evidence of global latitudinal, longitudinal and habitat-based patterns in the LDG, which are apparent across both marine and terrestrial realms and over a broad taxonomic range of organisms, from bacteria to plants and vertebrates.",2018,27,10.1111/geb.12665

Here, we investigated spatial variations of fungal communities across three different types of temperate grasslands along a transect in the Inner Mongolia, China.

The composition and diversity of soil fungal community across 30 sites of the meadow steppe, typical steppe, and desert steppe along a 1200-km transect were studied through pyrosequencing. The relationships between fungal communities and environmental and biotic factors were assessed. The results showed that the fungal community along this transect exhibited strong dependence on soil moisture content and nitrate concentration, while the fungal alpha diversity was positively correlated with precipitation and below-ground biomass. Drier environment has resulted in a shift towards an Ascomycota-dominating fungal community. Our findings suggest that the distribution and community structure of soil fungal communities are primarily driven by precipitation.

Most research has focused on plant and microbial fructans and has received a growing interest because of their practical applications. Nevertheless, the origin of fructan production, the so-called fructan syndrome, is still unknown. Why fructans only occur in a limited number of plant and microbial species remains unclear. In this review, we provide an overview of plant and microbial fructan research with a focus on fructans as an adaptation to the environment and their role in (a)biotic stress tolerance. The taxonomical and biogeographical distribution of fructans in both kingdoms is discussed and linked (where possible) to environmental factors. Overall, the fructan syndrome may be related to water scarcity and differences in physicochemical properties, for instance, water retaining characteristics, at least partially explain why different fructan types with different branching levels are found in different species. Although a close correlation between environmental stresses and fructan production is quite clear in plants, this link seems to be missing in microbes. We hypothesize that this can be at least partially explained by differential evolutionary timeframes for plants and microbes, combined with potential redundancy effects. The capacity to biosynthesize fructans, fructose-based oligo and polysaccharides, is scattered over certain plant and microbial families. This review represents the first attempt to grasp the overall meaning of the fructan syndrome, crossing plants and microbes.

To better understand the relationship between the lung microbiome and early respiratory disease, we characterized the lower airways microbiome using bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples obtained from clinically stable CF infants and preschoolers who underwent bronchoscopy and chest computed tomography (CT). Cross-sectional samples suggested a progression of the lower airways microbiome with age, beginning with relatively sterile airways in infancy. By age two, bacterial sequences typically associated with the oral cavity dominated lower airways samples in many CF subjects. The presence of an oral-like lower airways microbiome correlated with a significant increase in bacterial density and inflammation. These early changes occurred in many patients, despite the use of antibiotic prophylaxis in our cohort during the first two years of life. The majority of CF subjects older than four harbored a pathogen dominated airway microbiome, which was associated with a further increase in inflammation and the onset of structural lung disease, despite a negligible increase in bacterial density compared to younger patients with an oral-like airway microbiome.

These topics were identified because of the substantial attention given to them during the course of the last half century, and due to their potential importance in issues of local and global expanse, such as: aquatic and terrestrial stability of habitats, ecosystem processes, biogeochemistry and climate change, and the role of eukaryotic microbes generally in ecosystem services. Moreover, there are close epistemological and thematic ties among the three topics, making a synthesis of the published research more systematic and productive. The number of reviewed publications for each of the three individual topics is presented to illustrate the trends in publication frequencies during the historical period of analysis. Overall, the number of total publications reviewed varied somewhat between 1965 and early 2000 (generally less than 10 per year), but increased to well over 10 per year after 2000. The number of Biogeography and Ecology studies identified in the online citations increased substantially after the mid 1990s, while studies focusing on Physiology were relatively more abundant in the first decade (1965-1974) and less were identified in the 1985 to 2004 period. Citations to the literature are listed in tables for each of the three topics for convenience in retrieving references to specific aspects, and representative examples of the cited research in the tables are reviewed in the text under subheads dedicated to each of the three topics. Biogeographic studies largely focused on the geographic distribution and localized patterns of occurrence of amoebae, with more recent studies incorporating more attention to likely correlates with environmental and biotic factors in the distribution and community composition of amoebae. Ecological studies reviewed in the later decades tended to focus more on community dynamics, the effects of environmental variables on communities (including climate-related topics), a trend toward more physiological ecology studies, combined field-based and experimental studies, and incorporation of newer methodologies such as molecular genetics. In general, physiology studies in the first decades of the review tended to focus on topics of cell physiology such as basic biochemistry, enzyme assays, mechanisms of cell division and development, encystment, and motility. Later studies examined broader topics such as osmoregulation, nutrition, fine structure evidence of cellular changes during the life cycle (including encystment and excystment), and issues related to asexual and sexual reproduction, with increasing substantial evidence of evolutionary patterns and phylogenetics based on molecular evidence. A final section on Conclusions and Recommendations summarizes the findings and presents some potentially productive approaches to future research studies on Amoebozoa within the three designated topics of analysis.",2018,57,10.4467/16890027AP.18.001.8395
"Anne, MH",APPROACHES FOR EUTROPHICATION CONTROL IN A MEXICAN RESERVOIR,REVISTA INTERNACIONAL DE CONTAMINACION AMBIENTAL,"Changes in land uses in hydrological river basins due to population growth and productive activities cause deterioration of water bodies, making lakes and reservoirs increasingly vulnerable to accelerated eutrophication processes [1]. Such processes are caused by internal nutrient loads from water and sediments and by external loads from wastewater discharges and runoff from the watershed [2]. These loads may stimulate growth of plants in water bodies, producing organic matter in water and sediment, where bacteria require oxygen for its degradation. This oxygen demand eventually causes anoxic conditions that promote internal nutrient loads [3]. Temperature differences as well as wind-driven mixing of water in lakes and reservoirs, distribute these nutrients, stimulating further plant growth, and reinforcing anoxic conditions and additional release of nutrients. It is therefore urgent to develop and apply methods for eutrophication control in lakes and reservoirs. In this paper, two different eutrophication control technologies were evaluated and compared: Application of the adsorbent Phoslock, and Hypolimnetic oxygenation. Although these technologies have been applied in lakes and reservoirs around the World [4], design parameters must be obtained for each case due to varying climatic, biogeographic, and anthropogenic characteristics of the lakes and reservoirs and their watersheds. Mass-balance models are required to describe remediation requirements for water bodies. In this study, mass balances were performed for target contaminants, remediation design parameters obtained, control scenarios evaluated, and a technical and economic analyses of the different solution options were carried out.",2018,34,

High-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons was performed and the functional profile was further predicted based on these data, in addition to examinations of bulk microbial properties. Data analyses suggested that, first of all, the FT amplitude significantly influenced the bulk microbial properties and bacterial community (composition and function); certain taxa showed a nonlinear response to the three amplitudes. Next, compared to a single FTC, multiple FT cycles had only minor effects on the bacterial functional capabilities, although the bulk microbial properties changed significantly after multiple FT cycles. In addition, the bacterial response to FTs was influenced by the SWC, characterized by the significantly different bacterial community structures (composition and function) and the opposite trends of enzyme activities. Finally, RDA plots and a correlation network assembled data from all soil samples across the three tests and suggested that bacterial response trajectories changed because some species were influenced mainly by other species (i.e., biotic environment) during FT processes.",2018,,10.1155/2018/8412429

Here, we present several analyses drawing on 583 new isolates collected from various substrates around the globe and publicly available sequences from numerous published environmental studies. We provide a multilocus phylogenetic reconstruction of the order, estimates for total species richness, a snapshot of global distribution patterns, and analysis of niche preferences in Sporidiobolales, emphasizing their occurrence in commercial crops and food products. We evaluated loci commonly used in fungal phylogenetics, finding that RNA polymerase II subunits 1 and 2 (RPB1, RPB2) are of little utility in this group. We have reconfirmed the monophyly of Sporidiobolales with three well-supported genera, which are, in descending order of number of species, Rhodotorula, Sporobolomyces, and Rhodosporidiobolus. From our data, we estimate ca. 260 species in Sporidiobolales, of which 42 are described, and ca. 52,000 species in Pucciniomycotina.

QIIME analysis of 16S rDNA of bacterial associates of major fauna from 1995 to 2015 was thus undertaken to examine phylogeography of their microbial symbionts along with host specificity. While phylotypes were generally unrelated, bivalve Calyptogena exhibited vertical transmission sharing similar symbionts in geographically separated geosystems. Different species of tubeworms possessed identical symbionts through horizontal acquisition at geographically distinct Guaymas basin vent and the Arctic seep. Vents were more versatile with both mobile and sessile fauna hosting ecto- and endo-symbionts. Comparatively, seeps were more specialized with sessile animal hosts with endosymbionts. C-fixation rate measurements are still scanty for sediments, bedrocks and serpentine systems; vent, seep, anoxic and oxic basins were shown to fix up to 22, 325, 96, and 37,400g C m(-3) y(-1), respectively.

Among them, two at high altitudes are known to contain ice year-round: Mauna Loa Icecave (MLIC) and the Arsia Cave. These unusual caves harbor cold, humid, dark, and biologically restricted environments. Secondary minerals and ice were sampled from both caves to explore their geochemical and microbiological characteristics. The minerals sampled from the deep parts of the caves, where near freezing temperatures prevail, are all multi-phase and consist mainly of secondary amorphous silica SiO2, cryptocrystalline calcite CaCO3, and gypsum CaSO4 center dot 2H(2)O. Based on carbon and oxygen stable isotope ratios, all sampled calcite is cryogenic. The isotopic composition of falls on the global meteoric line, indicating that little evaporation has occurred. The microbial diversity of a silica and calcite deposit in the MLIC and from ice pond water in the Arsia Cave was explored by analysis of similar to 50,000 small subunit ribosomal RNA gene fragments via amplicon sequencing. Analyses reveal that the Hawaiian ice caves harbor unique microbial diversity distinct from other environments, including cave environments, in Hawaii and worldwide. Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria were the most abundant microbial phyla detected, which is largely consistent with studies of other oligotrophic cave environments.

The East China Sea (ECS) is a complex and dynamic habitat with different water masses blending microbial communities. The internal transcribed spacer 2 region of fungal rDNA was analysed in water and sediment samples directly collected from the coastal (CWM), Kuroshio (KSWM), Taiwan warm (TWM) and the shelf mixed water mass (MWM), coupled with hydrographic properties measurements, to determine how ocean currents impact the fungal community composition. Almost 9k fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) spanning six phyla, 25 known classes, 102 orders and 694 genera were obtained. The typical terrestrial and freshwater fungal genus, Byssochlamys, was dominant in the CWM, while increasing abundance of a specific OTU affiliated with Aspergillus was revealed from coastal to open ocean water masses (TWM and KSWM). Compared with water samples, sediment harboured an increased diversity with distinct fungal communities. The proximity of the Yangtze and Qiantang estuaries homogenizes the surface water and sediment communities. A significant influence of ocean currents on community structure was found, which is believed to reduce proportionally the variation explained by environmental parameters at the scale of the total water masses. Dissolved oxygen and depth were identified as the major parameters structuring the fungal community. Our results indicate that passive fungal dispersal driven by ocean currents and river run-off, in conjunction with the distinct hydrographic conditions of individual water masses, shapes the fungal community composition and distribution pattern in the ECS.",2018,27,10.1111/mec.14440

Different methodological approaches are currently used; among them are enzyme activities (EA) and CLPP (community level physiological profile) techniques (e.g. MicroResp (TM), MR). The aims of the study were: i) to assess the efficacy of both methods in capturing differences among various land use categories when different levels of selected explanatory variables such as, total organic carbon (TOC) and pH are considered, and ii) to explore, through a quantile regression approach, the possible relationships between each of the two methods with land use category, TOC and pH. The Shannon diversity index (H), calculated from EA and MR data, was chosen as a synthetic index deriving from the same mathematical model. The quantile regression model (QRM), the Kruskal-Wallis and Spearman rank correlation tests were performed. Enzyme activities and MicroResp were reliable ecological indicators to assess soil microbial functional diversity. No correlation was found between the diversity indexes, HEA and HMR; it was therefore supposed that the two methods may target complementary components of microbial functional diversity. Both methods were effective in capturing differences among various land use categories, in particular HMR in soils with low TOC content (< 1.5%). Moreover, the QRM approach allowed a more detailed analysis along the distribution of the diversity indexes (HEA and HMR) indicating that HEA was more dependent on the selected variables.",2018,66,10.1016/j.pedobi.2018.01.001

The presence of tick-borne bacteria of the genera Rickettsia, Ehrlichia and Borrelia in the collected ticks was also evaluated. Samples of ticks parasitizing cattle and humans were carried out in different seasons. Questing ticks (adults and nymphs) were collected from vegetation and analyzed to detect the presence of Rickettsia, Ehrlichia and Borrelia by a battery of different PCRs. Five species of hard ticks were found parasitizing cattle: Amblyomma sculptum, Amblyomma tonelliae, Amblyomma hadanii, Haemaphysalis juxtakochi and Ixodes pararicinus. Amblyomma sculptum (immature and adults), A. tonelliae (immature and adults), A. hadanii (larvae) and one nymph of I. pararicinus were found attached to humans.

In this study we tested whether a group of microscopic animals, the bdelloid rotifers, sampled in a tropical country, could indeed be cosmopolitan, strictly tropical, and/or have endemic species. We sampled freshwater habitats throughout Thailand in dry and rainy seasons between 2014 and 2016, focusing on permanent water bodies, where the prevalence of species producing resting stages acting as propagules for dispersal should be minimal and thus dispersal limitation should exist, with several species being narrowly distributed. We used traditional morphological identification, geometric morphometric analyses on the shape and size of the jaws, and DNA taxonomy to identify species and to quantify the morphological and genetic distances of Thai samples in comparison with data on bdelloids from other areas in the world. We found a total of 12 species of planktonic and periphytic bdelloid rotifers, and all approaches we used, qualitative and quantitative, confirmed a group of nine potentially cosmopolitan species already known from other continents, one tropical oriental species, and two new species with a potentially narrow geographic distribution, one of which we here formally describe. We thus support the idea that for microscopic animals the moderate endemicity hypothesis suggested for protists may also hold true: most of the species we found indeed have a wide geographic distribution, but other species with narrower distributions do exist.http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:3DF5A913-BE6A-4EA4-88FD-C38C0F7AE00A",2018,16,10.1080/14772000.2017.1353554

Here, we performed dual-index Illumina sequencing of bacterial and archaeal communities on active and inactive sulfide chimneys collected from the Kolumbo hydrothermal field, situated on a geodynamic convergent setting. A total of 15,701 OTUs (operational taxonomic units) were assigned to 56 bacterial and 3 archaeal phyla, 133 bacterial and 16 archaeal classes. Active chimney communities were dominated by OTUs related to thermophilic members of Epsilonproteobacteria, Aquificae and Deltaproteobacteria. Inactive chimney communities were dominated by an OTU closely related to the archaeon Nitrosopumilus sp., and by members of Gammaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria, Planctomycetes and Bacteroidetes. These lineages are closely related to phylotypes typically involved in iron, sulfur, nitrogen, hydrogen and methane cycling. Overall, the inactive sulfide chimneys presented highly diverse and uniform microbial communities, in contrast to the active chimney communities, which were dominated by chemolithoautotrophic and thermophilic lineages.

Since fruits are ephemeral, they cannot comprise a permanent microbial habitat; thus, an age-old unanswered question concerns the origin of fruit and ferment associated microbes. Here we use next-generation sequencing approaches to examine and quantify the roles of native forest, vineyard soil, bark and fruit habitats as sources of fungal diversity in ferments. We show that microbial communities in harvested juice and ferments vary significantly across regions, and that while vineyard fungi account for similar to 40% of the source of this diversity, uncultivated ecosystems outside of vineyards also prove a significant source. We also show that while communities in harvested juice resemble those found on grapes, these increasingly resemble fungi present on vine bark as the ferment proceeds.",2018,20,10.1111/1462-2920.13960

One such habitat transition is the migration from freshwater to saltwater for anadromous fish, such as salmon. The aim of the current work was therefore to determine the freshwater-to-saltwater transition impact on the gut microbiota in farmed Atlantic salmon, with dietary interventions resembling freshwater and saltwater diets with respect to fatty acid composition. Using deep 16S rRNA gene sequencing and quantitative PCR, we found that the freshwater-to-saltwater transition had a major association with the microbiota composition and quantity, while diet did not show significant associations with the microbiota. In saltwater there was a 100-fold increase in bacterial quantity, with a relative increase of Firmicutes and a relative decrease of both Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria. Irrespective of an overall shift in microbiota composition from freshwater to saltwater, we identified three core clostridia and one Lactobacillus-affiliated phylotype with wide geographic distribution that were highly prevalent and co-occurring. Taken together, our results support the importance of the dominating bacteria in the salmon gut, with the freshwater microbiota being immature. Due to the low number of potentially host-associated bacterial species in the salmon gut, we believe that farmed salmon can represent an important model for future understanding of host-bacterium interactions in aquatic environments. IMPORTANCE Little is known about factors affecting the interindividual distribution of gut bacteria in aquatic environments. We have shown that there is a core of four highly prevalent and co-occurring bacteria irrespective of feed and freshwater-to-saltwater transition.

Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) reintroduction efforts into Lake Ontario, Canada, have been unsuccessful, likely due to competition with non-native salmonids. In this study, we explored interspecific competition effects on the gut microbiota of two Atlantic salmon populations (LaHave and Sebago) resulting from four non-native salmonids. After 10 months of rearing in semi-natural stream tanks under six interspecific competition treatments, we characterized the gut microbiota of 178 Atlantic salmon by parallel sequencing the 16S rRNA gene. We found 3978 bacterial OTUs across all samples. Microbiota alpha diversity and abundance of 27 OTUs significantly differed between the two populations. Interspecific competition reduced relative abundance of potential beneficial bacteria (six genera of lactic acid bacteria) as well as 13 OTUs, but only in the LaHave population, indicating population-specific competition effects. The pattern of gut microbiota response to interspecific competition may reflect local adaptation of the host-microbiota interactions and can be used to select candidate populations for improved species reintroduction success.",2018,75,10.1007/s00248-017-1035-6

We investigated the spatial and temporal distributions of ciliate species across the intertidal environment at sites in Maine and Connecticut, USA. Our study used a DNA fingerprinting technique, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), which allows for genetic analyses of abundant community members. We investigated how ciliate diversity changed across several spatiotemporal scales: (1) between the open ocean and tide pools, (2) among different tide pools at varying distances from the low tide mark and (3) at differing times within a tidal cycle. In addition, we examined the differences between active and non-active members in these extreme environments by investigating diversity of both ribosomal DNA and RNA. In both Maine and Connecticut, we found abundant ciliate taxa that are either rare or absent in the open ocean, and that appear to quickly dominate tide pools once they are isolated from the open ocean.

Herein, thirty publically-available metagenomes from 11 globally distributed ecosystems were selected. These metagenomes were clustered by biome (i.e. forest, grasslands, tundra, semiarid and desert) based on morphoclimatic features. Protein biosynthesis, central carbohydrate metabolism, and antibiotic resistance were the most statistically different SEED subsystems among biome groups. CAZy-based annotation revealed that genes related to biomass degradation, sucrose and starch metabolism, and cell wall biosynthesis were overrepresented in forest and grasslands soils. As expected, desiccation and other stress resistance genes were prevalent in desert and semiarid soils. Antibiotic Resistance Genes (ARGs) were more abundant in forest and grassland soils, and multidrug efflux pumps were the most abundant ARG class. Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs) were generally more abundant in tundra, semiarid and desert. However, HSP60 and HSP20, predominantly from Archaea, were enriched in the Saline Desert soils.

We mapped compositional variation (i.e., beta-diversity) in the gut microbiotas of 136 pairs of wild mammalian species living throughout the Americas to assess how the distribution of mammals across geographic space influences the diversification of their gut bacteria. Comparing the gut microbiotas of sympatric and allopatric mammalian populations provided insights into the flow of gut bacteria within and between mammalian communities, revealing that spatial limits on bacterial dispersal promote beta-diversity between the gut microbiotas of mammalian species. Each geographic locale displayed a unique gutmicrobiota composition that could not be fully explained by the diets and phylogenetic histories of the resident mammalian hosts, indicating that some gut bacteria are geographically restricted. Across the western hemisphere, the compositional overlap between the gut microbiotas of allopatric mammalian populations decayed exponentially with the geographic distance separating the hosts. The relationship between geographic distances among hosts and compositional differences among their gut microbiotas was independent of dietary and phylogenetic divergence among hosts. Within mammalian communities, we observed widespread sharing of gut bacteria between predator-prey host-species pairs, indicating horizontal transfer of gut bacteria through mammalian food chains. Collectively, these results indicate that compositional differences between the gut microbiotas of mammalian taxa are generated and maintained by limits to bacterial dispersal imposed by physical distance between hosts.",2017,114,10.1073/pnas.1700122114

To fill this gap, we conducted a comprehensive study of gut microbiota of a well-studied North American red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) population. Red squirrels are territorial, solitary, and live in a highly seasonal environment and therefore represent a very attractive system to study factors that drive the temporal and spatial dynamics of gut microbiota. Result: For the first time, this study revealed significant spatial patterns of gut microbiota within a host population, suggesting limited dispersal could play a role in shaping and maintaining the structure of gut microbial communities. We also found a remarkable seasonal rhythm in red squirrels gut microbial composition manifested by a tradeoff between relative abundance of two genera Oscillospira and Corpococcus and clearly associated with seasonal variation in diet availability. Our results show that in nature, environmental factors exert a much stronger influence on gut microbiota than host-associated factors including age and sex. Despite strong environmental effects, we found clear evidence of individuality and maternal effects, but host genetics did not seem to be a significant driver of the gut microbial communities in red squirrels. Conclusion: Taken together, the results of this study emphasize the importance of external ecological factors rather than host attributes in driving temporal and spatial patterns of gut microbiota in natural environment.",2017,5,10.1186/s40168-017-0382-3

Knowledge about the diversity and distribution patterns as well as drivers of microbial eukaryote (including ciliates) along the water column, particularly below the photic zone, is scarce. In this study, we investigated the diversity of pelagic ciliates, the main group of marine microeukaryotes, their vertical distribution from the surface to the abyssopelagic zone, as well as their horizontal distribution over a distance of 1,300 km in the Western Pacific Ocean, using high-throughput DNA and cDNA (complementary DNA) sequencing. No distance-decay relationship could be detected along the horizontal scale; instead, a distinct vertical distribution within the ciliate communities was revealed. The alpha diversity of the ciliate communities in the deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) and the 200 m layer turned out to be significantly higher compared with the other water layers. The ciliate communities in the 200 m water layer appeared to be more similar to those in deeper layers from 1,000 m to about 5,000 m than to the surface and DCM ciliate communities. Dominant species in the bathypelagic and abyssopelagic zone, particularly some parasites, were also detected in the 200 m layer, but were almost absent in the surface layer. The 200 m layer, therefore, seems to be an important species bank for deep ocean layers. Statistical analyses further revealed significant effects of temperature and chlorophyll a on the partitioning of ciliate diversity, indicating that environmental factors are a stronger force in shaping marine pelagic ciliate communities than the geographic distance.",2017,8,10.3389/fmicb.2017.02559

Lowest cell numbers were counted at the edge of the south Pacific gyre and within the north Pacific gyre followed by an increase to the north with maximum values in the highly productive Bering Sea. Specific quantification of the Roseobacter group revealed on average a relative abundance of 1.7 and 6.3% as determined by catalyzed reported deposition-fluorescence in situ hybridization (CARD-FISH) and quantitative PCR (qPCR), respectively. Corresponding Illumina tag sequencing of 16S rRNA genes and 16S rRNA transcripts showed different compositions containing on average 0.7 and 0.9% Roseobacter-affiliated OTUs of the DNA- and RNA-based communities. These OTUs were mainly assigned to uncultured members of the Roseobacter group. Among those with cultured representatives, Sedimentitalea and Sulfitobacter made up the largest proportions. The different oceanic provinces with low nutrient content such as both ocean gyres were characterized by specific communities of the Roseobacter group, distinct from those of the more productive Pacific subarctic region and the Bering Sea. However, linking the community structure to specific metabolic processes at the seafloor is hampered by the dominance of so-far uncultured members of the Roseobacter group, indicating a diversity that has yet to be explored.",2017,8,10.3389/fmicb.2017.02550

Modern advances in sequencing technology have enabled the census of microbial members of many natural ecosystems. Recently, attention is increasingly being paid to the microbial residents of human-made, built ecosystems, both private (homes) and public (subways, office buildings, and hospitals). Here, we report results of the characterization of the microbial ecology of a singular built environment, the International Space Station (ISS). This ISS sampling involved the collection and microbial analysis (via 16S rDNA PCR) of 15 surfaces sampled by swabs onboard the ISS. This sampling was a component of Project MERCCURI (Microbial Ecology Research Combining Citizen and University Researchers on ISS). Learning more about the microbial inhabitants of the buildings in which we travel through space will take on increasing importance as plans for human exploration continue with the possibility of colonization of other planets and moons. Results. Sterile swabs were used to sample 15 surfaces onboard the ISS. The sites sampled were designed to be analogous to samples collected for (1) the Wildlife of Our Homes project and (2) a study of cell phones and shoes that were concurrently being collected for another component of Project MERCCURL Sequencing of the 16S rDNA genes amplified from DNA extracted from each swab was used to produce a census of the microbes present on each surface sampled. We compared the microbes found on the ISS swabs to those from both homes on Earth and data from the Human Microbiome Project. Conclusions. While significantly different from homes on Earth and the Human Microbiome Project samples analyzed here, the microbial community composition on the ISS was more similar to home surfaces than to the human microbiome samples. The ISS surfaces are species-rich with 1,036-4,294 operational taxonomic units (OTUs per sample). There was although this may be a no discernible biogeography of microbes on the 15 ISS surfaces, reflection of the small sample size we were able to obtain.",2017,5,10.7717/peerj.4029

Equipped with high-throughput methods for studying the taxonomic and functional characteristics of diverse samples, they are just beginning to encounter the conceptual, theoretical, and experimental problems of comparing taxonomy to (micro-ecological) function, and extracting useful measures from such comparisons (i.e. diversity, stability, or health). Although still unresolved, these problems are well studied in macro-ecology (the ecology of non-microbes) and are reiterated here as an historical precautionary for microbial ecologists. Beyond expected and unresolved terminological vagueness, we argue that assessments and comparisons of taxonomic and functional profiles in micro-ecology suffer from theoretically unresolvable arbitrariness and ambiguities. We divide these into problems of scale, individuation, and commensurability. We argue that there is no technically/theoretically correct scale, individuation, or comparison of taxonomy and function, but there are nonetheless better and worse methodologies for profiling.",2017,32,10.1007/s10539-017-9602-2

However, we still lack an understanding of how these communities are organized across GIT in natural environments. Here, using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we analyzed the bacterial community diversity, network interactions and ecosystem stability across five gut regions (mouth, stomach, small intestine, cecum and colon) emanating from two common pika species in China, including Plateau pikas (Ochotona curzoniae) inhabiting high-altitude regions, as well as Daurian pikas (O. daurica) occupying low-altitude areas. The relative abundances of dominant Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes exhibited an increasing trend from mouth to colon. Cecum and colon harbored higher bacterial diversity compared with other anatomical regions. Gut region significantly influenced the structure of bacterial communities in the GIT. Network analysis indicated that topological features showed marked variations among gut regions. Interestingly, the ecosystem stability of bacterial communities increased gradually from mouth to colon. Our results suggest that gut region influences the diversity, structure and network interactions of bacterial communities in pikas. For hindgut-fermenting herbivorous mammals, relatively higher bacterial diversity and ecosystem stability in the cecum may provide a favorable condition for the fermentation of indigestible plant polysaccharides.",2017,93,10.1093/femsec/fix149

Here, we undertook a proof-of-principle metaproteogenomic investigation on luminal and mucosal samples collected from 10 GITs of a 30-day-old pre-weaned lamb. We demonstrate that the analysis of the diverse ecological niches along the GITs can reveal microbiota composition and metabolic functions, although low amounts of microbial proteins could be identified in the small intestinal and mucosal samples. Our data suggest that a 30-day lamb has already developed mature microbial functions in the forestomachs, while the effect of the milky diet appears to be more evident in the remaining GITs. We also report the distribution and the relative abundance of the host functions, active at the GIT level, with a special focus on those involved in digestive processes.

Data were collected on two cruises, one in November 2012, and one in May 2013. Special focus was on the impact of advective processes and how these are reflected in the autochthonous and allochthonous fractions of the bacterial communities. Both in November and May bacterial community composition, determined by Automated Ribosomal Intergenic Spacer Analyses (ARISA), in the surface and intermediate water appeared to be highly related to bacterial communities originating from freshwater runoff and coastal water, whereas the sources in the basin water were mostly unknown. Additionally, the inner part of the Sognefjord was more influenced by side-fjords than the outer part, and changes in bacterial community structure along the coast-fjord gradient generally showed higher correlation with environmental variables than with geographic distances. High resolution model simulations indicated a surprisingly high degree of temporal and spatial variation in both current speed and direction. This led to a more episodic/discontinuous horizontal current pattern, with several vortices (10-20 km wide) being formed from time to time along the fjord. We conclude that during periods of strong wind forcing, advection led to allochthonous species being introduced to the surface and intermediate layers of the fjord, and also appeared to homogenize community composition in the basin water. We also expect vortices to be active mixing zones where inflowing bacterial populations on the southern side of the fjord are mixed with the outflowing populations on the northern side. On average, retention time of the fjord water was sufficient for bacterial communities to be established.",2017,159,10.1016/j.pocean.2017.09.002

In this study, we compared the microbial community composition of leaves and berries of a grape variety (Carmenere) from six different Chilean vineyards within 35 km of each other. In order to determine relationships between spatial proximity and microbial compositional dissimilarity, we sequenced amplicons of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region for fungi and 16S rRNA gene for bacteria. Results showed that both the fungal and the bacterial community compositions of the studied vineyards differed, but this difference was much clearer in fungi than in bacteria. In addition, while bacterial community dissimilarity was not correlated with geographic distance, the leaf and berry fungal community dissimilarities between locations increased with geographic distance. This indicates that spatial processes play an important role in structuring the biogeographic pattern of grape-associated fungal communities at local scales, which might in turn contribute to the local identity of wine.",2017,9,10.1111/1758-2229.12589

We compared our dataset to a library of nirS sequences obtained previously from the same samples by standard PCR cloning and Sanger sequencing, and showed that both methods similarly demonstrated geography, salinity and, to a lesser extent, nitrogen, to be strong determinants of community composition. Furthermore, the depth afforded by NGS enabled novel techniques for measuring the association between environment and community composition. We used Random Forests modelling to demonstrate that the site and salinity of a sample could be predicted from its nirS sequences, and to identify indicator taxa associated with those environmental characteristics.

We tested the algal SAR in lakes, pools and ponds of various sizes (10(-2)-10(8)m(2)) and similar hydromorphological and trophic characteristics using species-specific data and functional groups. Besides the expectation that species richness increases monotonously with area, we found a right-skewed hump-shaped relationship between the area and phytoplankton species richness. Functional richness however did not show such distortion. Differences between the area dependence of species and functional richness indicate that functional redundancy is responsible for the unusual hump-backed SAR. We demonstrated that the Small Island Effect, which is a characteristic for macroscopic SARs can also be observed for the phytoplankton. Our results imply a so-called large lake effect, which means that in case of large lakes, wind-induced mixing acts strongly against the habitat diversity and development of phytoplankton patchiness and finally results in lower phytoplankton species richness in the pelagial. High functional redundancy of the groups that prefer small-scale heterogeneity of the habitats is responsible for the unusual humpback relationship. The results lead us to conclude that although the mechanisms that regulate the richness of both microbial communities and communities of macroscopic organisms are similar, their importance can be different in micro- and macroscales.",2017,7,10.1002/ece3.3512

The collected profiles revealed the presence of 89 putative novel bifidobacterial taxa in addition to 45 previously described species. Remarkably, in contrast to what is currently known for many gut commensals, we did not observe host-specialization among bifidobacterial species but rather their widespread distribution across mammals. Moreover, ITS rRNA profiling of wild relatives of domesticated dogs, rabbits and pigs clearly indicates that domestication and close contact with humans have impacted on the composition of the fecal bifidobacterial population. These data were complemented by analysis of bifidobacterial communities in milk of eight mammalian families, showing that bifidobacteria represent prototypical early gut microbiota members which are inherited by newborns from their lactating mother.

As crucial moderators of geochemical cycling processes and pollutant remediation, soil microbes may be affected by these contaminants. We collected soil samples heavily contaminated by e-waste recycling in China and Pakistan, and analyzed the indigenous microbial communities. The results of this work revealed that the microbial community composition and diversity, at both whole and core community levels, were affected significantly by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and heavy metals (e.g., Cu, Zn, and Pb). The geographical distance showed limited impacts on microbial communities compared with geochemical factors. The constructed ecological network of soil microbial communities illustrated microbial co-occurrence, competition and antagonism across soils, revealing the response of microbes to soil properties and pollutants. Two of the three main modules constructed with core operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were sensitive to nutrition (total organic carbon and total nitrogen) and pollutants.

Biogeographical regionalization has been demonstrated for many higher taxa, such as terrestrial plants and vertebrates, but not in microbial communities. Therefore, we sought to test empirically whether microbial communities, or taxa, showpatterns consistent with biogeographical regionalization. Location: Within halite (NaCl) crystals from coastal solar salterns of western Europe, the Mediterranean and east Africa. Time period: Modern (2006-2013). Major taxa studied: Archaea. Methods: Using high-throughput Illumina amplicon sequencing, we generated the most high-resolution characterization of halite-associated archaeal communities to date, using samples from 17 locations. We grouped communities into biogeographical clusters based on community turnover to test whether these communities show biogeographical regionalization. To examine whether individual taxa, rather than communities, show biogeographical patterns, we also tested whether the relative abundance of individual genera may be indicative of a communitys biogeographical origins using machine learning methods, specifically random forest classification. Results: We found that the rate of community turnover was greatest over subregional spatial scales (< 500 km), whereas at regional spatial scales the turnover was independent of geographical distance. Biogeographical clusters of communities were either not statistically robust or lacked spatial coherence, inconsistent with biogeographical regionalization. However, we identified several archaeal genera that were good indicators of biogeographical origin, providing classification error rates of <10%. Main conclusions: Overall, our results provide little support for the concept of biogeographical regions in these extremophilic microbial communities, despite the fact that some taxa do show biogeographical patterns. We suggest that variable dispersal ability among the halite-associated Archaea may disrupt biogeographical patterns at the community level, preventing the formation of biogeographical regions. This means that the processes that lead to the formation of biogeographical regions operate differentially on individual microbial taxa rather than on entire communities.",2017,26,10.1111/geb.12670

ResultsThe cyanobacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences were grouped into 20 operational taxonomic units (OTUs), and the six major OTUs that accounted for 88% of sequences were distributed broadly from polar to Asian glaciers, suggesting that they are cosmopolitan at the species level. However, analysis of the more variable ITS region revealed geographical differentiation at the strain level. Nineteen OTUs, including the six major OTUs, showed considerable genetic differentiation among geographical regions; at the population level, they are, thus, geographically restricted. Only one of the phylotype exhibits a population structure which does not show a relationship with geographical distribution, suggesting that is cosmopolitan, even at the strain level. Main conclusionsOur 16S rRNA gene analyses suggest a global distribution of species of cyanobacteria colonizing glacier surfaces; however, the 16S-23S ITS regions revealed that most of the phylotypes are fundamentally endemic to particular areas at the population level and indicate limited migration among regions.

The establishment and interactive development of this early gut microbiota are believed to be (at least partially) driven and modulated by specific compounds present in human milk. It has been shown that certain genomes of infant gut commensals, in particular those of bifidobacterial species, are genetically adapted to utilize specific glycans of this human secretory fluid, thus representing a very intriguing example of host-microbe coevolution, where both partners are believed to benefit. In recent years, various metagenomic studies have tried to dissect the composition and functionality of the infant gut microbiome and to explore the distribution across the different ecological niches of the infant gut biogeography of the corresponding microbial consortia, including those corresponding to bacteria and viruses, in healthy and ill subjects. Such analyses have linked certain features of the microbiota/microbiome, such as reduced diversity or aberrant composition, to intestinal illnesses in infants or disease states that are manifested at later stages of life, including asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, and metabolic disorders.

However, our knowledge of patterns and drivers of permafrost microbial communities is limited over broad geographic scales. Using high-throughput Illumina sequencing, this study compared soil bacterial, archaeal and fungal communities between the active and permafrost layers on the Tibetan Plateau. Our results indicated that microbial alpha diversity was significantly higher in the active layer than in the permafrost layer with the exception of fungal Shannon-Wiener index and Simpsons diversity index, and microbial community structures were significantly different between the two layers. Our results also revealed that environmental factors such as soil fertility (soil organic carbon, dissolved organic carbon and total nitrogen contents) were the primary drivers of the beta diversity of bacterial, archaeal and fungal communities in the active layer. In contrast, environmental variables such as the mean annual precipitation and total phosphorus played dominant roles in driving the microbial beta diversity in the permafrost layer. Spatial distance was important for predicting the bacterial and archaeal beta diversity in both the active and permafrost layers, but not for fungal communities. Collectively, these results demonstrated different driving factors of microbial beta diversity between the active layer and permafrost layer, implying that the drivers of the microbial beta diversity observed in the active layer cannot be used to predict the biogeographic patterns of the microbial beta diversity in the permafrost layer.",2017,26,10.1111/mec.14396

Here, we use a natural experimental system of isolated tree islands to test whether environment or geography primarily structures fungal community composition at fine spatial scales. This system consists of isolated pairs of two distantly related, congeneric pine trees established at varying distances from each other and the forest edge, allowing us to disentangle the effects of geographic distance vs. host and edaphic environment on associated fungal communities. We identified fungal community composition with Illumina sequencing of ITS amplicons, measured all relevant environmental parameters for each tree-including tree age, size and soil chemistry-and calculated geographic distances from each tree to all others and to the nearest forest edge. We applied generalized dissimilarity modelling to test whether total and ectomycorrhizal fungal (EMF) communities were primarily structured by geographic or environmental filtering. Our results provide strong evidence that as in many other organisms, niche and neutral processes both contribute significantly to turnover in community composition in fungi, but environmental filtering plays the dominant role in structuring both free-living and symbiotic fungal communities at fine spatial scales. In our study system, we found pH and organic matter primarily drive environmental filtering in total soil fungal communities and that pH and cation exchange capacity-and, surprisingly, not host species-were the largest factors affecting EMF community composition.

Operational taxonomic unit richness decreased with increasing altitude, and the fungal communities were clustered into three groups that corresponded to altitudes of, i.e., 1600, 2300, and above 2800 m. The evenness of fungi was not significantly correlated with altitude, whereas beta diversities were significantly correlated with altitude. The distance-based redundancy analysis and Mantel test indicated that the composition of fungal assemblages was mostly driven by altitude and temperature. Our results indicated that ecological processes possibly related to altitude and temperature play an important role in structuring fungal biodiversity along the elevational gradient. Our results highlight that different microbes may respond differently to environmental gradients.",2017,17,10.1007/s11368-017-1701-9

Phylogenetic and genomic evidence indicates that N2O reducing communities can be divided into two genetically distinct groups, termed Glade I and II. Differing abundance or diversity of each Glade may have significant consequences for N2O emissions from soil. However, whether the two groups respond similarly to gradients of environmental or biotic factors in soils remains unclear. Here, we explore spatial patterns of nosZ Glade I and II abundance, phylogenetic diversity and community structure across a 44-ha farm, and compare with edaphic factors and abundances of ammonia oxidizing and denitrifying communities, which are the main N2O producers in soil. Contrasting spatial distributions of the total abundance and phylogenetic diversity of each Glade, as well as disparate associations with various edaphic and biotic factors indicated potential niche differentiation between the two clades. This is supported by the greater occurrence of significant phylogenetic clustering or overdispersion in Glade I communities compared to Glade II, indicating differences in the underlying mechanisms of community assembly for each group. Variance partitioning of phylogenetic community structure further showed that biotic factors, particularly the abundance of denitrifiers, played a more substantial role in explaining Glade II community structure compared to that of Glade I. Finally, identification of nosZ lineages driving differences in community structure and spatial distribution patterns of gene abundances suggests a shift in the genetic potential for N2O production and consumption dynamics across the farm.

Here, by characterizing both housekeeping (rpoB and 16S rRNA gene) and nodulation (nodD) genes, we explore processes shaping epidemic patterns of facultative microsymbionts from rhizosphere soils of faba bean in three ecoregions. Although total bacterial communities in rhizosphere were not significantly differentiated across ecoregions, rpoB amplicon sequencing uncovered that Rhizobium laguerreae and Rhizobium anhuiense were predominant in different samples with contrasting pH or salt content. However, R. anhuiense can outcompete R. laguerreae in certain sterilized soils where R. laguerreae originally dominated, and viceversa. Contrasting bacterial taxa associated with either R. laguerreae or R. anhuiense in soils.

Competitive nodulation experiments demonstrated a hierarchical selection on nodD genotypes and their genomic backgrounds by faba bean cultivars. Taken together, abiotic and biotic factors in soils and the selection by legume hosts are either indirectly or directly involved in shaping rhizobial species-level taxonomic biogeography, which however cannot be used to infer spatial patterns of nodulation gene.

Skin microbiome varies from person to person due to a combination of various factors, including age, biogeography, sex, cosmetics and genetics. Many skin disorders appear to be related to the resident microflora, yet databases of facial skin microbiome of many biogeographies, including Thai, are limited. Methods. Metagenomics derived B-RISA and 16S rRNA gene sequencing was utilized to identify the culture-independent bacterial diversity on Thai male faces (cheek and forehead areas). Skin samples were categorized (grouped) into (i) normal (teertage.hea) and (ii) acne-prone (teenage.acn) young adults, and normal (iii) middle-aged (middle.hea) and (iv) elderly (elderly.hea) adults. Results. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing was successful as the sequencing depth had an estimated >98% genus coverage of the true community. The major diversity was found between the young and elderly adults in both cheek and foreheadareas, followed are s, followed by that between normal and acne young adults. Detection ofrepresentative characteristics indicated that bacteria from the order Rhizobiales, genera Sphingomonas and Pseudoalteromortas, distinguished the elderly.hea microbiota, along the clinical features of wrinkles and pores. Prediction of the metabolic potential revealed reduced metabolic pathways involved in replication and repair, nucleotide metabolism and genetic translation in the elderly.hea compared with that in the. tee.nage.hea. For young adults, some unique compositions such as abundance of Proptombacteriurn ac!tes and Staphylococcus epidermidis, with a minor diversity between normal and acne skins, were detected. The metabolic potentials of the acne vs. normal young adults showed that teenage.acn was low in many cellular processes (e.g., cell motility and environmental adaptation), but high in carbohydrate metabolism, which could support acne growth. Moreover, comparison with the age-matched males from the US (Boulder, Colorado) to gain insight into the diversity, across national biogeography, revealed differ!nces in the distribution pattern of species, although common bacteria were present in both biogeographical samples. Furthermore, B-RISA served as a crosscheck result to the 16S rRNA gene sequencing (i.e., differences between teenage and elderly microbiota) Conclusions. This study revealed and compared the microbial diversity on different aged Thai male faces, and included analyses for representing the bacterial flora, the clinical skin characteristics, and comparison with the US age-matched. The results represent the first skin microbiota of Thai males, and helps the design ofalarge-scale skin microbiome study of Thais.The findings of the diversity among ages, skin type and national biogeography supported the importance of these traits in the skin microbiome and in developing a safe and sustainable treatment for acne and aging skin diseases.",2017,5,10.7717/peerj.4084

However, the diverse endophytic non-rhizobial bacteria in legume nodules that co-exist with rhizobia are often ignored because they are difficult to cultivate using routine cultivation approaches. To enhance our understanding of the incidence and diversity of legume-bacteria associations, a high-throughput sequencing analysis of bacterial 16S rRNA genes was used to examine the bacterial community in the rhizospheres and root nodules of Dalbergia odorifera seedlings that were uninoculated or inoculated with Bradyrhizobium elkanii H255, Rhizobium multihospitium-like HT221, or Burkholderia pyrrocinia-like H022238, in two growth media (nitrogen [N]-supplied soil or N-omitted potting mix). Seedlings inoculated with Bradyrhizobium had significantly more nodules than seedlings in the other inoculation conditions, regardless of growth media. Using the N-15 natural abundance method, it was shown that the inoculated plants had significantly higher N-2 fixation efficiency (48-57%) and specific nodule activity [269-313 mu g N mg(-1) of dry weight (dwt) nodule] compared to the uninoculated plants (203 mu g N mg(-1) dwt nodule). The 16S rRNA gene analysis showed that there was generally a higher bacterial diversity in the rhizosphere than in the nodules in the corresponding condition. Both rhizobial inoculation and media status significantly altered the bacterial communities in the rhizospheres and nodules (P < 0.05), with the exception of the inoculated soil rhizospheres. Regarding non-rhizobial bacteria, three genera, i.e., Lactococcus, Bacillus, and Pseudomonas, were consistently enriched in the rhizosphere and Bradyrhizobium, Chloroplast norank (which belongs to Cyanobacteria), and Lactococcus were commonly found in the nodules. In contrast, common rhizobial genera (including Rhizobium, Mesorhizobium, and Burkholderia) were only present in the nodules at low relative abundances (0.01-3.41%). Regarding non-rhizobial bacteria, 32 genera were found in the nodules, with non-rhizobial bacteria being predominant in the N omitted potting mix (with a relative abundance of 56-87%). This study suggests that legume nodules are inhabited by a high diversity of non-rhizobial bacteria, which may play a vital role in nodulation and N-2 fixation in the host plants.",2017,8,10.3389/fmicb.2017.02255

However, many of the statistical issues that plague such analyses in macroscale communities remain unresolved for microbial communities. Here, we discuss problems in the analysis of microbial species correlations based on presence-absence data. We focus on presence-absence data because this information is more readily obtainable from sequencing studies, especially for whole-genome sequencing, where abundance estimation is still in its infancy. First, we show how Pearsons correlation coefficient (r) and Jaccards index (J)-two of the most common metrics for correlation analysis of presence-absence data-can contradict each other when applied to a typical microbiome dataset. In our dataset, for example, 14% of species-pairs predicted to be significantly correlated by r were not predicted to be significantly correlated using J, while 37.4% of species-pairs predicted to be significantly correlated by J were not predicted to be significantly correlated using r. Mismatch was particularly common among species-pairs with at least one rare species (<10% prevalence), explaining why r and J might differ more strongly in microbiome datasets, where there are large numbers of rare taxa. Indeed 74% of all species-pairs in our study had at least one rare species. Next, we show how Pearsons correlation coefficient can result in artificial inflation of positive taxon relationships and how this is a particular problem for microbiome studies. We then illustrate how Jaccards index of similarity (J) can yield improvements over Pearsons correlation coefficient. However, the standard null model for Jaccards index is flawed, and thus introduces its own set of spurious conclusions. We thus identify a better null model based on a hypergeometric distribution, which appropriately corrects for species prevalence. This model is available from recent statistics literature, and can be used for evaluating the significance of any value of an empirically observed Jaccards index. The resulting simple, yet effective method for handling correlation analysis of microbial presence-absence datasets provides a robust means of testing and finding relationships and/or shared environmental responses among microbial taxa.",2017,12,10.1371/journal.pone.0187132

Marine ciliate diversity is believed to be greatest at the chlorophyll maximum, where there is an abundance of autotrophic prey, and is often assumed to decline with depth. Here, we assess the abundant (DNA) and active (RNA) marine ciliate communities throughout the water column at two stations off the New England coast (Northwest Atlantic)-a coastal station 43 km from shore (40 m depth) and a slope station 135 km off shore (1,000 m). We analyze ciliate communities using a DNA fingerprinting technique, Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE), which captures patterns of abundant community members. We compare estimates of ciliate communities from SSU-rDNA (abundant) and SSU-rRNA (active) and find complex patterns throughout the water column, including many active lineages below the photic zone. Our analyses reveal (1) a number of widely-distributed taxa that are both abundant and active; (2) considerable heterogeneity in patterns of presence/absence of taxa in offshore samples taken 50 m apart throughout the water column; and (3) three distinct ciliate assemblages based on position from shore and depth.

Detection of areas of endemism using Parsimony Analysis of Endemicity (PAE),PROCEEDINGS OF THE BIOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF WASHINGTON,"Geographical patterns in microorganisms distribution is a matter of intense debate. Following the assumption that everything is everywhere (EiE hypothesis), it is expected that microscopic animals do not have any scale spatial pattern of distribution due to high abundances, resting stages, and long-distance dispersal. Gastrotrichs are one of the most common components of the marine soft-body meiofauna. To assess the validity of EiE hypotheses on marine gastrotrichs, we applied Parsimony Analysis of Endemism (PAE) to identify areas of endemism. We used provinces of coastal and continental shelves of the world as operational units to define the distribution of 458 marine species of Gastrotricha. We found 10 areas of endemism, most of them were recorded from Europe and North America, and some areas were also consistent with the distribution of other benthic groups. An area of endemism is obtained when at least two species are perfectly congruent in their distribution. Moreover, the state of knowledge of the true species distribution is directly related to the intensity and spatial variation of the sampling effort. Thus, it is not a surprise to note that most areas of endemism are in the North Hemisphere, where gastrotrichs have been especially and longer sampled and their geographic range size is well known. On the other hand, the absence of endemism areas in South Hemisphere is related to sampling insufficiency. However, some level of endemism was found and the ubiquitous distribution of gastrotrich species is strongly questioned.",2017,130,10.2988/17-00011

While specific microbial taxa were confined to distinct regions, representing potentially endemic populations, the percentage of cosmopolitan taxa was higher in Arctic (43%) than in Antarctic samples (36%).

To compare the biogeographic patterns and its drivers of bacterial and fungal p-diversity, we collected 62 soil samples from a typical dryland region of northwest China. We assessed bacterial and fungal communities by sequencing bacterial 16S rRNA gene and fungal ITS data. Meanwhile, the beta-diversity was decomposed into two components: species replacement (species turnover) and nestedness to further explore the bacterial and fungal beta-diversity patterns and its causes. The results show that both bacterial and fungal beta-diversity were derived almost entirely from species turnover rather than from species nestedness. Distance-decay relationships confirmed that the geographic patterns of bacterial and fungal beta-diversity were significantly different. Environmental factors had the dominant influence on both the bacterial and fungal beta-diversity and species turnover, however, the role of geographic distance varied across bacterial and fungal communities. Furthermore, both bacterial and fungal nestedness did not significantly respond to the environmental and geographic distance. Our findings suggest that the different response of bacterial and fungal species turnover to dispersal limitation and other, unknown processes may result in different biogeographic patterns of bacterial and fungal beta-diversity in the drylands of northwest China. Together, we highlight that the drivers of beta-diversity patterns vary between bacterial and fungal communities, and microbial beta-diversity are driven by multiple factors in the drylands of northwest China.",2017,8,10.3389/fmicb.2017.02126

This bacterial distribution pattern was also positively correlated with soil-quality parameters such as organic C, water-stable aggregates, porosity, moisture, and acidity. In addition, at a lower taxonomic level, the abundance of Acidobacteria Gp4, Armatimonadetes_gp4, Solirubrobacter, Microvirga, Terrimonas, and Nocardioides paralleled soil development and quality.

We characterize genome-wide methylation and highlight conserved motifs across three Trichodesmium isolates and two Trichodesmium metagenomes, thereby identifying highly conserved, novel genomic signatures of potential gene regulation in Trichodesmium. Certain gene bodies with the highest methylation levels correlate with lower expression levels. Several methylated motifs were highly conserved across spatiotemporally separated Trichodesmium isolates, thereby elucidating biogeographically conserved methylation potential. These motifs were also highly conserved in Trichodesmium metagenomic samples from natural populations suggesting them to be potential in situ markers of m5C methylation. Using these data, we highlight predicted roles of cytosine methylation in global cellular metabolism providing evidence for a core m5C methylome spanning different ocean regions.

Most predictive models use only environmental parameters, although a long history of ecological literature suggests that community complexity should also be an informative parameter. Thus, we hypothesize that incorporating information about a communitys complexity might improve predictive power in microbial models. Here, we present a new metric, called community cohesion, that quantifies the degree of connectivity of a microbial community. We analyze six long-term (10 years) microbial data sets using the cohesion metrics and validate our approach using data sets where absolute abundances of taxa are available. As a case study of our metrics utility, we show that community cohesion is a strong predictor of Bray-Curtis dissimilarity (R-2 = 0.47) between phytoplankton communities in Lake Mendota, WI, USA. Our cohesion metrics outperform a model built using all available environmental data collected during a long-term sampling program. The result that cohesion corresponds strongly to Bray-Curtis dissimilarity is consistent across the six long-term time series, including five phytoplankton data sets and one bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing data set.

A Review and Commentary,ARCHIVES OF MEDICAL RESEARCH,"Although there is a consensus that the dominant species that make up the adult micro biota remains unchanged in elderly people, it has been reported that there are significant alterations in the proportion and composition of the different taxa, leading to reduced microbiota diversity, as well as an increase of enteropathogens that may lead to chronic inflammation. The ageing of mucosal immune and motor systems also contributes to these changes. As the individual ages, there is a loss in the number of Peyers patches, an altered local capacity of T and B cell functions as well as chronic macrophage activation. Also, environment, diet, place of residence and biogeography are regulatory factors of the microbiota. Communication in the gut-brain-axis is regulated by many intermediaries including diverse metabolites of the microbiota. Microbial changes have been observed in several geriatric diseases, like Parkinsons and Alzheimers. In addition, evidence has shown that individuals with high frailty scores had a significant reduction on lactobacilli species when compared to non-frail individuals. Oral microbiota may be also especially important because of the opportunities for access to the brain through the olfactory nerve at the roof of the nose or through the abundant innervations of the oral cavity by the trigeminal and other cranial nerves. Also, there are an increasing number of reports that have suggested potential mechanisms by which the microbiota promote human health span and aging.

Samples were collected from four marine basins (The Caspian Sea, the Great Australian Bight, and the Central and Eastern Mediterranean). The concentration of bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA genes and archaeal amoA genes were assessed using qPCR. Minimum entropy decomposition was used to elucidate the fine-scale diversity of Thaumarchaeotes. We demonstrated that there were significant differences in the abundance and diversity of Thaumarchaeotes between these four basins. The diversity of Thaumarchaeotal oligotypes differed between basins with many oligotypes only present in one of the four basins, which suggests that their distribution showed biogeographic patterning. There were also significant differences in Thaumarchaeotal community structure between these basins. This would suggest that geographically distant, yet geochemically similar basins may house distinct Thaumarchaeaotal populations.

Analysis of highly replicated 16 S rRNA gene and ITS region pyrotag libraries and shotgun metagenomes demonstrated consistent changes in microbial communities in harvested plots that included the expansion of desiccation-and heat-tolerant organisms and decline in diversity of ectomycorrhizal fungi. However, the majority of taxa, including the most abundant and cosmopolitan groups, were unaffected by harvesting. Shifts in microbial populations that corresponded to increased temperature and soil dryness were moderated by OM retention, which also selected for sub-populations of fungal decomposers.

However, it is unclear how variation within this microdiversity influences ecologically relevant traits. Here, we employ a multifaceted approach to investigate microdiversity within the dominant leaf litter bacterium, Curtobacterium, which comprises 7.8% of the bacterial community at a grassland site undergoing global change manipulations. We use cultured bacterial isolates to interpret metagenomic data, collected in situ over 2 years, together with lab-based physiological assays to determine the extent of trait variation within this abundant OTU. The response of Curtobacterium to seasonal variability and the global change manipulations, specifically an increase in relative abundance under decreased water availability, appeared to be conserved across six Curtobacterium lineages identified at this site. Genomic and physiological analyses in the lab revealed that degradation of abundant polymeric carbohydrates within leaf litter, cellulose and xylan, is nearly universal across the genus, which may contribute to its high abundance in grassland leaf litter. However, the degree of carbohydrate utilization and temperature preference for this degradation varied greatly among clades. Overall, we find that traits within Curtobacterium are conserved at different phylogenetic depths. We speculate that similar to bacteria in marine systems, diverse microbes within this taxon may be structured in distinct ecotypes that are key to understanding Curtobacterium abundance and distribution in the environment. IMPORTANCE Despite the plummeting costs of sequencing, characterizing the fine-scale genetic diversity of a microbial community-and interpreting its functional importance-remains a challenge. Indeed, most studies, particularly studies of soil, assess community composition at a broad genetic level by classifying diversity into taxa (OTUs) defined by 16S rRNA sequence similarity. However, these classifications potentially obscure variation in traits that result in fine-scale ecological differentiation among closely related strains. Here, we investigated microdiversity in a highly diverse and poorly characterized soil system (leaf litter in a southern Californian grassland). We focused on the most abundant bacterium, Curtobacterium, which by standard methods is grouped into only one OTU. We find that the degree of carbohydrate usage and temperature preference vary within the OTU, whereas its responses to changes in precipitation are relatively uniform. These results suggest that microdiversity may be key to understanding how soil bacterial diversity is linked to ecosystem functioning.",2017,8,10.1128/mBio.01809-17

Knowledge on the abundance and diversity of human-associated archaea is extremely limited, and little is known about their function(s), their overall role in human health, or their association with parts of the human body other than the gastrointestinal tract and oral cavity. Currently, methodological issues impede the full assessment of the human archaeome, as bacteria-targeting protocols are unsuitable for characterization of the full spectrum of Archaea. The goal of this study was to establish conservative protocols based on specifically archaea-targeting, PCR-based methods to retrieve first insights into the archaeomes of the human gastrointestinal tract, lung, nose, and skin. Detection of Archaea was highly dependent on primer selection and the sequence processing pipeline used. Our results enabled us to retrieve a novel picture of the human archaeome, as we found for the first time Methanobacterium and Woesearchaeota (DPANN superphylum) to be associated with the human gastrointestinal tract and the human lung, respectively. Similar to bacteria, human-associated archaeal communities were found to group biogeographically, forming (i) the thaumarchaeal skin landscape, (ii) the (methano) euryarchaeal gastrointestinal tract, (iii) a mixed skin-gastrointestinal tract landscape for the nose, and (iv) a woesearchaeal lung landscape. On the basis of the protocols we used, we were able to detect unexpectedly high diversity of archaea associated with different body parts. IMPORTANCE In summary, our study highlights the importance of the primers and NGS data processing pipeline used to study the human archaeome. We were able to establish protocols that revealed the presence of previously undetected Archaea in all of the tissue samples investigated and to detect biogeographic patterns of the human archaeome in the gastrointestinal tract, on the skin, and for the first time in the respiratory tract, i.e., the nose and lungs. Our results are a solid basis for further investigation of the human archaeome and, in the long term, discovery of the potential role of archaea in human health and disease.",2017,8,10.1128/mBio.00824-17

Little information exists on the estimated one million small sized (1-100 mu m) heterotrophic nanoflagellates and ciliates and their taxa-area relationship. We analyzed environmental DNA from 150 geo-referenced grassland plots representing topographical and land-use ranges typical for Central Europe. High through-put barcoding allowed the identification of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at species level, with high pairwise identity to reference sequences (>= 99.7%), but also the identification of sequences at the genus (>= 97%) and class (>= 80%) taxonomic level. Species richness analyses revealed, on average, 100 genus level OTUs (332 unique individual read (UIR) and 56 class level OTUs per gram of soil sample in the mesoscale (1-1 000 km). Database shortfalls were highlighted by increased uncertain taxonomic lineages at lower resolution (>= 80% sequence identity). No single barcode occurred ubiquitously across all sites. Taxa-area relationships indicated that OTUs spread over the entire mesoscale were more similar than in the local scale and increased land-use (fertilization, mowing and grazing) promoted taxa-area separation. Only a small fraction of sequences strictly matched reference library sequences, suggesting a large protistan dark matter in soil which warrants further research. (C) 2017 Elsevier GmbH.

Testate amoebae on the Antarctic Peninsula (AP) are well-documented and variations in their population size have recently been interpreted as a proxy for microbial productivity changes in response to recent regional climate change. AP testate amoeba assemblages are dominated by a small number of globally ubiquitous taxa. We examine morphological variation in Corythion spp. across the AP, finding clear evidence supporting the presence of two morphospecies. Corythion constricta (Certes 1889) was identified on the AP for the first time and has potentially been previously misidentified. Furthermore, a southerly trend of decreasing average test size in Corythion dubium (Taranek 1881) along the AP suggests adaptive polymorphism, although the precise drivers of this remain unclear, with analysis hindered by limited environmental data. Further work into morphological variation in Corythion is needed elsewhere, alongside molecular analyses, to evaluate the potential for (pseudo)cryptic diversity within the genus. We advocate a parsimonious taxonomical approach that recognises genetic diversity but also examines and develops accurate morphological divisions and descriptions suitable for light microscopy-based ecological and palaeoecological studies.

Few investigations have been reported on spatial variation of microbial community composition in response to fertilizations in agroecosystems at a large scale. To improve the related understandings, we have evaluated the taxonomic and phylogenetic diversities of bacterial taxa in response to three fertilization strategies in six paddy experiment sites spanning across subtropical China. We found the large-scale compositional variation of paddy bacterial community is shaped by both geographic location and environmental selection, and the former is the dominant factor. The slopes of distance-decay relationships (DDR) are flattened by fertilizations, NPK (mineral NPK fertilizers) and OM (mineral NPK fertilizers plus organic amendments) when compared to Control. A flattened DDR implies that bacterial community composition is greatly homogenized by fertilizations in paddies. It is also inferred that fertilization decreases sensitivity of bacterial community to geographic and environmental factors, which is speculated to be beneficial for agroecosystem stability and yield sustainability. Results from this investigation correlate microscopic agroecosystem with macroscopic agricultural practices. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2017,114,10.1016/j.soilbio.2017.07.013

The specificity of rhizobia-legume associations means that underused legume species may depend on seed inoculation with their rhizobial partners. For black medic (Medicago lupulina) and lucerne (Medicago sativa) little is known about the natural prevalence of their rhizobial partner Ensifer meliloti in UK soils, so that the need for inoculating them is unclear. We analysed the site-dependence of rhizobial seed inoculation effects on the subsequent ability of rhizobial communities to form symbioses with four legume species (Medicago lupulina, M. sativa, Trifolium repens and T. pratense). At ten organic farms across the UK, a species-diverse legume based mixture (LBM) which included these four species was grown. The LBM seed was inoculated with a mix of commercial inocula specific for clover and lucerne. At each site, soil from the LBM treatment was compared to the soil sampled prior to the sowing of the LBM (the control). From each site and each of the two treatments, a suspension of soils was applied to seedlings of the four legume species and grown in axenic conditions for six weeks. Root nodules were counted and their rhizobia isolated. PCR and sequencing of a fragment of the gyrB gene from rhizobial isolates allowed identification of strains. The number of nodules on each of the four legume species was significantly increased when inoculated with soil from the LBM treatment compared to the control. Both the proportion of plants forming nodules and the number of nodules formed varied significantly by site, with sites significantly affecting the Medicago species but not the Trifolium species. These differences in nodulation were broadly reflected in plant biomass where site and treatment interacted; at some sites there was a significant advantage from inoculation with the commercial inoculum but not at others. In particular, this study has demonstrated the commercial merit of inoculation of lucerne with compatible rhizobia.",2017,120,10.1016/j.apsoil.2017.06.030

As their key survival strategies, some microbes adapt to broad ranges of environments, while others specialize to certain habitats. While ecological roles and properties of such generalists and specialists had been examined in individual ecosystems, general principles that govern their distribution patterns and evolutionary processes have not been characterized. Here, we thoroughly identified microbial generalists and specialists across 61 environments via meta-analysis of community sequencing data sets and reconstructed their evolutionary histories across diverse microbial groups. This revealed that generalist lineages possess 19-fold higher speciation rates and significant persistence advantage over specialists. Yet, we also detected three-fold more frequent generalist-to-specialist transformations than the reverse transformations. These results support a model of microbial evolution in which generalists play key roles in introducing new species and maintaining taxonomic diversity.",2017,8,10.1038/s41467-017-01265-1

An increasing amount of taxonomic data on soil microbial community composition along elevation gradients have been collected, however the trophic patterns and environmental drivers of elevational changes remain largely unclear. Here, we examined the distribution patterns of major soil bacterial and fungal taxa along the northern slope of Changbai Mountain, Northeast China, at five typical vegetation types located between 740 and 2,691 m above sea level. Elevational patterns of the relative abundance of specific microbial taxa could be partially explained by the oligotrophic-copiotrophic theory. Specifically, two dark-coniferous forests, located at mid-elevation sites, were considered to be oligotrophic habitats, with relatively higher soil C/N ratio and NH4+N concentrations. As expected, oligotrophic microbial taxa, belonging to the bacterial phyla Acidobacteria and Gemmatimonadetes, and fungal phylum Basidiomycota, were predominant in the two dark-coniferous forests, exhibiting a mid-elevation maximum pattern. In contrast, the broad leaf-Korean pine mixed forest located at the foot of the mountain, Betula ermanii-dominated forest located below the tree line, and alpine tundra at the highest elevation were considered more copiotrophic habitats, characterized by higher substrate-induced-respiration rates and NO3--N concentrations. Microbial taxa considered to be so called copiotrophic members, such as bacterial phyla Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria, and fungal phylum Ascomycota, were relatively abundant in these locations, resulting in a mid-elevation minimum pattern. At finer taxonomic levels, the two most abundant proteobacterial classes, alpha-and beta-Proteobacteria, along with Acidobacteria Gp1, 2, 3, 15, and the Basidiomycotal class of Tremellomycetes were classified with the copiotrophic group. Gamma-and delta-Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria Gp4, 6, 7, 16, and Basidiomycotal class of Agaricomycetes were classified as oligotrophic taxa. This work uses the oligotrophic-copiotrophic theory to explain the elevational distribution pattern of the relative abundance of specific microbial taxa, confirming some of the existing trophic classifications of microbial taxa and expanding on the theory to include a broader range of taxonomic levels.",2017,8,10.3389/fmicb.2017.02071

These interactions are thought to influence microbial succession, community stability, syntrophic relationships, and resiliency in the face of perturbations. The complexity and dynamism of the gut microbiota pose considerable challenges for quantitative analysis of its spatial organization. Here, we illustrate an approach for addressing this challenge, using (i) a model, defined 15-member consortium of phylogenetically diverse, sequenced human gut bacterial strains introduced into adult gnotobiotic mice fed a polysaccharide-rich diet, and (ii) in situ hybridization and spectral imaging analysis methods that allow simultaneous detection of multiple bacterial strains at multiple spatial scales. Differences in the binding affinities of strains for substrates such as mucus or food particles, combined with more rapid replication in a preferred microhabitat, could, in principle, lead to localized clonally expanded aggregates composed of one or a few taxa. However, our results reveal a colonic community that is mixed at micrometer scales, with distinct spatial distributions of some taxa relative to one another, notably at the border between the mucosa and the lumen. Our data suggest that lumen and mucosa in the proximal colon should be conceptualized not as stratified compartments but as components of an incompletely mixed bioreactor. Employing the experimental approaches described should allow direct tests of whether and how specified host and microbial factors influence the nature and functional contributions of microscale mixing to the dynamic operations of the microbiota in health and disease.",2017,114,10.1073/pnas.1711596114

Next generation sequencing reveals a bacterial community profile that is distinct among BSCs in the southwestern United States. Distribution of major phyla in the BSC topsoils included Cyanobacteria (33 � 8%), Proteobacteria (26 � 6%), and Chloroflexi (12 � 4%), with Phormidium being the numerically dominant genus. Furthermore, BSC subsurfaces contained Proteobacteria (23 � 5%), Actinobacteria (20 � 5%), and Chloroflexi (18 � 3%), with an unidentified genus from Chloroflexi (AKIW781, order) being numerically dominant. Across the transect, changes in distribution at the phylum (p < 0.0439) and genus (p < 0.006) levels, including multiple biochemical and geochemical trends (p < 0.05), positively correlated with increasing BSC surface coverage. This included increases in (a) Chloroflexi abundance, (b) abundance and diversity of Cyanobacteria, (b) OTU- level diversity in the topsoil, (c) OTU-level differentiation between the topsoil and subsurface, (d) intracellular ATP abundances and catalase activities, and (e) enrichments in clay, silt, and varying elements, including S, Mn, Co, As, and Pb, in the BSC topsoils. In sum, these studies suggest that BSCs from regions of differing surface coverage represent early successional stages, which exhibit increasing bacterial diversity, metabolic activities, and capacity to restructure the soil.

Yet, the role of the environment, including biotic forces such as microbial and insect communities, in contributing to crop phenotypes under domestication and diversification has been poorly explored. In particular, there has been limited progress in understanding how human selection, agricultural cultivation (soil disturbance, fertilization, and irrigation), and biotic forces act as selective pressures on crop phenotypes. For example, geographically-structured pathogenic, pestiferous, and mutualistic interactions with crop plants have likely given rise to landraces that interact differently with local microbial and insect communities. In order to understand the adaptive role of crop traits, we argue that more studies should be conducted in the geographic centers of origin to test hypotheses on how abiotic, biotic, and human selective forces have shaped the phenotypes of domesticated plants during crop domestication and subsequent diversification into landraces. In these centers of origin, locally endemic species associated with wild ancestors have likely contributed to the selection on plant phenotypes. We address a range of questions that can only be studied in the geographic center of crop origin, placing emphasis on Mesoamerican polyculture systems, and highlight the significance of in situ studies for increasing the sustainability of modern agricultural systems.",2017,5,10.3389/fevo.2017.00125
"Hoetzinger, M; Hahn, MW",Genomic divergence and cohesion in a species of pelagic freshwater bacteria,BMC GENOMICS,"Background: In many prokaryotic genera a clustered phylogeny is observed, akin to the occurrence of species in sexually reproducing organisms. For some taxa, homologous recombination has been invoked as the underlying mechanism providing genomic cohesion among conspecific individuals. Whether this mechanism is applicable to prokaryotes in freshwaters with low habitat connectivity - i.e. elevated geographic barriers to gene flow - is unclear. To investigate further we studied genomic trends within the globally abundant PnecC cluster (genus Polynucleobacter, Betaproteobacteria) and analyzed homologous recombination within the affiliated species P. asymbioticus. Results: Comparisons among 20 PnecC genomes revealed a clearly discontinuous distribution of nucleotide sequence similarities. Among the nine conspecific individuals (P. asymbioticus) all average nucleotide identity (ANI) values were greater than 97%, whereas all other comparisons exhibited ANI values lower than 85%. The reconstruction of recombination and mutation events for the P. asymbioticus core genomes yielded an r/m ratio of 7.4, which is clearly above estimated thresholds for recombination to act as a cohesive force. Hotspots of recombination were found to be located in the flanking regions of genomic islands. Even between geographically separated habitats a high flux of recombination was evident. While a biogeographic population structure was suggested from MLST data targeting rather conserved loci, such a structure was barely visible when whole genome data was considered. However, both MLST and whole genome data showed evidence of differentiation between two lineages of P. asymbioticus. The ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates as well as growth rates in transplantation experiments suggested that this divergence was not selectively neutral. Conclusions: The high extent of homologous recombination among P. asymbioticus bacteria can act as a cohesive force that effectively counteracts genetic divergence. At least on a regional scale, homologous recombination can act across geographically separated ecosystems and therefore plays an important role in the evolution and consistency of bacterial freshwater species. A species model akin to the biological species concept may be applicable for P. asymbioticus. Nonetheless, two genetically distinct lineages have emerged and further research may clarify if their divergence has been initiated by reinforced geographical barriers or has been evolving in sympatry.",2017,18,10.1186/s12864-017-4199-z

Little is known about the relative importance of the processes that drive planktonic and benthic microeukaryotic biogeography in subtropical offshore areas. This study compares the microeukaryotic community compositions (MCCs) from offshore waters (n = 12) and intertidal sediments (n = 12) around Xiamen Island, southern China, using high-throughput sequencing of 18S rDNA. This work further quantifies the relative contributions of spatial and environmental variables on the distribution of marine MCCs (including total, dominant, rare and conditionally rare taxa). Our results showed that planktonic and benthic MCCs were significantly different, and the benthic richness (6627 OTUs) was much higher than that for plankton (4044 OTUs) with the same sequencing effort. Further, we found that benthic MCCs exhibited a significant distance-decay relationship, whereas the planktonic communities did not. After removing two unique sites (N2 and N3), however, 72% variation in planktonic community was explained well by stochastic processes. More importantly, both the environmental and spatial factors played significant roles in influencing the biogeography of total and dominant planktonic and benthic microeukaryotic communities, although their relative effects on these community variations were different. However, a high proportion of unexplained variation in the rare taxa (78.1-97.4%) and conditionally rare taxa (49.0-81.0%) indicated that more complex mechanisms may influence the assembly of the rare subcommunity. These results demonstrate that patterns and processes in marine microeukaryotic community assembly differ among the different habitats (coastal water vs. intertidal sediment) and different communities (total, dominant, rare and conditionally rare microeukaryotes), and provide novel insight on the microeukaryotic biogeography and ecological mechanisms in coastal waters and intertidal sediments at local scale.",2017,8,10.3389/fmicb.2017.01912

Most of the work investigating microbial biogeography has been site-specific, and logical environmental factors, rather than geographical location, may be more influential on microbial diversity. SEQenv, a novel pipeline aiming to provide environmental annotations of sequences emerged to provide a consistent description of the environmental niches using the ENVO ontology. While the pipeline provides a list of environmental terms on the basis of sample datasets and, therefore, the annotations obtained are at the dataset level, it lacks a taxa centric approach to environmental annotation. The work here describes an extension developed to enhance the SEQenv pipeline, which provided the means to directly generate environmental annotations for taxa under different contexts. 16S rDNA amplicon datasets belonging to distinct biomes were selected to illustrate the applicability of the extended SEQenv pipeline. A literature survey of the results demonstrates the immense importance of sequence level environmental annotations by illustrating the distribution of both taxa across environments as well as the various environmental sources of a specific taxon. Significantly enhancing the SEQenv pipeline in the process, this information would be valuable to any biologist seeking to understand the various taxa present in the habitat and the environment they originated from, enabling a more thorough analysis of which lineages are abundant in certain habitats and the recovery of patterns in taxon distribution across different habitats and environmental gradients.",2017,5,10.7717/peerj.3827

We previously studied the bacterial communities found in households located throughout Hong Kong as well as the skin surfaces of the occupants. As a complementary study, here, we investigated the fungal communities (mycobiome) in the same residences and occupants and identified factors that are important in shaping their diversity, composition, distribution, and dispersal patterns. Results: We observed that common skin and environmental fungal taxa dominated air, surface, and skin samples. Individual and touch frequency strongly and respectively shaped the fungal community structure on occupant skin and residential surfaces. Cross-domain analysis revealed positive correlations between bacterial and fungal community diversity and composition, especially for skin samples. SourceTracker prediction suggested that some fungi can be transferred bidirectionally between surfaces and skin sites, but bacteria showed a stronger dispersal potential. In addition, we detected a modest but significant association between indoor airborne bacterial composition and geographic distance on a city-wide scale, a pattern not observed for fungi. However, the distance-decay effects were more pronounced at shorter local scale for both communities, and airflow might play a prominent role in driving the spatial variation of the indoor airborne mycobiome. Conclusions: Our study suggests that occupants exert a weaker influence on surface fungal communities compared to bacterial communities, and local environmental factors, including air currents, appear to be stronger determinants of indoor airborne mycobiome than ventilation strategy, human occupancy, and room type.",2017,5,10.1186/s40168-017-0346-7

Anthropogenic activities, including wastewater discharge and river damming, raise adverse impacts on ecosystem and continuum of rivers. An increasing amount of attention has been paid to riverine bacterioplankton as they make vital contributions to biogeochemical nutrient cycle. A comprehensive study was conducted on the bacterioplankton community along the Yarlung Tsangpo River, which is the longest plateau river in China and is suffering from various anthropogenic impacts. The results indicated that nutrient variations corresponded to anthropogenic activities, and silica, nitrogen and phosphorus were retained by the dam. River damming influenced the biomass and diversity of the bacterioplankton, but significant alterations in the community structure were not observed between upstream and downstream of the dam. Moreover, the spatial distribution of the bacterioplankton community changed gradually along the river, and the dominant bacterioplankton in the upstream, midstream and downstream portions of the river were Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria, respectively. Soluble reactive phosphorus, elevation, ammonium nitrogen, velocity and turbidity were the main environmental factors that shape the bacterioplankton community. Our study offers the first insights into the variation of a bacterioplankton community of a large river in plateau region.",2017,7,10.1038/s41598-017-12893-4

They are also of interest in the study of the function and evolution of their mitochondrion-related organelle, the hydrogenosome. The taxonomy and phylogeny of this group remains confused, due, in large part, to the fact that most of its taxa have not been characterized by modern methods including molecular sequencing. In this report we provide morphologic and molecular characterization of seven taxa from the poorly-known resurrected genus Urostomides obtained in the course of broad geographic sampling. Foissner (2016) established the family Apometopidae to include Apometopus (a junior synonym of Urostomides) and Cirranter Jankowski, 1964. These two genera differ from all other metopid genera in having a four-rowed perizonal ciliary stripe, the only currently recognizable morphologic synapomorphy for the family. The members of Urostomides show remarkable morphologic diversity. The genus has a broad geographic distribution, occurring on six continents. Urostomides species form a strongly supported clade in phylogenetic analyses. Relationships within the genus itself are less clearly resolved. The diagnoses of Apometopidae and Urostomides are emended. (C) 2017 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.",2017,61,10.1016/j.ejop.2017.07.003

We examined controls on biogeographical patterns of Aridisol prokaryotic (bacterial and archaeal) communities at a regional scale by comparing communities from 100 Aridisols throughout the southwestern United States using high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. We found that microbial communities differed among global biomes and deserts of the Southwest. Differences among biomes were driven by differences in taxonomic identities, whereas differences among deserts of the Southwest were driven by differences in relative sequence abundance. Desert communities were dominated by Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria and Crenarchaeota, supporting the notion of a core set of abundant taxa in desert soils. Our findings contrast with studies showing little taxonomic overlap at the OTU level (97% sequence similarity) across large spatial scales, as we found similar to 90% of taxa in at least two of the three deserts. Geographic distance structured prokaryotic communities indirectly through the influence of climate and soil properties. Structural equation modeling suggests that climate exerts a stronger influence than soil properties in shaping the composition of Aridisol microbial communities, with annual heat moisture index (an aridity metric) being the strongest climate driver. Annual heat moisture index was associated with decreased microbial diversity and richness. If the Desert Southwest becomes hotter and drier as predicted, these findings suggest that prokaryotic diversity and richness in Aridisols will decline.",2017,93,10.1093/femsec/fix116
"Duarte, S; Cassio, F; Pascoal, C",Environmental drivers are more important for structuring fungal decomposer communities than the geographic distance between streams,LIMNETICA,"One of the major challenges in microbial ecology is to unravel the mechanisms that operate at the spatial-temporal scales structuring microbial communities and how these communities respond to environmental change. It has been argued that the biogeography of microorganisms solely reflects the influence of contemporary environmental variation and everything is everywhere. Since the discovery of the key role that decomposer fungi, in particular aquatic hyphomycetes, play in leaf-litter decomposition in streams, mycologists were interested in deciphering several ecological aspects, including the factors that shape the distribution of these communities in streams. At local and regional scales, community structure is affected by several abiotic factors such as pH, temperature, conductivity and nutrients in the stream water, but at a global scale, community similarity also decreases as a function of the geographic distance. However, very few attempts have been conducted to assess the relative influence of environmental versus geographic factors in structuring decomposer fungi in streams. In the current study, we attempted to fulfil this lacuna by quantifying the relative contributions of environmental factors versus spatial factors to community composition, by using data of species composition and environmental (temperature, pH, conductivity and nutrient concentrations) and spatial variables (latitude, longitude and altitude), collected during a recent extensive literature search. Alfa diversity was negatively affected by pH, conductivity, nitrates and phosphorus concentrations in the stream water. On the other hand, a unimodal type relationship was found between species richness and temperature, latitude or altitude. Beta-diversity was also strongly influenced by environmental factors, in particular conductivity, nitrates and phosphorus concentrations, and pH in stream water, but also by the geographic location (latitude and longitude) of the study sites. However, when the effects were disentangled a significant effect was found only for environmental variables. This suggests that stream dwelling decomposer fungi may exhibit biogeographic patterns, but as proposed by Baas-Becking the environment selects and is in part responsible for the spatial variation of stream-dwelling decomposer fungi. However, our conclusions should be taken cautiously because our data were extracted from the literature and reflect a geographical bias in the collection effort. Thus, future investigations should involve broad-scale coordinated surveys, incorporating a larger number of streams in different latitudinal bands and along large environmental gradients, to better assess the relative importance of environmental and geographical factors in structuring fungal communities in streams.",2017,36,10.23818/limn.36.17

Compared to temperate and boreal forests, though, we have limited knowledge about the fungal diversity in tropical rainforest soils. Here we show, by environmental metabarcoding of soil samples collected in three Neotropical rainforests, that Yeasts dominate the fungal communities in terms of the number of sequencing reads and OTUs. These unicellular forms are commonly found in aquatic environments, and their hyperdiversity may be the result of frequent inundation combined with numerous aquatic microenvironments in these rainforests. Other fungi that are frequent in aquatic environments, such as the abundant Chytridiomycotina, were also detected. While there was low similarity in OTU composition within and between the three rainforests, the fungal communities in Central America were more similar to each other than the communities in South America, reflecting a general biogeographic pattern also seen in animals, plants and protists.",2017,9,10.1111/1758-2229.12575
"Duran-Riveroll, LM; Cembella, AD",Guanidinium Toxins and Their Interactions with Voltage-Gated Sodium Ion Channels,MARINE DRUGS,"Guanidinium toxins, such as saxitoxin (STX), tetrodotoxin (TTX) and their analogs, are naturally occurring alkaloids with divergent evolutionary origins and biogeographical distribution, but which share the common chemical feature of guanidinium moieties. These guanidinium groups confer high biological activity with high affinity and ion flux blockage capacity for voltage-gated sodium channels (Na-V). Members of the STX group, known collectively as paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs), are produced among three genera of marine dinoflagellates and about a dozen genera of primarily freshwater or brackish water cyanobacteria. In contrast, toxins of the TTX group occur mainly in macrozoa, particularly among puffer fish, several species of marine invertebrates and a few terrestrial amphibians. In the case of TTX and analogs, most evidence suggests that symbiotic bacteria are the origin of the toxins, although endogenous biosynthesis independent from bacteria has not been excluded. The evolutionary origin of the biosynthetic genes for STX and analogs in dinoflagellates and cyanobacteria remains elusive. These highly potent molecules have been the subject of intensive research since the latter half of the past century; first to study the mode of action of their toxigenicity, and later as tools to characterize the role and structure of Na-V channels, and finally as therapeutics. Their pharmacological activities have provided encouragement for their use as therapeutants for ion channel-related pathologies, such as pain control. The functional role in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems for both groups of toxins is unproven, although plausible mechanisms of ion channel regulation and chemical defense are often invoked. Molecular approaches and the development of improved detection methods will yield deeper understanding of their physiological and ecological roles. This knowledge will facilitate their further biotechnological exploitation and point the way towards development of pharmaceuticals and therapeutic applications.",2017,15,10.3390/md15100303

Large-scale sequencing of environmental microbiomes has the potential to shed light on the richness of bacterial biosynthetic diversity hidden in the environment, how it varies from one environment to the next, and what environmental factors correlate with changes in biosynthetic diversity. In this study, the sequencing of PCR amplicons generated using primers targeting either ketosynthase domains from polyketide biosynthesis or adenylation domains from nonribosomal peptide biosynthesis was used to assess biosynthetic domain composition and richness in soils collected across the Australian continent. Using environmental variables collected at each soil site, we looked for environmental factors that correlated with either high overall domain richness or changes in the domain composition. Among the environmental variables we measured, changes in biosynthetic domain composition correlate most closely with changes in latitude and to a lesser extent changes in pH. Although it is unclear at this time the exact mix of factors that may drive the relationship between biosynthetic domain composition and latitude, from a practical perspective the identification of a latitudinal basis for differences in soil metagenome biosynthetic domain compositions should help guide future natural product discovery efforts.",2017,114,10.1073/pnas.1710262114

However, the drivers of microbial diversity are complex and the pathways of these drivers effects are to date largely unresolved, especially in freshwaters. We disentangled the causal direct and indirect effects of climate, land cover and water chemistry on stream diatom communities using hierarchical settings. Location: Finland, a geographical gradient of c. 1200 km (60 degrees-70 degrees N). Methods: We used structural equation modelling (SEM) to analyse patterns in diatom richness, composition and the uniqueness of species composition in 143 streams. The community composition was defined as the value of the first axis in non-metric multidimensional scaling and the uniqueness of species composition of each site as its local contribution to beta diversity. Results: Species richness was mainly affected directly by energy and resource availability, increasing with nutrients but decreasing with growing degree days (GDD). The community composition was strongly influenced directly by conductivity and mainly indirectly by anthropogenic land use but also to a lesser degree by GDD (directly and indirectly), indirectly by precipitation and directly by the amount of boreal wetlands. The uniqueness of species composition increased with conductivity but decreased with nutrient concentrations with high number of unique species in southernmost and northernmost sites. Main conclusions: Our SEM analyses revealed some of the important links between climate, land cover and water chemistry, all of which influenced the microbial diversity. Energy availability has varying indirect and direct effects on diatom communities regardless of local stream conditions, whereas land cover patterns affect aquatic communities most likely indirectly through water chemistry. Collectively, these results suggest that it is important to consider environmental variables simultaneously at different hierarchically ordered scales in macroecological and biogeographical research.",2017,44,10.1111/jbi.13046

The objective of this study was to investigate AMF diversity in multiple agricultural soils (154 sites; 92 grasslands and 62 croplands) distributed over all agricultural regions in Switzerland and differing in a number of soil parameters (e.g., land use type and intensity, and altitude). We highlighted the main factors responsible for major AMF community shifts and documented specific distribution patterns for each AMF species. AMF spores were morphologically identified and counted for each species. In total, 17,924 spores were classified and 106 AMF species were identified. In general, AMF species richness (SR) was higher in grasslands than in croplands. In croplands, SR increased with altitude but this trend was not observed in grasslands. Some species occurred at virtually all sites, while others were rarely detected, and for others, species-specific distribution patterns were revealed. Some species were affected by land use type or intensity, or related factors like soil organic matter, soil microbial biomass and respiration or nutrient availability. Other species were more affected by soil pH and related parameters like base saturation and carbonate contents, by soil texture, or by altitude, or by a combination of two to several of all these parameters. We conclude that a high number of AMF species may serve as indicator species for specific habitats and land use. These species might deliver certain ecosystem services at their habitats and deserve further investigation about their functional diversity.",2017,53,10.1007/s00374-017-1217-x

Soil microbial communities play pivotal roles in many ecosystem processes and are recognized as integrative components of soil quality. Therefore, in this study, we investigated bacterial and fungal diversity in solar greenhouse soils covering a wide range of cultivation year (CY) and sampling site (SS), by using pyrosequencing technology. Surprisingly, CY and SS had little influence on bacterial and fungal relative abundance and diversity. However, environmental factors (EF) and soil available potassium (K) in particular made a significant contribution to the variation of soil bacterial and fungal communities. Specifically, K showed significant (P < 0.05) correlations with dominant bacterial phyla Bacteroidetes, Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Planctomycetes and fungal phyla Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. These results suggested that soil EF appeared more important than CY and SS in shaping the compositions of bacterial and fungal communities. In addition, since fertilizer K has been in the long-term abused in RBB-Region, future vegetable production should pay more attention to K input to reduce the negative effect on soil microbial communities.",2017,24,10.1007/s11356-017-9837-0

We identified strong connectivity within environments (up to 85.4 � 13.3% of sequences in downstream water samples sourced from upstream samples, and 44.7 � 26.6% in soil and sediment samples), but negligible connectivity across environments, which indicates that microbial dispersal was successful within but not between environments.

Regression models were used to model beta diversity as a function of different measures of abiotic environmental heterogeneity, productivity, reservoir morphology, spatial extent, and habitat heterogeneity. Our results suggest a strong relationship between beta diversity and environmental heterogeneity, productivity and spatial extent. However, contrary to our hypothesis, productivity was negatively related to beta diversity. We speculate that artificial eutrophication can lead to decreased beta diversity (biotic homogenisation).

We found that common ciliate species were more associated with environmental gradients and rare species were more related to spatial variables; however, this pattern seemed to change depending on the temporal and spatial scales considered. Environmental gradients were more important in the high waters for both common and rare species. In low waters, common species continued to be mainly driven by environmental conditions, but rare species were more associated with the spatial component, suggesting dispersal limitation likely due to differences in dispersal ability and ecological tolerance of species.

In this study, we investigated the biogeographic assemblies and ecological diversity patterns of rare and abundant bacteria in long-term oil-contaminated soils at intervals of 46-360km by performing high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA genes. The results clearly revealed distinct distribution patterns for rare and abundant bacteria in soil samples. Rare taxa were unevenly distributed; however, abundant taxa were ubiquitous across all samples. Both rare and abundant subcommunities showed significant distance-decay relationships, and their assemblies were driven by different factors. The rare subcommunity primarily exhibited a spatially structured distribution (i.e., stochastic processes), while edaphic factors (i.e., deterministic processes) largely contributed to the structure of the abundant subcommunity. A network analysis revealed closer relationships between abundant bacteria and their heightened influence on other co-occurrences in the community compared with rare species.

The ability to establish this partnership has been lost in some plant lineages like the Brassicaceae, which raises the question of what alternative nutrition strategies such plants have to grow in P-impoverished soils. To understand the contribution of plant-micro biota interactions, we studied the root-associated fungal microbiome of Arabis alpina (Brassicaceae) with the hypothesis that some of its components can promote plant P acquisition. Using amplicon sequenc ing of the fungal internal transcribed spacer 2, we studied the root and rhizosphere fungal communities of A. alpina growing under natural and controlled conditions including low-P soils and identified a set of 15 fungal taxa consistently detected in its roots.

Here, we investigated bacterial distribution in bulk soil, loosely- and tightly-bound soils, from wheat fields distributed across 800,000 km(2) of the North China Plain. Bacterial community composition differed dramatically among bulk and rhizospheric soils, and bacterial diversity decreased with the root proximity. Soil pH correlated with bacterial community composition and diversity in three compartments. Bacterial community in tightly bound soil formed a hub-based network topology with higher transitivity and greater number of central nodes compared with loosely bound and bulk soils, potentially as a result of more direct ecological interactions between the members of the tightly bound soil compartment. Bulk and rhizospheric soils maintained similar compositional distance decay patterns (with equal decay rates), but distinct phylogenetic distance decay patterns (with steeper slope of tightly bound soil). Geographical distance described a relatively greater proportion of bacterial spatial distribution in tightly bound soil, compared with loosely bound soil and bulk soil. Deterministic processes dominated the assemblage of bacterial communities in all soil compartments, while phylogenetic clustering was weaker in tightly bound soil. Taken together, our results suggest distinct bacterial network structure and distribution patterns among bulk soil, loosely bound soil and tightly bound rhizospheric soil, which could possibly result in potential functional differentiation.

Relationships between reef habitats and environmental and anthropogenic factors are assessed, and potential changes in the future distribution and persistence of habitats are considered. LocationShallow rocky and coral reefs around the Australian coast. MethodsCover of 38 sessile biota functional groups was recorded in diver-based surveys using quadrats at 1,299 sites. Classification analyses based on the functional groups were used to identify an unambiguous set of biogenic habitat types. Random forest and distance-based linear modelling were used to investigate correlations between these habitats and environmental and anthropogenic variables. ResultsCluster analyses revealed tropical and temperate realms in benthic substratum composition, each with finer-scale habitats: four for the temperate realm (canopy algae, barren, epiphytic algae-understorey and turf) and five for the tropical realm (coral, coral-bacterial mat, turf-coral, calcified algae-coral and foliose algae). Habitats were correlated with different sets of environmental and anthropogenic conditions, with key associations in the temperate realm between mean sea temperature and canopy-forming algae (negative) and barren habitat (positive). Variation in sea temperature was also an important correlate in the tropical realm. Main conclusionsQuantitative delineation of inshore reef habitats at a continental scale identifies many of the same habitat types traditionally recognized through subjective methods. Importantly, many biogenic reef habitats were closely related to environmental parameters and anthropogenic variables that are predicted to change. Consequently, habitats have differing likelihood of persistence. Structurally complex habitats in the temperate realm are at greater risk than more two-dimensional habitats (e.g., canopy-forming versus turfing algae).

These coastal lagoons are characterized by the steep environmental gradient and provide an excellent model system to decipher the biotic and abiotic factors that determine the bacterial community structure over time and space. Using Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA genes from a total of 100 bulk surface sediments, we investigated the sedimentary bacterial communities, their spatiotemporal distribution, and compared them with the rhizosphere sediment communities of a common reed; Phragmites karka and a native seagrass species; Halodule uninervis in Chilika Lagoon. Spatiotemporal patterns in bacterial communities were linked to specific biotic factors (e.g., presence and type of macrophyte) and abiotic factors (e.g., salinity) that drove the community composition. Comparative assessment of communities highlighted bacterial lineages that were responsible for segregating the sediment communities over distinct salinity regimes, seasons, locations, and presence and type of macrophytes. Several bacterial taxa were specific to one of these ecological factors suggesting that species-sorting processes drive specific biogeographical patterns in the bacterial populations. Modeling of proteobacterial lineages against salinity gradient revealed that alpha- and gamma-Proteobacteria increased with salinity, whereas beta-Proteobacteria displayed the opposite trend. The wide variety of biogeochemical functions performed by the rhizosphere microbiota of P. karka must be taken into consideration while formulating the management and conservation plan for this reed. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics and functionality of sedimentary bacterial communities and highlighted the role of biotic and abiotic factors in generating the biogeographical patterns in the bacterial communities of a tropical brackish water coastal lagoon.

By using an Illumina MiSeq sequencing analysis, we assessed the compositions and diversity of bacterial and fungal community in soils of rubber plantation (or rubber forest, RF), secondary tropical forest (STF), and tropical seasonal rainforest (TSR) in Xishuangbanna, southwest China. Our findings revealed that (a) for bacterial composition, Bacillaceae was the most dominant family (13.60%) in RF soil, while it only accounted for 4.13% in STF and 6.92% in TSR. For fungal composition, the largest family in soils of RF was Basidiomycota_unclassified. However, the largest family in STF and TSR was Russulaceae. (b) Number of operational taxonomic units, Chao index, and Shannon index of bacterial community in soil of RF were significantly higher than those of TSR and STF. However, these diversity indices of fungal community in RF were significantly lower than those of TSR and STF. (c) Soil pH and total phosphorus were very important drivers for bacterial community, whereas soil organic matter and total nitrogen were the most important factors for fungal community.

"Vander Roost, J; Thorseth, IH; Dahle, H","Microbial analysis of Zetaproteobacteria and co-colonizers of iron mats in the Troll Wall Vent Field, Arctic Mid-Ocean Ridge",PLOS ONE,"Over the last decade it has become increasingly clear that Zetaproteobacteria are widespread in hydrothermal systems and that they contribute to the biogeochemical cycling of iron in these environments. However, how chemical factors control the distribution of Zetaproteobacteria and their co-occurring taxa remains elusive. Here we analysed iron mats from the Troll Wall Vent Field (TWVF) located at the Arctic Mid-Ocean Ridge (AMOR) in the Norwegian-Greenland Sea. The samples were taken at increasing distances from high-temperature venting chimneys towards areas with ultraslow low-temperature venting, encompassing a large variety in geochemical settings. Electron microscopy revealed the presence of biogenic iron stalks in all samples. Using 16S rRNA gene sequence profiling we found that relative abundances of Zetaproteobacteria in the iron mats varied from 0.2 to 37.9%. Biogeographic analyses of Zetaproteobacteria, using the ZetaHunter software, revealed the presence of ZetaOtus 1, 2 and 9, supporting the view that they are cosmopolitan. Relative abundances of co-occurring taxa, including Thaumarchaeota, Euryarchaeota and Proteobacteria, also varied substantially. From our results, combined with results from previous microbiological and geochemical analyses of the TWVF, we infer that the distribution of Zetaproteobacteria is connected to fluid-flow patterns and, ultimately, variations in chemical energy landscapes. Moreover, we provide evidence for iron-oxidizing members of Gallionellaceae being widespread in TWVF iron mats, albeit at low relative abundances.",2017,12,10.1371/journal.pone.0185008

Future mining of these nodule fields is predicted to have substantial effects on biodiversity and physicochemical conditions in mined areas. Yet, the identity and distributions of bacterial populations in deep-sea sediments and associated polymetallic nodules has received relatively little attention. We examined bacterial communities using high-throughput sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA gene fragments from samples collected in the water column, sediment, and polymetallic nodules in the Pacific Ocean (bottom depth =4,000 m) in the eastern Clarion-Clipperton Zone. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs; defined at 99% 16S rRNA gene identity) affiliated with JTB255 (Gammaproteobacteria) and Rhodospirillaceae (Alphaproteobacteria) had higher relative abundances in the nodule and sediment habitats compared to the water column. Rhodobiaceae family and Vibrio OTUs had higher relative abundance in nodule samples, but were less abundant in sediment and water column samples. Bacterial communities in sediments and associated with nodules were generally similar; however, 5,861 and 6,827 OTUs found in the water column were retrieved from sediment and nodule habitats, respectively. Cyanobacterial OTUs clustering among Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus were detected in both sediments and nodules, with greater representation among nodule samples. Such results suggest that vertical export of typically abundant photic-zone microbes may be an important process in delivery of water column microorganisms to abyssal habitats, potentially influencing the structure and function of communities in polymetallic nodule fields.",2017,8,10.3389/fmicb.2017.01696

Here, we study these interactions in three lineages of a globally distributed plant, Phragmites australis. We use field surveys and a common garden experiment to analyze bacterial communities in the rhizosphere of P. australis stands from native, introduced, and Gulf lineages to determine lineage-specific controls on rhizosphere bacteria. We show that within-lineage bacterial communities are similar, but are distinct among lineages, which is consistent with our results in a complementary common garden experiment. Introduced P. australis rhizosphere bacterial communities have lower abundances of pathways involved in antimicrobial biosynthesis and degradation, suggesting a lower exposure to enemy attack than native and Gulf lineages. However, lineage and not rhizosphere bacterial communities dictate individual plant growth in the common garden experiment. We conclude that lineage is crucial for determination of both rhizosphere bacterial communities and plant fitness.",2017,8,10.1038/s41467-017-00626-0
"Danczak, RE; Johnston, MD; Kenah, C; Slattery, M; Wrighton, KC; Wilkins, MJ",Members of the Candidate Phyla Radiation are functionally differentiated by carbon- and nitrogen-cycling capabilities,MICROBIOME,"Background: The Candidate Phyla Radiation (CPR) is a recently described expansion of the tree of life that represents more than 15% of all bacterial diversity and potentially contains over 70 different phyla. Despite this broad phylogenetic variation, these microorganisms appear to feature little functional diversity, with members generally characterized as obligate fermenters. Additionally, much of the data describing CPR phyla has been generated from a limited number of environments, constraining our knowledge of their functional roles and biogeographical distribution. To expand our understanding of subsurface CPR microorganisms, we sampled four separate groundwater wells over 2 years across three Ohio counties. Results: Samples were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene amplicon and shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Amplicon results indicated that CPR members comprised between 2 and 20% of the microbial communities with relative abundances stable through time in Athens and Greene samples but dynamic in Licking groundwater. Shotgun metagenomic analyses generated 71 putative CPR genomes, representing roughly 32 known phyla and 2 putative new phyla, Candidatus Brownbacteria and Candidatus Hugbacteria. While these genomes largely mirrored metabolic characteristics of known CPR members, some features were previously uncharacterized. For instance, nitrite reductase, encoded by nirK, was found in four of our Parcubacteria genomes and multiple CPR genomes from other studies, indicating a potentially undescribed role for these microorganisms in denitrification. Additionally, glycoside hydrolase (GH) family profiles for our 71 genomes and over 2000 other CPR genomes were analyzed to characterize their carbon-processing potential. Although common trends were present throughout the radiation, differences highlighted potential mechanisms that could allow microorganisms across the CPR to occupy various subsurface niches. For example, members of the Microgenomates superphylum appear to potentially degrade a wider range of carbon substrates than other CPR phyla. Conclusions: CPR members are present across a range of environments and often constitute a significant fraction of the microbial population in groundwater systems, particularly. Further sampling of such environments will resolve this portion of the tree of life at finer taxonomic levels, which is essential to solidify functional differences between members that populate this phylogenetically broad region of the tree of life.",2017,5,10.1186/s40168-017-0331-1

One cave species, macroinvertebrates, represents a heterogeneous group of animal taxa which is in constant danger of extinction, principally due to anthropogenic activities. Macroinvertebrates have been widely used as bioindicators of the quality of biogeographic zones, ecosystems, and protected areas, as well as to determine protected species. The Boca del Rio Cave is located in the biogeographic transition zone in Mexicos Neotropical region, and is home to a large enclave of different biotic elements. Twenty-nine organisms were collected and grouped into 19 families based on their morphological and physiological characteristics. The coefficient of taxonomic work (CTW) indicates that the taxonomic level family is the most consistent for all of the organisms collected. The Coenagronidae family was the most abundant in the study. The BMWP, ASPT, and SCI biotic index scores indicate that the water in the Boca del Rio Cave is slightly contaminated, while the Family Biotic Index (FBI) indicates poor water quality with very substantial organic pollution. The diversity of macroinvertebrate families confirms that the Boca del Rio Cave serves as an important refuge for fauna in the transition zone located in Mexicos Nearctic biogeographic region.

Here, we describe applications of computer-assisted microscopy using CMEIAS (Center for Microbial Ecology Image Analysis System) bioimage informatics software for a comprehensive analysis of river biofilm architectures and ecology. Natural biofilms were developed for four summer days on microscope slides of plain borosilicate glass and transparent polystyrene submerged in the Red Cedar River that flows through the Michigan State University campus. Images of the biofilm communities were acquired using brightfield and phase-contrast microscopy at spatial resolutions revealing details of microcolonies and individual cells, then digitally segmented to the foreground objects of interest. Phenotypic features of their size, abundance, surface texture, contour morphology, fractal geometry, ecophysiology, and landscape/spatial ecology were digitally extracted and evaluated by many discriminating statistical tests. The results indicate that river biofilm architecture exhibits significant geospatial structure in situ, providing many insights on the strong influence that substratum hydrophobicity-wettability exert on biofilm development and ecology, including their productivity and colonization intensity, morphological diversity/dominance/conditional rarity, nutrient apportionment/uptake efficiency/utilization, allometry/metabolic activity, responses to starvation and bacteriovory stresses, spatial patterns of distribution/dispersion/connectivity, and interpolated autocorrelations of cooperative/conflicting cell-cell interactions at real-world spatial scales directly relevant to their ecological niches. The significant impact of substratum physicochemistry was revealed for biofilms during their early immature stage of development in the river ecosystem. Bioimage informatics can fill major gaps in understanding the geomicrobiology and microbial ecology of biofilms in situ when examined at spatial scales suitable for phenotypic analysis at microcolony and single-cell resolutions.",2017,7,10.3390/geosciences7030056

Computed nutrient-light-salt limited algal growth supports grazing, mortality and carbon flow. Vertical transport is diffusive but responds to pore structure. Simulated bottom layer chlorophyll maxima are reasonable, though delayed by about a month relative to observations due to uncertainties in snow variability. Upper level biota arise intermittently during flooding events. Macromolecular concentrations are tracked as proxy proteins, polysaccharides, lipids and refractory humics. The fresh biopolymers undergo succession and removal by bacteria. Baseline organics enter solely through cell disruption, thus the internal carbon content is initially biased low.

At the global scale, there has been little intercontinental gene flow, and at a local scale, microbial composition is related to fine-scale features of the rocks and their environment. Few studies have investigated patterns of hypolithic community composition at intermediate distances. We examined hypolithic cyanobacterial diversity in semi-arid Australia along a 10-km transect by sampling six rocks from four adjacent 1m(2) quadrats (distance zero) and from additional quadrats at 10, 100, 1,000, and 10,000m to test the hypothesis that diversity would increase with the number of rocks sampled and distance. A total of 3,108 cyanobacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were detected. Most were neither widespread nor abundant. The few that were widespread tended to be abundant. There was no difference in the community composition between the four sites at distance zero, but the samples 10m away were significantly different, as were those at all other distances compared to distance zero. Many additional OTUs were recorded with increasing distance up to 100m. These patterns of distribution are consistent with a colonization model involving dispersal from rock to rock. Our results indicate that distance was a significant factor that can be confounded by interrock differences. Most diversity was represented in the first 100m of the transect, with an additional 1.5% of the total diversity added by the sample at 1km, but only 0.2% added with the addition of the 10-km site.",2017,7,10.1002/ece3.3248

In plants, fungal symbionts can ameliorate the abiotic stressors that accompany climate warming and thus could influence plants under a changing climate. Forecasting future plant-microbe interactions first requires knowledge of current fungal symbiont distributions, which are poorly resolved relative to the distributions of plants. Location: We used meta-analysis to summarize the biogeographic distributions of plant-fungal symbionts in mountain ecosystems worldwide, because these ecosystems are likely to be among the first to experience climate change-induced range shifts. Methods: We analysed 374 records from 53 publications to identify general trends, pinpoint areas in need of greater study and develop reporting guidelines to facilitate future syntheses. Results: Elevational patterns varied strongly among fungal and plant functional groups. Fungal diversity and abundance increased with altitude for the ectomycorrhizal fungi. However, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and localized foliar endophytes declined in either abundance or diversity with altitude. In shrubs, fungal abundance increased with elevation, but in C-3 grasses, fungal abundance declined with elevation. Altitudinal patterns in fungal composition were stronger than gradients in fungal abundance or diversity, suggesting that species turnover contributes more to elevational gradients in fungal symbionts than does variation in abundance or richness. Plant functional groups were overrepresented by C-3 grasses and trees, with surprisingly few data on sedges or shrubs, despite their ecological dominance in mountain ecosystems. Similarly, epichloae, ericoid mycorrhizal fungi and root endophytes were understudied relative to other fungal groups. Main Conclusions: Meta-analysis revealed broad biogeographic patterns in plant-fungal symbiont abundance, diversity and composition that inform predictions of future distributions.",2017,23,10.1111/ddi.12595

Here, with a large scale sampling along an elevational gradient of 2000 m in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, we examined the interplay among the three processes, as well as their relative importance to the biogeography of bacterial communities. Variation partitioning showed that environmental selection, competition and spatial variables jointly explained 37% of the total variation among the bacterial communities. The non-spatially structured environmental variables explained more variation than spatial distance or competition. Two environmental factors, elevation and soil pH, were shown to be the main cues determining soil bacterial communities. Environmental variables and spatial distance also exerted indirect effects on community variation via competition. The main conclusion of this study is consistent with the idea that the environment selects.

However, little is known about the determinants of their diversity and biogeographic patterns. Here, we compared fungal communities in rhizosphere and bulk soils of wheat fields in the North China Plain. The rhizosphere had a lower fungal diversity (observed OTUs and Chao1) than bulk soil, and a distinct fungal community structure in rhizosphere compared with bulk soil. The relative importance of environmental factors and geographic distance for fungal distribution differed between rhizosphere and bulk soil. Environmental factors were the primary cause of variations in total fungal community and major fungal phyla in bulk soil. By contrast, fungal communities in soils loosely attached to roots were predictable from both environmental factors and influences of geographic distance. Communities in soils tightly attached to roots were mainly determined by geographic distance. Our results suggest that both contemporary environment processes (present-day abiotic and biotic environment characters) and historical processes (spatial isolation, dispersal limitation occurred in the past) dominate variations of fungal communities in wheat fields, but their relative importance of all these processes depends on the proximity of fungal community to the plant roots.",2017,19,10.1111/1462-2920.13865

Differences in litter quality and in soil microbial community composition can influence the litter decomposition and home-field advantage (HFA). However, our knowledge about the relative role of litter and soil characteristics on litter decomposition and HFA effects is still limited, especially under long-term N deposition. 2. We collected soil and two types of litter (monospecific and mixed species litter) from five replicate plots from a long-term N deposition field experiment with seven N addition treatments (0, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 50 g N m(-2) year(-1)). We examined the effects of N addition on litter quality and soil characteristics. We then carried out a three-pronged microcosm decomposition experiment with (i) litter from different N addition treatments decomposed on a standard field soil; (ii) standard litter decomposed on soils from the different N addition treatments; and (iii) litter decomposed on soil from the same N addition treatment plot. 3. Decomposition of litter on standard soil was influenced strongly by the N addition treatment, but did not consistently decrease or increase with increasing N addition rates. Instead, decomposition of standard litter on soils collected from different N addition treatments decreased with increasing rates of N addition. Decomposition of litter on soil collected from the same plot increased with increasing N addition rates. Soil characteristics explained more of the variation in litter decomposition than litter characteristics. 4. There was a clear HFA effect for litter decomposition, both from a litter and from a soil perspective. HFA effects increased when the dissimilarity in litter quality (N content and C : N ratio) increase among the different N addition treatments and the soil effect was strongest at high N addition rates. 5. N addition influenced litter decomposition by changing both litter and soil characteristics. Importantly, N addition decreased the capability of soils to decompose litter and it increased the HFA effect indicating that soils decomposed local litter better than other litter, due to specialization in soil communities. Nitrogen deposition is an important threat to ecosystems worldwide and our study emphasizes that ecosystem functions such as decomposition can be greatly influenced by these global changes.",2017,31,10.1111/1365-2435.12863

Here, we compare NFR and diazotrophic diversity (assessed via high-throughput nifH sequencing) from a region known to be dominated by cyanobacterial diazotrophs (the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre, NPSG) to two regions dominated by heterotrophic diazotrophs: the Eastern South Pacific (ESP, from the Chilean upwelling system to the subtropical gyre) and the Pacific Northwest coastal upwelling system (PNW). We observed distinct biogeographical patterns among the three regions. Diazotrophic community structure differed strongly between the NPSG, dominated by cyanobacterium UCYN-A, and the ESP, dominated by heterotrophic nifH group 1J/1K, yet surface NFR were similar in magnitude (up to 5.1 nmol N L-1 d(-1)). However, while diverse, predominantly heterotrophic nifH genes were recovered from the PNW and the mesopelagic of the NPSG, NFR were undetectable in both of these environments (although glucose amendments stimulated low rates in the deep NPSG). Our work suggests that while diazotrophs may be nearly omnipresent in marine waters, the activity of this functional group is regionally restricted. Further, we show that the detection limits of the N-15(2) fixation assay suggest that many of the low NFR reported for the mesopelagic (often< 0.1 nmol N L-1 d(-1) in the literature) are not indicative of active diazotrophy, highlighting the challenges of assessing the ecosystem significance of heterotrophic diazotrophs.",2017,62,10.1002/lno.10542

Patterns of ancient admixture in Helicobacter pylori can be reconstructed in concordance with past human migration, whereas in Mycobacterium tuberculosis it is the lack of recombination that causes allopatric clusters. In Campylobacter, analyses of genomic data and molecular typing have been successful in determining the reservoir host species, but not geographical origin. We investigated biogeographical variation in highly recombining genes to determine the extent of clustering between genomes from geographically distinct Campylobacter populations. Whole-genome sequences from 294 Campylobacter isolates from North America and the UK were analysed. Isolates from within the same country shared more recently recombined DNA than isolates from different countries. Using 15 UK/American closely matched pairs of isolates that shared ancestors, we identify regions that have frequently and recently recombined to test their correlation with geographical origin. The seven genes that demonstrated the greatest clustering by geography were used in an attribution model to infer geographical origin which was tested using a further 383 UK clinical isolates to detect signatures of recent foreign travel. Patient records indicated that in 46 cases, travel abroad had occurred less than two weeks prior to sampling, and genomic analysis identified that 34 (74%) of these isolates were of a non-UK origin.

A recent sampling revealed that only a few fungal groups, as defined by internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) sequence similarity, dominate culturable root endophytic communities of nonmycorrhizal Microthlaspi spp. plants across Europe. Strains of these fungi display a broad phenotypic and functional diversity, which suggests a genetic variability masked by ITS clustering into operational taxonomic units (OTUs). The aims of this study were to identify how genetic similarity patterns of these fungi change across environments and to evaluate their ability to disperse and adapt to ecological conditions. A first ITS-based haplotype analysis of ten widespread OTUs mostly showed a low to moderate genotypic differentiation, with the exception of a group identified as Cadophora sp. that was highly diverse. A multilocus phylogeny based on additional genetic loci (partial translation elongation factor 1 alpha, beta-tubulin and actin) and amplified fragment length polymorphism profiling of 185 strains representative of the five dominant OTUs revealed a weak association of genetic differences with geography and environmental conditions, including bioclimatic and soil factors.

The spatial organization of this system is thought to be important in human health, yet this aspect of our resident microbiome is still poorly understood. In this study, we report significant spatial structure of the GI microbiota, and we identify general categories of spatial patterning in the distribution of microbial taxa along a healthy human GI tract. We further estimate the biotic interaction structure in the GI microbiota, both through time series and cooccurrence modeling of microbial community data derived from a large number of sequentially collected fecal samples. Comparison of these two approaches showed that species pairs involved in significant negative interactions had strong positive contemporaneous correlations and vice versa, while for species pairs without significant interactions, contemporaneous correlations were distributed around zero. We observed similar patterns when comparing these models to the spatial correlations between taxa identified in the adherent microbiota. This suggests that colocalization of microbial taxon pairs, and thus the spatial organization of the GI microbiota, is driven, at least in part, by direct or indirect biotic interactions. Thus, our study can provide a basis for an ecological interpretation of the biogeography of the human gut. IMPORTANCE The human gut microbiome is the subject of intense study due to its importance in health and disease. The majority of these studies have been based on the analysis of feces. However, little is known about how the microbial composition in fecal samples relates to the spatial distribution of microbial taxa along the gastrointestinal tract. By characterizing the microbial content both in intestinal tissue samples and in fecal samples obtained daily, we provide a conceptual framework for how the spatial structure relates to biotic interactions on the community level. We further describe general categories of spatial distribution patterns and identify taxa conforming to these categories.

To estimate the evolutionary history of bean-nodulating Rhizobium etli-like bacteria in China, the genetic diversity and population structures of 77 strains belonging to seven genomic species isolated from eight sites in the temperate and subtropical regions were investigated in this study. As results, seven clades were defined in the phylogenetic network based upon the sequences of eight housekeeping and adaptation genes, in which some strains of different genospecies were intermingled due to the effects of adaptation genes on the phylogeny of chromosome. The close phylogenetic relationships of the tested strains with a Columbian strain R. etli CIAT 652, and their deeply separating from the Mexican reference strains demonstrated the evolution of Chinese bean-nodulating bacteria directly from the ancestors of South America. Distinct populations with varied haplotype diversity and nucleotide diversity were observed in the alkaline, strong acid and neutral-acid soils, and they may be affected by natural selection in the alkaline strong acid soils, or by the neutral selection in other sampling sites. The isolates in the neutral and acid soils were admixture containing more of the ancestral lineages similar to the American strains, while the isolates in strong acid (Chutan) and alkaline (Daqing) soils formed independent clusters. Soil factors shaped the rhizobial populations stronger than the geographic distance. Moreover, recombination contributed more in the evolution of R. etli-related populations than mutation.

Here we describe the core seed bank of a bacterial metacommunity from a boreal watershed, using the spatial distribution of bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) across 223 heterogeneous terrestrial, aquatic and phyllosphere bacterial assemblages. Taxa were considered potential seeds if they transitioned from rare to abundant somewhere within the metacommunity and if they were ubiquitous and able to persist under unfavorable conditions, the latter assessed by checking their presence in three deeply sequenced samples (one soil, one river and one lake, 2.2-3 million reads per sample). We show that only a small fraction (13%) of all detected OTUs constitute a metacommunity seed bank that is shared between all terrestrial and aquatic communities, but not by phyllosphere assemblages, which seem to recruit from a different taxa pool. Our results suggest directional recruitment driven by the flow of water in the landscape, since most aquatic sequences were associated to OTUs found in a single deeply-sequenced soil sample, but only 45% of terrestrial sequences belonged to OTUs found in the two deeply-sequenced aquatic communities. Finally, we hypothesize that extreme rarity, and its interplay with water residence time and growth rates, may further constrain the size of the potential seed bank.",2017,11,10.1038/ismej.2017.67

The coastal dune grass Ammophila arenaria has been moved around the world. We sampled A. arenaria roots in its native range in the United Kingdom, and in Australia and New Zealand where it is invasive. The co-occurring native dune grass Leymus arenarius was also sampled in the United Kingdom, and the native dune grass Spinifex sericeus was sampled in Australia and New Zealand. A. arenaria associates with root fungal communities in its invasive range that are richer than those in the United Kingdom, and richer than those in co-occurring native grasses, demonstrating that exotic plants are not necessarily depauperate in fungal associates. Most of the dominant OTUs associating with A. arenaria were shared among all three geographic regions. However, community composition varied among regions, with differences in temperature, nitrogen and pH correlating with community change. Within regions, community composition varied among dunes, although the majority of sequences obtained were in OTUs that were detected in multiple dunes. Host plant species identity influenced fungal community composition, although the majority of the data were in OTUs that were shared between hosts. While the roots sampled appeared healthy, many of the dominant fungi recovered are potentially pathogenic. This study demonstrates that many fungi are widely dispersed, and that introduced plants are likely to associate with functionally diverse fungal communities that include species from their native ranges. However root-associated fungal community composition is variable, even at regional and local scales in a common plant in a common environment. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Furthermore, changes in the microbial community associated with increased seawater temperatures can cause opportunistic infections, coral disease and death. Interactions between soft corals and their associated microbes are not well understood. The species Scleronephthya gracillimum is distributed in tropical to temperate zones in coral assemblages along the Kuroshio Current region. In this study we collected S. gracillimum from various sites at different latitudes, and compared composition of their bacterial communities using Next Generation Sequencing. Coral samples from six geographically distinct areas (two sites each in Taiwan, Japan, and Korea) had considerable variation in their associated bacterial communities and diversity. Endozoicimonaceae was the dominant group in corals from Korea and Japan, whereas Mycoplasma was dominant in corals from Taiwan corals. Interestingly, the latter corals had lower relative abundance of Endozoicimonaceae, but greater diversity. These biogeographic differences in bacterial composition may have been due to varying environmental conditions among study locations, or because of host responses to prevailing environmental conditions. This study provided a baseline for future studies of soft coral microbiomes, and assessment of functions of host metabolites and soft coral holobionts.",2017,12,10.1371/journal.pone.0183663

We used high-throughput amplicon sequencing of the bacterial small subunit (SSU) rRNA gene from 22 microbial mats collected from four hydrothermally active locations along the Mariana Arc and back-arc to explore the structure of lithotrophically-based microbial mat communities. The vent effluent was classified as iron- or sulfur-rich corresponding with two distinct community types, dominated by either Zetaproteobacteria or Epsilonproteobacteria, respectively. The Zetaproteobacterial-based communities had the highest richness and diversity, which supports the hypothesis that Zetaproteobacteria function as ecosystem engineers creating a physical habitat within a chemical environment promoting enhanced microbial diversity. Gammaproteobacteria were also high in abundance within the iron-dominated mats and some likely contribute to primary production. In addition, we also compare sampling scale, showing that bulk sampling of microbial mats yields higher diversity than micro-scale sampling. We present a comprehensive analysis and offer new insights into the community structure and diversity of lithotrophically-driven microbial mats from a hydrothermal region associated with high microbial biodiversity.

These mixotrophs, lacking a constitutive capacity for photosynthesis (i.e. non-constitutive mixotrophs, NCMs), acquire their phototrophic potential through either integration of prey-plastids or through endosymbiotic associations with photosynthetic microbes. Analysis of field data reveals that 40-60% of plankton traditionally labelled as (non-phototrophic) microzooplankton are actually NCMs, employing acquired phototrophy in addition to phagotrophy. Specialist NCMs acquire chloroplasts or endosymbionts from specific prey, while generalist NCMs obtain chloroplasts from a variety of prey. These contrasting functional types of NCMs exhibit distinct seasonal and spatial global distribution patterns. Mixotrophs reliant on stolen chloroplasts, controlled by prey diversity and abundance, dominate in high-biomass areas. Mixotrophs harbouring intact symbionts are present in all waters and dominate particularly in oligotrophic open ocean systems. The contrasting temporal and spatial patterns of distribution of different mixotroph functional types across the oceanic provinces, as revealed in this study, challenges traditional interpretations of marine food web structures.

Here, by using the network-based analyses with three paralleled data sets derived from 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing, functional microarray, and predicted metagenome, we test our hypothesis that the network interactions of traits are more conserved than those of taxonomic measures, with significantly lower variation of network characteristics along the environmental gradient in acid mine drainage. The results showed that although the overall network characteristics remained similar, the structural variation was significantly lower at trait levels. The higher conserved individual node topological properties at trait level rather than at species level indicated that the responses of diverse traits remained relatively consistent even though different species played key roles under different environmental conditions. Additionally, the randomization tests revealed that it could not reject the null hypothesis that species- based correlations were random, while the tests suggested that correlation patterns of traits were non-random. Furthermore, relationships between trait-based network characteristics and environmental properties implied that trait-based networks might be more useful in reflecting the variation of ecosystem function. Taken together, our results suggest that deterministic trait-based community assembly results in greater conservation of network interaction, which may ensure ecosystem function across environmental regimes, emphasizing the potential importance of measuring the complexity and conservation of network interaction in evaluating the ecosystem stability and functioning.",2017,8,10.3389/fmicb.2017.01486

The few previous molecular studies of microbes in supraglacial debris have either had limited phylogenetic resolution, limited spatial resolution (e.g. only one sample site on the glacier) or both. Here, we present the microbiome of a debris-covered glacier across all three domains of life, using a spatially-explicit sampling scheme to characterize the Middle Fork Toklat Glaciers microbiome from its terminus to sites high on the glacier. Our results show that microbial communities differ across the supraglacial transect, but surprisingly these communities are strongly spatially autocorrelated, suggesting the presence of a supraglacial chronosequence. This pattern is dominated by phototrophic microbes (both bacteria and eukaryotes) which are less abundant near the terminus and more abundant higher on the glacier. We use these data to refute the hypothesis that the inhabitants of the glacier are randomly deposited atmospheric microbes, and to provide evidence that succession from a predominantly photosynthetic to a more heterotrophic community is occurring on the glacier.",2017,93,10.1093/femsec/fix095

However, the mechanisms underlying the assembly of prokaryotic communities are largely unexplored at taxonomic and functional levels, simultaneously. Here, we investigated the spatio-seasonal distribution of prokaryoplankton communities in a salinity-influenced watershed, China using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. The OTUs were divided into core and satellite, based on a statistical approach. Our results indicated that the core taxa accounted for 87.4% of all the communities, predominantly including Betaproteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Thaumarchaeota. Whereas 10 of 22 metabolic phenotypes annotated using METAGENassist had significantly higher relative abundances in the core than satellite communities. Temporal variations in the composition of ammonia-oxidizing prokaryotes could be attributed to the seasonal nutrient concentrations. Multivariate statistical analysis indicated that environmental filtering rather than dispersal limitation is the primary mechanism driving the assembly of the whole, core and satellite communities at both taxonomic and functional levels. Network analysis revealed that the mutualistic interactions might also have certain roles in the assembly of the core taxonomic community. However, taxonomic community fluctuations can only partially reflect the functional community variations.

Independent surveys of yeasts associated with flowers and pollinators in South Africa led to the discovery of 38 strains of two new species. Physiological profiles and analysis of the internal transcribed spacer and the D1/D2 domains of the large subunit rRNA gene showed that they represent two novel species that belong to the Wickerhamiella clade.

This is exemplified in the American Midwest by efforts aimed at reclaiming historical grasslands lost to high-yield agriculture. While restorations traditionally take the form of plant reintroduction and management, advances in microbial analyses suggest that soil communities could be indicators restoration success. However, current understanding of key microbial taxa and functional activities in both natural and restored ecosystems is limited. Here, we investigated the impact of nearly 30 years of carefully managed restoration on soil microbial communities at the Nachusa Grasslands in northern Illinois, USA. We characterized bacterial and archaeal communities in a chronosequence of restored tallgrass prairies ranging from 1 to 27 years old across a growing season and compared them to communities in pre-restoration agricultural fields and remnant prairies. Results indicate that older restorations harboured communities statistically distinct from newer restorations. These communities converged toward those in local prairie remnants, suggesting that plant-focussed restoration has yielded soil bacterial communities reflective of a successful restoration. Recovery of microbial clades within the Verrucomicrobia and Acidobacteria are an important feature of this convergence, and these groups could be targeted for future soil-focussed, bottom-up restoration studies.",2017,19,10.1111/1462-2920.13785

Even though salt was previously identified as a major transition boundary for micro- and macroorganisms alike, the salinities causing species turnover in protistan communities are unknown. We investigated 4.5 million high-quality protistan metabarcodes (V4 region of the SSU rDNA) obtained from 24 shallow salt ponds (salinities 4%-44%) from South America and Europe. Statistical analyses of protistan community profiles identified four salinity classes, which strongly selected for different protistan communities: 4-9%, 14-24%, 27-36% and 38-44%. The proportion of organisms unknown to science is highest in the 14-24% salinity class, showing that environments within this salinity range are an unappreciated reservoir of as yet undiscovered organisms. Distinct higher-rank taxon groups dominated in the four salinity classes in terms of diversity. As increasing salinities require different cellular responses to cope with salt, our results suggest that different evolutionary lineages of protists have evolved distinct haloadaptation strategies. Salinity appears to be a stronger selection factor for the structuring of protistan communities than geography. Yet, we find a higher degree of endemism in shallow salt ponds compared with less isolated ecosystems such as the open ocean. Thus, rules for biogeographic structuring of protistan communities are not universal, but depend on the ecosystem under consideration.",2017,19,10.1111/1462-2920.13805

The variation in endophytic communities in above and below-ground organs in Vitis vinifera in the field were studied. To understand the specific effect of temperature on endophytic communities, a separate experiment was set up where grapevine cuttings were grown under controlled conditions at three different temperatures. The findings revealed the succession of endophytic communities over the year. Endophytic communities of roots and stems differ in terms of composition and dynamic response to temperature. Noticeably, compositional differences during the seasons affected bacterial taxa more in stems than in roots, suggesting that roots offer a more stable and less easily perturbed environment.

In addition to avoiding the environmental and financial costs of expanding traditional built infrastructure, green infrastructure is thought to generate cobenefits in the form of diverse ecological processes performed by its plant and microbial communities. Yet, although plant communities in these habitats are closely managed, we lack basic knowledge about how engineered ecosystems impact the distribution and functioning of soil bacteria. We sequenced amplicons of the 16S ribosomal subunit, as well as seven genes associated with functional pathways, generated from both total (DNA-based) and expressed (RNA) soil communities in the Bronx, NYC, NY, in order to test whether bioswale soils host characteristic bacterial communities with evidence for enriched microbial functioning, compared to nonengineered soils in park lawns and tree pits. Bioswales had distinct, phylogenetically diverse bacterial communities, including taxa associated with nutrient cycling and metabolism of hydrocarbons and other pollutants. Bioswale soils also had a significantly greater diversity of genes involved in several functional pathways, including carbon fixation (cbbL-R [cbbL gene, red-like subunit] and apsA), nitrogen cycling (noxZ and amoA), and contaminant degradation (bphA); conversely, no functional genes were significantly more abundant in nonengineered soils. These results provide preliminary evidence that urban land management can shape the diversity and activity of soil communities, with positive consequences for genetic resources underlying valuable ecological functions, including biogeochemical cycling and degradation of common urban pollutants. IMPORTANCE Management of urban soil biodiversity by favoring taxa associated with decontamination or other microbial metabolic processes is a powerful prospect, but it first requires an understanding of how engineered soil habitats shape patterns of microbial diversity. This research adds to our understanding of urban microbial biogeography by providing data on soil bacteria in bioswales, which had relatively diverse and compositionally distinct communities compared to park and tree pit soils. Bioswales also contained comparatively diverse pools of genes related to carbon sequestration, nitrogen cycling, and contaminant degradation, suggesting that engineered soils may serve as effective reservoirs of functional microbial biodiversity. We also examined both total (DNA-based) and expressed (RNA) communities, revealing that total bacterial communities (the exclusive targets in the vast majority of soil studies) were poor predictors of expressed community diversity, pointing to the value of quantifying RNA, especially when ecological functioning is considered.",2017,83,10.1128/AEM.00287-17

Here, we described cyanobacterial mats as well as epi- and endoliths collected from shallow streams and rocks, respectively, in the northwestern part of Svalbard. Thirteen populations were identified and characterized by employing morphological and molecular (16S rRNA gene sequences) techniques. Our results were compared to analogous information (available from the GenBank) and related to organisms from similar environments located in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. In general, the morphological and molecular characterizations complemented each other, and the identified Arctic populations belonged to the following orders: Oscillatoriales (6), Nostocales (6), and Chroococcales (1). Twelve of the identified polar populations showed high similarity (94-99% 16S rRNA gene sequence) when compared to other Arctic and Antarctic cyanobacteria. Mat builder Phormidium autumnale shared only 88% similarity with sequences deposited in the GenBank. Our results demonstrate remarkable similarities of microbial life of Svalbard to that in Antarctica and the High Himalayas. Our findings are a starting point for future comparative research of the benthic as well as endolithic populations of cyanobacteria from the Arctic and Antarctica that will yield new insights into the cold and dry limits of life on Earth.

A total of 7560 specimens from 155 limestone samples (within the interval of Lenodus variabilis - Pygodus anserinus biozones) are assigned to 22 species, representing a low taxonomic diversity and low abundance fauna. The fauna is dominated by the Acrotretoidea, mainly species of the Torynelasmatidae, with Torynelasma the most abundant (more than 40% of total number of specimens), along with the Eoconulidae and Eoconulus (18% of total) representing the second most common forms. Species of the Ephippelasmatidae are also common (16% of total) diverse, and include representatives of Myotreta and Numericoma, as well as Ephippelasma, whereas species of the Scaphelasmatidae are somewhat less common (13% of total). All three investigated sections represent outer shelf environments, but the Maocaopu section is situated in a relatively deeper position, in proximity of the south-eastern outer margin of the Upper Yangtze Platform, close to its boundary with the Jiangnan Slope. A quantitative analysis of the relative abundance data was carried out in order to investigate the biofacies distribution of the micromorphic brachiopod communities across the Yangtze Platform, something that has not been attempted before with Palaeozoic linguliforms. Six lingulate microbrachiopod communities could be recognized in the sections. The major biofacies shift, which occurred in the Cili section in the upper part of the Microzarkodina ozarkodella Zone, at the time of the onset and initial rise of the Mid Darriwilian Carbon Isotope Excursion (MDICE) suggests that these biofacies may have been depth controlled.",2017,3,10.1002/spp2.1077

Using a DNA sequencing approach, we explored the biogeography of biofilm bacterial communities in 204 streams across a approximate to 1000 km latitudinal gradient. The range sizes of bacterial taxa were strongly correlated with latitude, decreasing closer to the equator, which coincided with a greater than fivefold increase in bacterial taxonomic richness. The relative richness and range size of bacteria were associated with spatially correlated variation in temperature and rainfall. These patterns were observed despite enormous variability in catchment environmental characteristics. Similar results were obtained when restricting the same analyses to native forest catchments, thereby controlling for spatial biases in land use. We analysed genomic data from approximate to 500 taxa detected in this study, for which data were available and found that bacterial communities at cooler latitudes also tended to possess greater potential metabolic potential. Collectively, these data provide the first evidence of latitudinal variation in the range size distributions of freshwater bacteria, a trend which may be determined, in part, by a trade-off between bacterial genome size and local variation in climatic conditions.",2017,19,10.1111/1462-2920.13797

The aim of this study was to examine the elevational trends in species richness and local contribution to beta diversity (LCBD) of three biofilm microbial groups in freshwater ponds and to identify the key mechanisms underlying these patterns. Location: One hundred and forty-six ponds in subarctic Finland and Norway distributed across the tree line along an elevational gradient of 10-1,038 m a.s.l., spanning from forested landscape to barren boulder fields. Time period: July-August 2015. Major taxa studied: Diatoms, cyanobacteria and non-cyanobacteria. Methods: Generalized linear models were used to identify the most important pond variables explaining richness and LCBD. Structural equation models were used to explore the direct and indirect effects of multiscale drivers on richness and LCBD. Results: Diatom and cyanobacteria richness showed unimodal elevational patterns, whereas non-cyanobacteria richness decreased with increasing elevation. The LCBD-elevation relationship was U-shaped for all three microbial groups. Diatom and cyanobacteria richness and LCBD were best explained by local pond variables, especially by pH. Non-cyanobacteria richness and LCBD were related to pond variables, elevation as a proxy for climatic conditions, and normalized difference vegetation index as a proxy for terrestrial productivity. Main conclusions: Aquatic autotrophs were primarily controlled by environmental filtering, whereas heterotrophic bacteria were also affected by terrestrial productivity and elevation.

"Golan, JJ; Pringle, A",Long-Distance Dispersal of Fungi,MICROBIOLOGY SPECTRUM,"Dispersal is a fundamental biological process, operating at multiple temporal and spatial scales. Despite an increasing understanding of fungal biodiversity, most research on fungal dispersal focuses on only a small fraction of species. Thus, any discussion of the dispersal dynamics of fungi as a whole is problematic. While abundant morphological and biogeographic data are available for hundreds of species, researchers have yet to integrate this information into a unifying paradigm of fungal dispersal, especially in the context of long-distance dispersal (LDD). Fungal LDD is mediated by multiple vectors, including meteorological phenomena (e.g., wind and precipitation), plants (e.g., seeds and senesced leaves), animals (e.g., fur, feathers, and gut microbiomes), and in many cases humans. In addition, fungal LDD is shaped by both physical constraints on travel and the ability of spores to survive harsh environments. Finally, fungal LDD is commonly measured in different ways, including by direct capture of spores, genetic comparisons of disconnected populations, and statistical modeling and simulations of dispersal data. To unify perspectives on fungal LDD, we propose a synthetic three-part definition that includes (i) an identification of the source population and a measure of the concentration of source inoculum and (ii) a measured and/or modeled dispersal kernel.

Aromatic-ring-hydroxylating dioxygenases (ARHD) are proteins involved in AH degradation pathways. We used ARHD functional genes from an oil-impacted mangrove area and compared their diversity with other sites around the world to understand the ARHD biogeographic distribution patterns. For this, a comprehensive database was established with 166 operational protein families (OPFs) from 1,758 gene sequences obtained from 15 different sites worldwide, of which twelve are already published studies and three are unpublished. Based on a deduced ARHD peptide sequences consensus phylogeny, we examined trends and divergences in the sequence phylogenetic clustering from the different sites. The taxonomic affiliation of the OPF revealed that Pseudomonas, Streptomyces, Variovorax, Bordetella and Rhodococcus were the five most abundant genera, considering all sites. The functional diversity analysis showed the enzymatic prevalence of benzene 1,2-dioxygenase, 3-phenylpropionate dioxygenase and naphthalene 1,2-dioxygenase, in addition to 10.98% of undefined category ARHDs. The ARHD gene correlation analysis among different sites was essentially important to gain insights on spatial distribution patterns, genetic congruence and ecological coherence of the bacterial groups found.

We hypothesize that, in the time between these periods, extinction of local plant species and addition of exotic plants modified phylogenetic-alpha-diversity at different levels (deeper and terminal phylogeny) and increased phylo-beta-diversity among islands. Based on floristic studies, we assembled a phylogenetic tree from occurrence data that includes 921 species, of which 165 and 756 were native or exotic in origin, respectively. Then, we studied change in the phylo-alpha-diversity and phylo-beta-diversity (1-Phylosor) by comparing pre-European and current times. Despite extinction of 18 native angiosperm species, an increase in species richness and phylo-adiversity was observed for all islands studied, attributed to introduction of exotic plants (between 6 to 477 species per island). We did not observe significant variation of mean phylogenetic distance (MPD), a measure of the deeper phylogenetic diversity of assemblages (e.g., orders, families), suggesting that neither extinctions nor introductions altered phylogenetic structure of the angiosperms of these islands. In regard to phylo-beta-diversity, we detected temporal turnover (variation in phylogenetic composition) between periods to flora (0.38 � 0.11). However, when analyses were performed only considering native plants, we did not observe significant temporal turnover between periods (0.07 � 0.06). These results indicate that introduction of exotic angiosperms has contributed more notably than extinctions to the configuration of plant assemblages and phylogenetic diversity on the studied islands. Because phylogenetic diversity is closely related to functional diversity (species trait variations and roles performed by organisms), our results suggests that the introduction of exotic plants to these islands could have detrimental impacts for ecosystem functions and ecosystem services that islands provide (e.g. productivity).",2017,12,10.1371/journal.pone.0182105

The structural and activity changes of methanogenic communities in the degrading permafrost-affected wetlands on the Tibetan Plateau can serve as fundamental elements for modelling feedback interaction of ecosystems to climate change. Hence, we aimed at anticipating if and how the rapid environmental changes occurring especially on the high altitude Tibetan platform will affect methanogenic communities. We identified methanogenic community composition, activity and abundance in wetland soils with different hydrological settings, permafrost extent and soil properties and pinpoint the environmental controls. We show that despite a pronounced natural gradient, the Tibetan high elevation wetland soils host a large methanogenic core microbiome. Hydrogenotrophic methanogens, in particular Methanoregula, and H2-dependent methanogenesis were overall dominant although acetoclastic methanogens in addition to hydrogenotrophs were among the dominating taxa in a minerotrophic fen. Tracing the Methanoregula community of the Tibetan Plateau using public databases revealed its global relevance in natural terrestrial habitats. Unlike the composition, the activity and abundance of methanogens varied strongly in the studied soils with higher values in alpine swamps than in alpine meadows. This study indicates that in the course of current wetland and permafrost degradation and the loss in soil moisture, a decrease in the methane production potential is expected on the high Tibetan Plateau but it will not lead to pronounced changes within the methanogenic community structure.

These microbes are keystone organisms of soil ecosystems and regulate essential processes of soil fertility such as nutrient cycling and plant growth. Despite this, protists have received little scientific attention, especially compared to bacteria, fungi and nematodes in soil studies. Recent methodological advances, particularly in molecular biology techniques, have made the study of soil protists more accessible, and have created a resurgence of interest in soil protistology. This ongoing revolution now enables comprehensive investigations of the structure and functioning of soil protist communities, paving the way to a new era in soil biology. Instead of providing an exhaustive review, we provide a synthesis of research gaps that should be prioritized in future studies of soil protistology to guide this rapidly developing research area. Based on a synthesis of expert opinion we propose 30 key questions covering a broad range of topics including evolution, phylogenetics, functional ecology, macroecology, paleoecology, and methodologies. These questions highlight a diversity of topics that will establish soil protistology as a hub discipline connecting different fundamental and applied fields such as ecology, biogeography, evolution, plant-microbe interactions, agronomy, and conservation biology. We are convinced that soil protistology has the potential to be one of the most exciting frontiers in biology. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2017,111,10.1016/j.soilbio.2017.04.001

Although we assume this decline will greatly affect ecosystem functioning, particularly in alpine and arctic areas where cryptogams make a substantial amount of biomass, the effects of this change in vegetation on soil microbial communities remains unknown. We asked whether changes in bacterial community composition and enzyme ratios were consistent across two sites in moss versus vascular plant dominated areas. Using data from treeline and subnival ecosystems, we compared bacterial community composition, enzyme activity, and soil chemistry in moss dominated and vascular plant dominated plots of two unique alpine environments. Further, we used a time series to examine plots that actively transitioned from moss dominated to vascular plant dominated over a seven-year time period. Bacterial community composition in the soils under these two vegetation covers was significantly different in both environments and changed over time due to plant colonization. Microbial activity was limited by carbon and phosphorus in all plots and there were no differences in BG:AP enzyme ratios; however, there were significantly higher NAG:AP and BG:AP ratios in vascular plant plots at one site, suggesting the potential for shifts toward microbial N acquisition in vascular plant dominated areas in the alpine. As vascular plants replace mosses under warming conditions, bacterial community composition and nutrient availability shift in ways that may result in changes to biogeochemical cycling and biotic interactions in these vulnerable ecosystems.

In high-iron environments, such as diffuse hydrothermal vents, the Zetaproteobacteria are important members of the community driving its structure. Biogeography of Zetaproteobacteria has shown two ubiquitous operational taxonomic units (OTUs), yet much is unknown about their genomic diversity. Genome-resolved metagenomics allows for the specific binning of microbial genomes based on genomic signatures present in composite metagenome assemblies. This resulted in the recovery of 93 genome bins, of which 34 were classified as Zetaproteobacteria. Form II ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase genes were recovered from nearly all the Zetaproteobacteria genome bins. In addition, the Zetaproteobacteria genome bins contain genes for uptake and utilization of bioavailable nitrogen, detoxification of arsenic, and a terminal electron acceptor adapted for low oxygen concentration. Our results also support the hypothesis of a Cyc2-like protein as the site for iron oxidation, now detected across a majority of the Zetaproteobacteria genome bins. Whole genome comparisons showed a high genomic diversity across the Zetaproteobacteria OTUs and genome bins that were previously unidentified by SSU rRNA gene analysis. A single lineage of cosmopolitan Zetaproteobacteria (zOTU 2) was found to be monophyletic, based on cluster analysis of average nucleotide identity and average amino acid identity comparisons. From these data, we can begin to pinpoint genomic adaptations of the more ecologically ubiquitous Zetaproteobacteria, and further understand their environmental constraints and metabolic potential.",2017,11,10.1038/ismej.2017.40
"Shirani, S; Hellweger, FL",Neutral Evolution and Dispersal Limitation Produce Biogeographic Patterns in Microcystis aeruginosa Populations of Lake Systems,MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,"Molecular observations reveal substantial biogeographic patterns of cyanobacteria within systems of connected lakes. An important question is the relative role of environmental selection and neutral processes in the biogeography of these systems. Here, we quantify the effect of genetic drift and dispersal limitation by simulating individual cyanobacteria cells using an agent-based model (ABM). In the model, cells grow (divide), die, and migrate between lakes. Each cell has a full genome that is subject to neutral mutation (i.e., the growth rate is independent of the genome). The model is verified by simulating simplified lake systems, for which theoretical solutions are available. Then, it is used to simulate the biogeography of the cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa in a number of real systems, including the Great Lakes, Klamath River, Yahara River, and Chattahoochee River. Model output is analyzed using standard bioinformatics tools (BLAST, MAFFT). The emergent patterns of nucleotide divergence between lakes are dynamic, including gradual increases due to accumulation of mutations and abrupt changes due to population takeovers by migrant cells (coalescence events). The model predicted nucleotide divergence is heterogeneous within systems, and for weakly connected lakes, it can be substantial. For example, Lakes Superior and Michigan are predicted to have an average genomic nucleotide divergence of 8200 bp or 0.14%. The divergence between more strongly connected lakes is much lower. Our results provide a quantitative baseline for future biogeography studies. They show that dispersal limitation can be an important factor in microbe biogeography, which is contrary to the common belief, and could affect how a system responds to environmental change.",2017,74,10.1007/s00248-017-0963-5
"Verstraete, B; Janssens, S; Ronsted, N",Non-nodulated bacterial leaf symbiosis promotes the evolutionary success of its host plants in the coffee family (Rubiaceae),MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION,"Every plant species on Earth interacts in some way or another with microorganisms and it is well known that certain forms of symbiosis between different organisms can drive evolution. Within some clades of Rubiaceae (coffee family), a specific plant-bacteria interaction exists in which non-pathological endophytes are present in the leaves of their hosts. It is hypothesized that the bacterial endophytes, either alone or by interacting with the host, provide chemical protection against herbivory or pathogens by producing toxic or otherwise advantageous secondary metabolites. If the bacteria indeed have a direct beneficial influence on their hosts, it is reasonable to assume that the endophytes may increase the fitness of their hosts and therefore it is probable that their presence also has an influence on the long-term evolution of the particular plant lineages. In this study, the possible origin in time of non-nodulated bacterial leaf symbiosis in the Vanguerieae tribe of Rubiaceae is elucidated and dissimilarities in evolutionary dynamics between species with endophytes versus species without are investigated. Bacterial leaf symbiosis is shown to have most probably originated in the Late Miocene, a period when the savannah habitat is believed to have expanded on the African continent and herbivore pressure increased. The presence of bacterial leaf endophytes appears to be restricted to Old World lineages so far. Plant lineages with leaf endophytes show a significantly higher speciation rate than plant lineages without endophytes, while there is only a small difference in extinction rate. The transition rate shows that evolving towards having endophytes is twice as fast as evolving towards not having endophytes, suggesting that leaf symbiosis must be beneficial for the host plants. We conclude that the presence of bacterial leaf endophytes may also be an important driver for speciation of host plants. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

However, the key environmental drivers shaping CH4 oxidation rate at regional and sub-regional scales in grassland ecosystems remain poorly understood. In this study, we collected soils from 21 sites at the regional scale across three steppes of China, including grasslands in Inner Mongolia Plateau (IMP), Xinjiang Autonomous Region (XAR) and Tibetan Plateau (TP). Potential CH4 oxidation rate was measured, and the compositions and abundances of methanotrophs were analyzed by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and Miseq sequencing technique. The factors controlling CH4 oxidation potential at regional and sub-regional scales were evaluated by means of partial least squares path modeling (PLS-PM) and multiple regression on distance matrices (MRM). The results showed that the compositions and abundances of methanotrophs varied at different sub-regions. Type I methanotrophs were predominant in soils from the Inner Mongolia steppe and Xinjiang Autonomous Region, whereas pxmA methanotrophs mainly distributed in the Tibetan alpine steppe soil. Measured environmental variables explained the variations of CH4 oxidation potential well at both regional and sub-regional scales in these Chinese grassland ecosystems. However, the contributions of different variables to CH4 oxidation potential were scale-dependent. At the regional scale, total nitrogen (TN) was the environmental variable that best explained the potential CH4 oxidation rate, and its influence might be mainly associated with its effects on plant growth and methanotrophic community traits. At sub-regional scales, the main controlling variables were total organic carbon (TOC) and soil texture in Inner Mongolia steppe, aridity index (AI) and mean annual temperature (MAT) in Xinjiang Autonomous Region, and TN in Tibetan alpine steppe. These results further suggested that the impacts of environmental variables on CH4 oxidation rate were realized either through their effects on methanotrophic communities, and/or by affecting soil properties in the grassland ecosystems.

Their biosurfactants and degradation enzymes have been in the spotlight, mainly due to the awareness of ecosystem pollution caused by crude oil accidents and their use. Initially, the scientific community studied the role of individual microbial species by characterizing and optimizing their biosurfactant and oil degradation genes, studying their individual distribution. However, with the advances in genomics, in particular with the use of New-Generation-Sequencing and Metagenomics, it is now possible to have a macro view of the complex pathways related to the symbiotic degradation of hydrocarbons and surfactant production. It is now possible, although more challenging, to obtain the DNA information of an entire microbial community before automatically characterizing it. By characterizing and understanding the interconnected role of microorganisms and the role of degradation and biosurfactant genes in an ecosystem, it becomes possible to develop new biotechnological approaches for bioremediation use. This paper analyzes 46 different metagenome samples, spanning 20 biomes from different geographies obtained from different research projects. Results: A metagenomics bioinformatics pipeline, focused on the biodegradation and biosurfactant-production pathways, genes and organisms, was applied. Our main results show that: (1) surfactation and degradation are correlated events, and therefore should be studied together; (2) terrestrial biomes present more degradation genes, especially cyclic compounds, and less surfactation genes, when compared to water biomes; and (3) latitude has a significant influence on the diversity of genes involved in biodegradation and biosurfactant production. This suggests that microbiomes found near the equator are richer in genes that have a role in these processes and thus have a higher biotechnological potential. Conclusion: In this work we have focused on the biogeographical distribution of hydrocarbon degrading and biosurfactant producing genes. Our principle results can be seen as an important step forward in the application of bioremediation techniques, by considering the biostimulation, optimization or manipulation of a starting microbial consortia from the areas with higher degradation and biosurfactant producing genetic diversity.",2017,17,10.1186/s12866-017-1077-4

Yet, the microbial communities associated with invasive plants are generally poorly understood. Here we report on the first comprehensive investigation of the bacterial and fungal communities inhabiting the rhizosphere and the surrounding bulk soil of a widespread invasive tree, Acacia dealbata. Amplicon sequencing data indicated that rhizospheric microbial communities differed significantly in structure and composition from those of the bulk soil. Two bacterial (Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria) and two fungal (Pezizomycetes and Agaricomycetes) classes were enriched in the rhizosphere compared with bulk soils. Changes in nutritional status, possibly induced by A. dealbata, primarily shaped rhizosphere soil communities. Despite a high degree of geographic variability in the diversity and composition of microbial communities, invasive A. dealbata populations shared a core of bacterial and fungal taxa, some of which are known to be involved in N and P cycling, while others are regarded as plant pathogens. Shotgun metagenomic analysis also showed that several functional genes related to plant growth promotion were overrepresented in the rhizospheres of A. dealbata. Overall, results suggest that rhizosphere microbes may contribute to the widespread success of this invader in novel environments.",2017,7,10.1038/s41598-017-07018-w

However, little is known about the oxidative weathering of inactive sulfide chimneys, nor about associated microbial community structures and their succession during this weathering process. In this work, an inactive sulfide chimney and a young chimney in the early sulfate stage of formation were collected from the Main Endeavor Field of the Juan de Fuca Ridge. To assess oxidative weathering, the ultrastructures of secondary alteration products accumulating on the chimney surface were examined and the presence of possible Fe-oxidizing bacteria (FeOB) was investigated. The results of ultrastructure observation revealed that FeOB-associated ultrastructures with indicative morphologies were abundantly present. Iron oxidizers primarily consisted of members closely related to Gallionella spp. and Mariprofundus spp., indicating Fe-oxidizing species likely promote the oxidative weathering of inactive sulfide chimneys. Abiotic accumulation of Fe-rich substances further indicates that oxidative weathering is a complex, dynamic process, alternately controlled by FeOB and by abiotic oxidization. Although hydrothermal fluid flow had ceased, inactive chimneys still accommodate an abundant and diverse microbiome whose microbial composition and metabolic potential dramatically differ from their counterparts at active vents. Bacterial lineages within current inactive chimney are dominated by members of alpha-, delta-, and gamma-Proteobacteria and they are deduced to be closely involved in a diverse set of geochemical processes including iron oxidation, nitrogen fixation, ammonia oxidation and denitrification. At last, by examining microbial communities within hydrothermal chimneys at different formation stages, a general microbial community succession can be deduced from early formation stages of a sulfate chimney to actively mature sulfide structures, and then to the final inactive altered sulfide chimney. Our findings provide valuable insights into the microbe-involved oxidative weathering process and into microbial succession occurring at inactive hydrothermal sulfide chimney after high-temperature hydrothermal fluids have ceased venting.",2017,8,10.3389/fmicb.2017.01378

Recent climatic history has strongly impacted plant populations, but little is known about its effect on microbes. Alders, which host few and specific symbionts, have high genetic diversity in glacial refugia. Here, we tested the prediction that communities of root symbionts survived in refugia with their host populations. We expected to detect endemic symbionts and a higher species richness in refugia as compared to recolonized areas. Methods. We sampled ectomycorrhizal (EM) root tips and the nitrogen -fixing actin mycete Frankia communities in eight sites colonized by Alnus glutinosa insubsp. barbata close to the Caucasus in Georgia. Three sites were located the Colchis, one major Eurasian climatic refugia for Arcto-Tertiary flora and alders, and five sites were located in the recolonized zone. Endemic symbionts and plant ITS variants were detected by comparing sequences to published data from Europe and another Tertiary reftigium, the Hyrcanian forest. Species richness and community structure were compared between sites from refugia and recolonized areas for each symbionts. Results. For both symbionts, most MOTUs present in Georgia had been found previously elsewhere in Europe, Three endemic Frankia strains were detected in the Colchis vs two in the recolonized zone, and the five endemic EM fungi were detected only in the recolonized zone. Frankia species richness was higher in the Colchis while the contrary was observed for EM fungi. Moreover, the genetic diversity of one alder specialist Alnicola xanthophylla was particularly high in the recolonized zone. The EM communities occurring in the Colchis and the IHyrcanian forests shared closely related endemic species. Discussion, The Colchis did not have the highest alpha diversity and more endemic species, suggesting that our hypothesis based on alder biogeography may not apply to alders symbionts. Our study in the Caucasus brings new clues to understand symbioses biogeography and their survival in Tertiary and ice -age refugia, and reveals that isolated host populations could be of interest for symbiont diversity conservation.",2017,5,10.7717/peerj.3479

Their plasmids contain ecologically crucial functional modules of up to similar to 40-kb in size, e.g., for aerobic anoxygenic photosynthesis, flagellar formation and the biosynthesis of the antibiotic tropodithietic acid. Furthermore, the widely present type four secretion system (T4SS) of roseobacters has been shown to mediate conjugation across genus barriers, albeit in the laboratory. Here we discovered that Confluentimicrobium naphthalenivorans NS6(T), a tidal flat bacterium isolated in Korea, carries a 185-kb plasmid, which exhibits a long-range synteny with the conjugative 126-kb plasmid of Dinoroseobacter shibae DFL12(T). Both replicons are stably maintained by RepABC operons of the same compatibility group (-2) and they harbor a homologous T4SS. Principal component analysis of the codon usage shows a large similarity between the two plasmids, while the chromosomes are very distinct, showing that neither of the two bacterial species represents the original host of those RepABC-2 type plasmids. The two species do not share a common habitat today and they are phylogenetically only distantly related.

Whether and how environmental change will propagate into methanogenic assemblages of natural environments remains largely unknown owing to a poor understanding of global distribution patterns and environmental drivers of this specific group of microorganisms. In this study, we performed a meta-analysis targeting the biogeographic patterns and environmental controls of methanogenic communities using 94 public mcrA gene datasets. We show a global pattern of methanogenic archaea that is more associated with habitat filtering than with geographical dispersal. We identify salinity as the control on methanogenic community composition at global scale whereas pH and temperature are the major controls in non-saline soils and lakes. The importance of salinity for structuring methanogenic community composition is also reflected in the biogeography of methanogenic lineages and the physiological properties of methanogenic isolates. Linking methanogenic alpha-diversity with reported values of methane emission identifies estuaries as the most diverse methanogenic habitats with, however, minor contribution to the global methane budget. With salinity, temperature and pH our study identifies environmental drivers of methanogenic community composition facing drastic changes in many natural environments at the moment. However, consequences of this for the production of methane remain elusive owing to a lack of studies that combine methane production rate with community analysis.",2017,8,10.3389/fmicb.2017.01339

To address this, we applied whole-genome metagenomics to eight geographically distributed soils at opposing ends of a landscape soil pH gradient (where low-pH is similar to pH 4.3 and high-pH is similar to pH 8.3) and evaluated functional differences with respect to functionally annotated genes. First, differences in taxonomic and functional diversity between the two pH categories were assessed with respect to alpha diversity (mean sample richness) and gamma diversity (total richness pooled for each pH category). Low-pH soils, also exhibiting higher organic matter and moisture, consistently had lower taxonomic alpha and gamma diversity, but this was not apparent in assessments of functional alpha and gamma diversity. However, coherent changes in the relative abundances of annotated genes between low-and high-pH soils were identified; with strong multivariate clustering of samples according to pH independent of geography. Assessment of indicator genes revealed that the acidic organic-rich soils possessed a greater abundance of cation efflux pumps, C and N direct fixation systems, and fermentation pathways, indicating adaptations to both acidity and anaerobiosis. Conversely, high-pH soils possessed more direct transporter-mediated mechanisms for organic C and N substrate acquisition. These findings highlight the distinctive physiological adaptations required for bacteria to survive in soils of various nutrient availability and edaphic conditions and more generally indicate that bacterial functional versatility with respect to functional gene annotations may not be constrained by taxonomy. IMPORTANCE Over a set of soil samples spanning Britain, the widely reported reductions in bacterial taxonomic richness at low pH were found not to be accompanied by significant reductions in the richness of functional genes. However, consistent changes in the abundance of related functional genes were observed, characteristic of differential ecological and nutrient acquisition strategies between high-pH mineral soils and low-pH organic anaerobic soils. Our assessment at opposing ends of a soil gradient encapsulates the limits of functional diversity in temperate climates and identifies key pathways that may serve as indicators for soil element cycling and C storage processes in other soil systems. To this end, we make available a data set identifying functional indicators of the different soils; as well as raw sequences, which given the geographic scale of our sampling should be of value in future studies assessing novel genetic diversity of a wide range of soil functional attributes.",2017,8,10.1128/mBio.00799-17

While the initial meetings in the 2000s focused still mainly on palaeoecology and bioindication, the modern ones tend to address a wider panel of topics and cover most of the important research interests in organismal biology. Indeed, the future of testate amoebae research seems to be bright, as the meeting was teeming with new ideas and research direction that will further expand the field. The meeting was organized by the Laboratory of Evolutionary Protistology headed by Daniel J. G. Lahr, University of Sao Paulo with the help of the Sociedade Brasileira de Protozoologia (SBPz). The book of abstracts is available on the ISTAR website (http://istar.wikidot.com/meetings). The conference was divided by subject fields: Taxonomy, Palaeontology, Ecology and General Biology.

"Zhang, XX; Guo, HJ; Jiao, J; Zhang, P; Xiong, HY; Chen, WX; Tian, CF",Pyrosequencing of rpoB uncovers a significant biogeographical pattern of rhizobial species in soybean rhizosphere,JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY,"AimMost culture-independent studies of bacterial biogeography have been at genus or higher taxonomic levels, although many important processes mediated by bacteria are at the strain or species level, such as the competitive nodulation of rhizobia on legumes. Here, at the intra-species level, we characterized the structural variation in rhizobial populations in soybean rhizosphere under field conditions across 32 sampling sites in three eco-regions. LocationNorth-east (Heilongjiang), north (Hebei-Shandong) and south (Jiangxi) China. MethodsThe intra-species diversity of rhizobia in soybean rhizospheres was investigated by rpoB pyrosequencing. Soybean nodule isolates were characterized using repetitive extragenic palindromic PCR, restriction fragment length polymorphism of 16S-23S intergenic sequences and rpoB PCR sequencing. Patterns and processes of biogeography of identified rhizobia were studied. ResultsSignificant biogeographical patterns of rhizosphere rhizobia at the species level were found, and the abundant species in the rhizosphere were generally the dominant microsymbionts in soybean nodules. The distribution of rhizobial species in the rhizosphere across eco-regions correlated with combined effects of spatial, vegetative, edaphic and climatic variables. Gene flow and genetic differentiation analyses revealed that there was no dispersal limitation among geographical populations of the same rhizobial species, and drift or subsequent diversification might be involved in shaping the biogeographical pattern in addition to environmental factors. Main conclusionsThese results constitute the first report of the existence of rhizobial biogeography in legume rhizospheres at the species level, contrasting with most studies, which focused on nodule isolates. The method developed in this study could be used to uncover, at high resolution, the diversity of local rhizobial populations in soils. This information is crucial for choosing suitable strains or species as inoculants for a specific legume host under local field conditions. Moreover, a similar strategy could be used to study other bacteria with important ecological functions.",2017,44,10.1111/jbi.12891

Although microbes have irreplaceable roles in various ecosystems, the spatial variation in microbial communities has received less attention in comparison to macro-organisms. Studies aiming to disentangle the effects of local environmental, catchment and climatic variables on microbial communities are also rare. Here, we disentangled the effects of local, catchment, spatial and climatic variables on boreal stream diatom and bacterial communities. LocationWestern Finland MethodsWe sampled 21 boreal river basins comprising 105 study sites spanning 520km in north-south direction and 330km in east-west direction in western Finland. We used principal coordinates of neighbour matrix analysis (PCNM), redundancy analyses (RDA), variation partitioning, boosted regression trees (BRT) and regression analyses to examine variation in community composition and species richness. ResultsWater chemistry and physical variables had significant effects on the community composition of both microbial groups. Catchment level variables explained a slightly larger amount of variation in diatom community composition than local level variables. Agriculture was the most significant determinant of variation in diatom community composition among catchment level variables and was also related with variation in the richness of both groups. Of spatial and climatic variables, growing degree days (GDD) and spatial variables were the most significant drivers determining diatom community composition. GDD was also positively associated with the richness of diatoms and bacteria. Unique effects of spatial and climate variables accounted for the largest amount of variation in the community composition of both diatoms and bacteria. Main conclusionsOur results highlight that aquatic microbial communities can exhibit biogeographical variation at regional scales due to the joint influence of local, catchment and climatic variables, and possibly because of dispersal limitation. Catchment properties, especially agriculture, can be used as a proxy for the effects of landscape alteration on aquatic microbial communities.",2017,44,10.1111/jbi.13002
"Hendershot, JN; Read, QD; Henning, JA; Sanders, NJ; Classen, AT",Consistently inconsistent drivers of microbial diversity and abundance at macroecological scales,ECOLOGY,"Macroecology seeks to understand broad-scale patterns in the diversity and abundance of organisms, but macroecologists typically study aboveground macroorganisms. Belowground organisms regulate numerous ecosystem functions, yet we lack understanding of what drives their diversity. Here, we examine the controls on belowground diversity along latitudinal and elevational gradients. We performed a global meta-analysis of 325 soil communities across 20 studies conducted along temperature and soil pH gradients. Belowground taxa, whether bacterial or fungal, observed along a given gradient of temperature or soil pH were equally likely to show a linear increase, linear decrease, humped pattern, trough-shaped pattern, or no pattern in diversity along the gradient. Land-use intensity weakly affected the diversity-temperature relationship, but no other factor did so. Our study highlights disparities among diversity patterns of soil microbial communities. Belowground diversity may be controlled by the associated climatic and historical contexts of particular gradients, by factors not typically measured in community-level studies, or by processes operating at scales that do not match the temporal and spatial scales under study. Because these organisms are responsible for a suite of key processes, understanding the drivers of their distribution and diversity is fundamental to understanding the functioning of ecosystems.",2017,98,10.1002/ecy.1829

Continental scale patterns in the composition and functioning of microbial communities are related to climatic, biotic, and edaphic factors such as temperature and precipitation, plant community composition, and soil carbon, nitrogen, and pH. Although these relationships have been well explored individually, the examination of the factors that may act directly on microbial communities vs. those that may act indirectly through other ecosystem properties has not been well developed. To further such understanding, we utilized structural equation modeling (SEM) to evaluate a set of hypotheses about the direct and indirect effects of climatic, biotic, and edaphic variables on microbial communities across the continental United States. The primary goals of this work were to test our current understanding of the interactions among climate, soils, and plants in affecting microbial community composition, and to examine whether variation in the composition of the microbial community affects potential rates of soil enzymatic activities. A model of interacting factors created through SEM shows several expected patterns. Distal factors such as climate had indirect effects on microbial communities by influencing plant productivity, soil mineralogy, and soil pH, but factors related to soil organic matter chemistry had the most direct influence on community composition. We observed that both plant productivity and soil mineral composition were important indirect influences on community composition at the continental scale, both interacting to affect organic matter content and microbial biomass and ultimately community composition. Although soil hydrolytic enzymes were related to the moisture regime and soil carbon, oxidative enzymes were also affected by community composition, reflected in the abundance of soil fungi. These results highlight that soil microbial communities can be modeled within the context of multiple interacting ecosystem properties acting both directly and indirectly on their composition and function, and this provides a rich and informative context with which to examine communities. This work also highlights that variation in climate, microbial biomass, and microbial community composition can affect maximum rates of soil enzyme activities, potentially influencing rates of decomposition and nutrient mineralization in soils.",2017,98,10.1002/ecy.1883
"Oono, R; Rasmussen, A; Lefevre, E",Distance decay relationships in foliar fungal endophytes are driven by rare taxa,ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY,"Foliar fungal endophytes represent a diverse and species-rich plant microbiome. Their biogeography provides essential clues to their cryptic relationship with hosts and the environment in which they disperse. We present species composition, diversity, and dispersal patterns of endophytic fungi associated with needles of Pinus taeda trees across regional scales in the absence of strong environmental gradients as well as within individual trees. An empirical designation of rare and abundant taxa enlightens us on the structure of endophyte communities. We report multiple distance-decay patterns consistent with effects of dispersal limitation, largely driven by community changes in rare taxa, those taxonomic units that made up less than 0.31% of reads per sample on average. Distance-decay rates and community structure also depended on specific classes of fungi and were predominantly influenced by rare members of Dothideomycetes. Communities separated by urban areas also revealed stronger effects of distance on community similarity, confirming that host density and diversity plays an important role in symbiont biogeography, which may ultimately lead to a mosaic of functional diversity as well as rare species diversity across landscapes.",2017,19,10.1111/1462-2920.13799

We assessed soil fungal diversity and community composition of five Chinese zonal forests along a latitudinal gradient spanning 23 degrees N to 42 degrees N in three seasons to address these questions. We found that soil fungal diversity increased linearly or parabolically with latitude. The seasonal variations in fungal diversity were more distinguishable in three temperate deciduous forests than in two subtropical evergreen forests. Soil fungal diversity was mainly correlated with edaphic factors such as pH and nutrient contents. Both latitude and its interactions with season also imposed significant impacts on soil fungal community composition (FCC), but the effects of latitude were stronger than those of season. Vegetational properties such as plant diversity and forest age were the dominant factors affecting FCC in the subtropical evergreen forests while edaphic properties were the dominant ones in the temperate deciduous forests. Our results indicate that latitudinal variation patterns of soil fungal diversity and FCC may differ among seasons. The stronger effect of latitude relative to that of season suggests a more important influence by the spatial than temporal heterogeneity in shaping soil fungal communities across zonal forests.",2017,93,10.1093/femsec/fix069

LocationThe southern Appalachian Mountains, USA. MethodsWe conducted fine-scale population-level sampling and screening of DNA sequence variation in two mitochondrial genes from the host, and four genic or intergenic regions from the endosymbiont. Inferences were made using analyses that have the potential to identify isolated instances of cophylogenetic discord, uncover subtle differences in geographic locations of genetic discontinuities, and disentangle different evolutionary processes that contributed to observed patterns. ResultsThe host and its endosymbiont showed similar phylogenetic and geographic patterns. Cophylogenetic analyses revealed that while topological discord is rare (and restricted within major clades), some instances are potentially non-negligible. Assessments of spatial-genetic structure showed that most abrupt breaks occur in the same locations, but they differ in strength, again underscoring some subtle discordance. The main process generating observed patterns was inferred to be codivergence due to host-tracking; however, incomplete lineage sorting seems likely to have also played a minor role. Main conclusionsOur overarching finding of strong congruence is reflected by broader-scale cophylogenetic studies of related Cryptocercus and Blattabacterium taxa. Accordingly, we suggest that members of this symbiosis may provide an excellent opportunity for investigating geographic scaling of processes that affect biogeographic patterns. However, fine-scale sampling coupled with geospatial analyses detected rare and/or minor discordances that appeared to be localized within the most deeply dissected topographic regions of the southern Appalachian Mountains, and these warrant further exploration.",2017,44,10.1111/jbi.12992
"Ross, AA; Doxey, AC; Neufeld, JD",The Skin Microbiome of Cohabiting Couples,MSYSTEMS,"Distinct microbial communities inhabit individuals as part of the human skin microbiome and are continually shed to the surrounding environment. Microbial communities from 17 skin sites of 10 sexually active cohabiting couples (20 individuals) were sampled to test whether cohabitation impacts an individuals skin microbiome, leading to shared skin microbiota among partner pairs. Amplified 16S rRNA genes of bacteria and archaea from a total of 340 skin swabs were analyzed by high-throughput sequencing, and the results demonstrated that cohabitation was significantly associated with microbial community composition, although this association was greatly exceeded by characteristics of body location and individuality. Random forest modeling demonstrated that the partners could be predicted 86% of the time (P < 0.001) based on their skin microbiome profiles, which was always greater than combinations of incorrectly matched partners. Cohabiting couples had the most similar overall microbial skin communities on their feet, according to BrayCurtis distances. In contrast, thigh microbial communities were strongly associated with biological sex rather than cohabiting partner. Additional factors that were associated with the skin microbiome of specific body locations included the use of skin care products, pet ownership, allergies, and alcohol consumption. These baseline data identified links between the skin microbiome and daily interactions among cohabiting individuals, adding to known factors that shape the human microbiome and, by extension, its relation to human health. IMPORTANCE Our work characterizes the influence of cohabitation as a factor influencing the composition of the skin microbiome. Although the body site and sampled individual were stronger influences than other factors collected as metadata in this study, we show that modeling of detected microbial taxa can help with correct identifications of cohabiting partners based on skin microbiome profiles using machine learning approaches. These results show that a cohabiting partner can significantly influence our microbiota. Follow-up studies will be important for investigating the implications of shared microbiota on dermatological health and the contributions of cohabiting parents to the microbiome profiles of their infants.",2017,2,10.1128/mSystems.00043-17

However, their biogeographic distribution patterns along combined gradients of plant communities and environmental variables across regional spatial scales remain poorly understood. This knowledge gap is particularly pronounced in arid and semi-arid grassland ecosystems, which occupy one third of the terrestrial surface of China. Here, a regional-scale field investigation was conducted to collect soil samples from 290 plots at 52 sites along a 4000 km transect in temperate grasslands of northern China to assess the distribution patterns of fungal communities. The high-throughput Illumina sequencing revealed that soil fungal communities were dominated by Ascomycota, Basidiomycota and Zygomycota across the temperate grasslands. Fungal richness increased with plant species richness and mean annual precipitation (MAP). Bray-Cutis dissimilarities in soil fungal community composition between sites were significantly correlated with plant community composition, geographical distance, and abiotic factors including MAP, mean annual temperature, soil pH, and soil organic carbon. Variation partitioning analysis revealed that variation in fungal community composition was mainly explained by plant community composition, followed by geographical distance and abiotic factors. Structural equation models further highlighted the significant role of plant species richness in determining soil fungal richness. Taken together, these results suggest that the regional-scale distribution pattern of soil fungal communities is predominantly mediated by plant community composition, and also by abiotic factors and geographical distance in arid and semi-arid temperate grasslands.

"Aizenberg-Gershtein, Y; Izhaki, I; Halpern, M",From Microhabitat of Floral Nectar Up to Biogeographic Scale: Novel Insights on Neutral and Niche Bacterial Assemblies,MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,"Microbial model systems are very useful in addressing macro-ecological questions. Two major theories exist to date, to explain the community structure of organisms: (1) the dispersal (neutral) assembly theory which predicts that community similarity decreases with increasing geographic distance, independent of any environmental variables, and (2) the niche assembly theory which predicts that the communities compositions are more homogeneous among sites characterized by similar environmental conditions. Our study system offered a unique opportunity to investigate the relative role of environmental conditions and spatial factors in shaping community composition. We explored the bacterial community composition (BCC) of Nicotiana glauca floral nectar using the Illumina MiSeq technique at three spatial scales (plants, site, and region) and two taxonomic levels. Floral nectar samples were collected from 69 N. glauca plants at 11 different sites along a 200-km transect in Israel, along three biogeographic regions. A distance decay of BCC was found among all plants throughout Israel, but such pattern was not found among either sites or biogeographical regions. The BCC was also governed by environmental conditions in all examined scales (from the plant up to the biogeographical region). We also found that taxonomic resolution (89 and 97% sequence identity for clustering operational taxonomic units) affected the results of these BCC analyses. Hence, our study revealed that the BCC in N. glauca floral nectar is shaped by both the environmental conditions and the distance between plants, depending on the sampling scale under examination as well as by taxonomic resolution.",2017,74,10.1007/s00248-017-0935-9

We determined the community composition of microbial eukaryotes in an Arctic under-ice spring bloom north of Svalbard using metabarcoding of DNA and RNA from the hypervariable V4 region of 18S nrDNA. At the two stations studied, the photosynthetic biomass was dominated by protists >3 mu m and was concentrated in the upper 7080 m, above the thermocline and halocline. Hierarchical cluster analyses as well as ordination analyses showed a distinct clustering of the microbial eukaryote communities according to a combination of water mass and local environmental characteristics. While samples collected in the surface mixed layer differed distinctly between the two sites, the deeper communities collected in Atlantic Water were fairly similar despite being geographically distant. The differentiation of the microbial eukaryote communities of the upper mixed water was probably driven by local development and advection, while the lack of such differentiation in the communities of Atlantic Water reflects the homogenizing effect of water currents on microbial communities.",2017,8,10.3389/fmicb.2017.01099
"Nunan, N; Leloup, J; Ruamps, LS; Pouteau, V; Chenu, C",Effects of habitat constraints on soil microbial community function,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,"An underlying assumption of most soil carbon (C) dynamics models is that soil microbial communities are functionally similar; in other words, that microbial activity under given conditions is not dependent on the composition or diversity of the communities. Although a number of studies have indicated that microbial communities are not intrinsically functionally similar, most soil C dynamics models can adequately describe C dynamics without explicitly describing microbial functioning. Here, we provide a mechanistic basis for reconciling this apparent discrepancy. In a reciprocal transplant experiment, we show that the environmental context (soil and pore-network properties) of microbial communities can constrain the activity of functionally different communities to such an extent that their activities are indistinguishable. The data also suggest that when microbial activity is less constrained, the intrinsic functional differences among communities can be expressed. We conclude that soil C dynamics may depend on microbial community structure or diversity in environments where their activity is less constrained, such as the rhizosphere or the litter layer, but not in oligotrophic environments such as the mineral layers of soil.",2017,7,10.1038/s41598-017-04485-z

As we know, an ideal molecular marker used in molecular identification and phylogenetic studies is homogeneous within species, and interspecific variation exceeds intraspecific variation. However, during our process of performing ITS, RPB2, and EF1a sequencing on the Pleurotus spp., we found that intra-isolate sequence polymorphism might be present in these genes because direct sequencing of PCR products failed in some isolates. Therefore, we detected intra-and inter-isolate variation of the three genes in Pleurotus by polymerase chain reaction amplification and cloning in this study. Results: Results showed that intra-isolate variation of ITS was not uncommon but the polymorphic level in each isolate was relatively low in Pleurotus; intra-isolate variations of EF1a and RPB2 sequences were present in an unexpectedly high amount. The polymorphism level differed significantly between ITS, RPB2, and EF1a in the same individual, and the intra-isolate heterogeneity level of each gene varied between isolates within the same species. Intra-isolate and intraspecific variation of ITS in the tested isolates was less than interspecific variation, and intra-isolate and intraspecific variation of RPB2 was probably equal with interspecific divergence. Meanwhile, intra-isolate and intraspecific variation of EF1a could exceed interspecific divergence. These findings suggested that RPB2 and EF1a are not desirable barcoding candidates for Pleurotus. We also discussed the reason why rDNA and protein-coding genes showed variants within a single isolate in Pleurotus, but must be addressed in further research. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that intra-isolate variation of ribosomal and protein-coding genes are likely widespread in fungi. This has implications for studies on fungal evolution, taxonomy, phylogenetics, and population genetics. More extensive sampling of these genes and other candidates will be required to ensure reliability as phylogenetic markers and DNA barcodes.",2017,17,10.1186/s12866-017-1046-y

With the advent of rapid, high throughput, next generation sequencing, there is a growing appreciation of the importance of commensal microbial populations in maintaining mucosal health, and a realization that bacteria colonize anatomical locations that were previously considered to be sterile. While upper respiratory tract microbial populations have been described, there are currently no published studies describing the normal microbial populations of the bovine lower respiratory tract. Consequently, we have little understanding of the relationship between upper and lower respiratory tract microbiota in healthy cattle. The primary objective of our study was to characterize the composition, structure and relationship of the lower and upper respiratory microbial communities in clinically healthy feedlot cattle. Nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS), and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, were collected from clinically healthy feedlot calves (n = 8). Genomic DNA from each sample was extracted, and the V3-V4 hypervariable region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced using Illumina Miseq platform. Results: Across all samples, the most predominant phyla were Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Firmicutes. The most common genera were Rathayibacter, Mycoplasma, Bibersteinia and Corynebacterium. The microbial community structure was distinct between these two biogeographical sites. Most of the bacterial genera identified in the BAL samples were also present in the NPS, but biogeographical-specific genera were enriched in both the NPS (Rathayibacter) and BAL (Bibersteinia) samples. There were strong associations between the presence of certain taxa at each specific location, and strong correlations between the presence of specific taxa in both the NPS and BAL samples. Conclusions: The correlation between the presence of specific taxa in both the NPS and BAL samples, supports the notion of a mutualistic interrelationship between these microbial communities. Future studies, in large cohorts of animals, are needed to determine the role and clinical importance of the relationships of respiratory tract microbial communities with health, productivity, and susceptibility to the development of respiratory disease, in growing cattle.",2017,17,10.1186/s12866-017-1042-2

Functional gene diversity and the structure of the microbial community determines its metabolic potential and therefore its ecological function in the marine ecosystem. However, little is known about the functional gene composition and metabolic potential of bacterioplankton in estuary areas. The East China Sea (ECS) is a dynamic marginal ecosystem in the western Pacific Ocean that is mainly affected by input from the Changjiang River and the Kuroshio Current. Here, using a high-throughput functional gene microarray (GeoChip), we analyzed the functional gene diversity, composition, structure, and metabolic potential of microbial assemblages in different ECS water masses. Four water masses determined by temperature and salinity relationship showed different patterns of functional gene diversity and composition. Generally, functional gene diversity [Shannon-Weaners H and reciprocal of Simpsons 1/(1-D)] in the surface water masses was higher than that in the bottom water masses. The different presence and proportion of functional genes involved in C, N, and P cycling among the bacteria of the different water masses showed different metabolic preferences of the microbial populations in the ECS. Genes involved in starch metabolism (amyA and nplT) showed higher proportion in microbial communities of the surface water masses than of the bottom water masses. In contrast, a higher proportion of genes involved in chitin degradation was observed in microorganisms of the bottom water masses. Moreover, we found a higher proportion of nitrogen fixation (nifH), transformation of hydroxylamine to nitrite (hao) and ammonification (gdh) genes in the microbial communities of the bottom water masses compared with those of the surface water masses. The spatial variation of microbial functional genes was significantly correlated with salinity, temperature, and chlorophyll a based on canonical correspondence analysis, suggesting a significant influence of hydrologic conditions on water microbial communities.

To reveal the responses of bacterial communities to long-term switchgrass cultivation through the soil profile, we examined the shift of soil microbial communities with depth profiles of 0-60 cm in five-year switchgrass cultivation and fallow plots. The Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene showed that switchgrass cultivation significantly increased microbial OTU richness, rather than microbial Shannon diversity; however, there was no significant difference in the structure of microbial communities between switchgrass cultivation and fallow soils. Both switchgrass cultivation and fallow soils exhibited significant negative vertical spatial decay of microbial similarity, indicating that more vertical depth distant soils had more dissimilar communities. Specifically, switchgrass cultivation soils showed more beta-diversity variations across soil depth profile. Through network analysis, more connections and closer relationships of microbial taxa were observed in soils under switchgrass cultivation, suggesting that microbial co-occurrence patterns were substantially influenced by switchgrass cultivation. Overall, our study suggested that five-year switchgrass cultivation could generated more beta-diversity variations across soil depth and more complex inter-relationships of microbial taxa, although did not significantly shape the structure of soil microbial community.",2017,7,10.1038/s41598-017-03778-7

While great progress has been made in describing this diversity, it remains difficult to identify the phylogenetic and ecological characteristics that delineate groups of bacteria that possess species-like properties. One major challenge associated with species delineations is that not all shared genes have the same evolutionary history, and thus the choice of loci can have a major impact on phylogenetic reconstruction. Sequencing the genomes of large numbers of closely related strains provides new opportunities to distinguish ancestral from acquired alleles and assess the effects of recombination on phylogenetic inference. Here we analyzed the genomes of 119 strains of the marine actinomycete genus Salinispora, which is currently comprised of three named species that share 99% 16S rRNA gene sequence identity. While 63% of the core genome showed evidence of recombination, this had no effect on species-level phylogenomic resolution. Recombination did however blur intra-species relationships and biogeographic resolution. The genome-wide average nucleotide identity provided a new perspective on Salinispora diversity, revealing as many as seven new species.

The range of Shannon diversities (10.27-10.58) showed considerably smaller variation than what was previously observed at ungrazed sites nearby (9.95-10.65), suggesting the important role of livestock grazing on microbial diversities. Closer examination showed that the dissimilarity of microbial community at our study sites increased with elevations, revealing an elevation-decay relationship of microbial functional genes. Both microbial functional diversity and the number of unique genes increased with elevations. Furthermore, we detected a tight linkage of greenhouse gas (CO2) and relative abundances of carbon cycling genes. Our biogeographic study provides insights on microbial functional diversity and soil biogeochemical cycling in Tibetan pastures.",2017,8,10.3389/fmicb.2017.00976

Current knowledge of primary succession is mainly from studies of vegetation dynamics, whereas information about belowground microbes remains unclear. Here, we combined shifts in community assembly processes with microbial primary succession to better understand mechanisms governing the stochastic/deterministic balance. We investigated fungal succession and community assembly via high-throughput sequencing along a well-established glacier forefront chronosequence that spans 2-188 years of deglaciation. Shannon diversity and evenness peaked at a distance of 370m and declined afterwards. The response of fungal diversity to distance varied in different phyla. Basidiomycota Shannon diversity significantly decreased with distance, while the pattern of Rozellomycota Shannon diversity was unimodal. Abundance of most frequencies OTU2 (Cryptococcus terricola) increased with successional distance, whereas that of OTU65 (Tolypocladium tundrense) decreased. Based on null deviation analyses, composition of the fungal community was initially governed by deterministic processes strongly but later less deterministic processes. Our results revealed that distance, altitude, soil microbial biomass carbon, soil microbial biomass nitrogen and NH4+N significantly correlated with fungal community composition along the chronosequence. These results suggest that the drivers of fungal community are dynamics in a glacier chronosequence, that may relate to fungal ecophysiological traits and adaptation in an evolving ecosystem. The information will provide understanding the mechanistic underpinnings of microbial community assembly during ecosystem succession under different scales and scenario.",2017,8,10.3389/fmicb.2017.01028

Here, we assess how many marine species are named and estimated to exist, paying particular regard to whether discoveries of deep-sea organisms, microbes and parasites will change the proportion of terrestrial to marine species. We then review what factors have led to species diversification, and how this knowledge informs conservation priorities. The implications of this understanding for marine conservation are that the species most vulnerable to extinction will be large and endemic. Unfortunately, these species are also the most threatened by human impacts.

Coastal lakes are recipients of, and thus are connected to, both marine and terrestrial environments. Thus, they may host microbial assemblages that reflect the relative degree of influence by, and connectivity to, either system. In order to address this idea, we interrogated microbial community diversity at 49 sites in seven ponds in two seasons in the Lake MacLeod basin, a system fed by seawater flowing inland through underground karst. Environmental and spatial variation within ponds explain <9% of the community structure, while identity of the pond that samples were taken from explains 50% of community variation. That is, ponds each host distinct assemblages despite similarities in size, environment and position in the landscape, indicating a dominant role for local species sorting. The ponds contain a substantial amount of previously unknown microbial taxa, reflecting the unusual nature of this inland system. Rare marine taxa, possibly dispersed from seawater assemblages via the underground karst connection, are abundant within the inland system, suggesting an important role for regional dispersal within the metacommunities.",2017,93,10.1093/femsec/fix067

The presence of cryoconite material decreases surface albedo and accelerates glacier mass loss, a problem of particular importance in the rapidly melting Tibetan Plateau. No studies have addressed the microbial community composition of cryoconite holes and their associated ecosystem processes on Tibetan glaciers. To further enhance our understanding of these glacial ecosystems on the Tibetan Plateau and to examine their role in carbon cycling as the glaciers respond to climate change, we explored the bacterial communities within cryoconite holes associated with three climatically distinct Tibetan Plateau glaciers using Illumina sequencing of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Cryoconite bacterial communities were dominated by Cyanobacteria, Chloroflexi, Betaproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria. Cryoconite bacterial community composition varied according to their geographical locations, exhibiting significant differences among glaciers studied. Regional beta diversity was driven by the interaction between geographic distance and environmental variables; the latter contributed more than geographic distance to the variation in cryoconite microbial communities.

Recent work comparing three genome sequences of Sulfolobus acidocaldarius suggested that highly structured, extreme, hot spring environments do not limit dispersal of this thermoacidophile, in contrast to other co-occurring Sulfolobus species. Instead, a high level of conservation among these three S. acidocaldarius genomes was hypothesized to result from rapid, global-scale dispersal promoted by low susceptibility to viruses that sets S. acidocaldarius apart from its sister Sulfolobus species. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a comparative analysis of 47 genomes of S. acidocaldarius from spatial and temporal sampling of two hot springs in Yellowstone National Park. While we confirm the low diversity in the core genome, we observe differentiation among S. acidocaldarius populations, likely resulting from low migration among hot spring islands in Yellowstone National Park. Patterns of genomic variation indicate that differing geological contexts result in the elimination or preservation of diversity among differentiated populations. We observe multiple deletions associated with a large genomic island rich in glycosyltransferases, differential integrations of the Sulfolobus turreted icosahedral virus, as well as two different plasmid elements. These data demonstrate that neither rapid dispersal nor lack of mobile genetic elements result in low diversity in the S. acidocaldarius genomes. We suggest instead that significant differences in the recent evolutionary history, or the intrinsic evolutionary rates, of sister Sulfolobus species result in the relatively low diversity of the S. acidocaldarius genome.",2017,9,10.1093/gbe/evx104

Microorganisms on glaciers form consortia - cryoconite granules (cryoconites). They are granular/spherical mineral particles connected with archaea, cyanobacteria, heterotrophic bacteria, algae, fungi, and micro animals (mainly Tardigrada and Rotifera). Cryophilic organisms inhabiting glaciers have been studied in different aspects: from taxonomy, ecology and biogeography, to searching of biotechnological potentials and physiological strategies to survive in extreme glacial habitats. However, they have never been used in astrobiological experiments. The main aim of this paper is brief review of literature and supporting assumptions that cryoconite granules and microinvertebrates on glaciers, are promising models in astrobiology for looking for analogies and survival strategies in terms of icy planets and moons. So far, astrobiological research have been conducted on single strains of prokaryotes or microinvertebrates but never on a consortium of them. Due to the hypothetical similarity of glaciers on the Earth to those on other planets these cryoconites consortia of microorganisms and glacier microinvertebrates may be applied in astrobiological experiments instead of the limno-terrestrial ones used currently. Those consortia and animals have qualities to use them in such studies and they may be the key to understanding how organisms are able to survive, reproduce and remain active at low temperatures.",2017,6,10.1515/ctg-2017-0001

Some of these microorganisms are found to have immense industrial importance. Microbes generally exist in milieus of varying complexities and diversities. Attempting the usually employed cultivation-based techniques in experimentation with those microbes had confronted various limitations. To overcome these limitations a strategy based on high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicon analysis was employed for studying the differential diversity and the detailed nature of microbial population of the two hot springs of Bakreshwar (54 degrees C & 65 degrees C). Paired-end libraries of amplified V-3 hyper-variable 16S rDNA fragments from sets of samples that varied in their contents, ranging from a single bacterium to highly complex communities were sequenced. The comparison revealed the differential aspects in the two hot spring waters; the samples at 54 degrees C showed the bacterial phylum Firmicutes (65.85%) and Synergistetes (27.24%) predominating and those from hot spring water at 65 degrees C showed the abundance of the phyla Firmicutes (96.10%) and Proteobacteria (3.36%).

To understand such interactions in detail, we investigated how the salivary microbiome in the oral cavity would be regulated by host-related signals. Here, we show that the microbial abundance and gene participating in keeping the human salivary microbiome exhibit global circadian rhythm. Analysis of the 16S rRNA sequences of salivary microbial samples of six healthy adults collected at 4-h intervals for three days revealed that the microbial genera accounting for 68.4-89.6% of the total abundance were observed to significantly oscillate with the periodicity of 24 h. These oscillation patterns showed high variations amongst individuals, and the extent of circadian variations in individuals was generally lower than that of interindividual variations. Of the microbial categories oscillated, those classified by aerobic/anaerobic growth and Gram staining, Firmicutes including Streptococcus and Gemella, and Bacteroidetes including Prevotella showed high association with the circadian oscillation. The circadian oscillation was completely abolished by incubating the saliva in vitro, suggesting that hosts physiological changes mostly contributed to the microbial oscillation. Further metagenomic analysis showed that circadian oscillation enriched the functions of environmental responses such as various transporters and two-component regulatory systems in the evening, and those of metabolisms such as the biosynthesis of vitamins and fatty acids in the morning.",2017,24,10.1093/dnares/dsx001
"Pernthaler, J",Competition and niche separation of pelagic bacteria in freshwater habitats,ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY,"Freshwater bacterioplankton assemblages are composed of sympatric populations that can be delineated, for example, by ribosomal RNA gene relatedness and that differ in key ecophysiological properties. They may be free-living or attached, specialized for particular concentrations or subsets of substrates, or invest a variable amount of their resources in defence traits against protistan predators and viruses. Some may be motile and tactic whereas others are not, with far-reaching implications for their respective life styles and niche partitioning. The co-occurrence of competitors with overlapping growth requirements has profound consequences for the stability of community functions; it can to some extent be explained by habitat factors such as the microscale complexity and spatiotemporal variability of the lacustrine environments. On the other hand, the composition and diversity of freshwater microbial assemblages also reflects non-equilibrium states, dispersal and the stochasticity of community assembly processes. This review synoptically discusses the competition and niche separation of heterotrophic bacterial populations (defined at various levels of phylogenetic resolution) in the pelagic zone of inland surface waters from a variety of angles, focusing on habitat heterogeneity and the resulting biogeographic distribution patterns, the ecophysiological adaptations to the substrate field and the interactions of prokaryotes with predators and viruses.",2017,19,10.1111/1462-2920.13742

Here, we investigated the seasonal variation in the importance of dispersal from different sources (mixing, precipitation, surface runoff and sediment resuspension) for lake bacterioplankton community and population dynamics. For that purpose, two small forest lakes and their dispersal sources were sampled over a period of 10 months. The influence of dispersal on communities and populations was determined by 454 sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and SourceTracker analysis. On the community level direct effects of dispersal were questionable from all sources. Instead we found that the community of the preceding sampling occasion, representing growth of resident bacteria, was of great importance.

The results showed that with an increasing altitude gradient, soil physicochemical properties such as total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC), water-soluble organic nitrogen (WSON) and pH decreased coincident with a decrease in mean annual temperature (MAT). Bacteria biomass, fungal biomass and actinobacterial biomass all decreased with an increase in altitude gradient. The ratio of Gram-positive bacteria to Gram-negative bacteria and the ratio of cyclopropyl to precursor fatty acids all indicate that the level of environmental harshness intensified with an increase in altitude. We also found that soil enzyme activities such as phenol oxidase, peroxidase, L-asparaginase, protease, urease and alkaline phosphatase all consistently decreased with an increase in altitude gradient. Additionally, the activities of peroxidase, protease and alkaline phosphatase declined, mainly due to a reduction in enzyme activities with temperature rather than the reduction of associated microbial biomass. Statistical analysis showed that both microbial biomass and enzyme activities were significantly influenced by mean annual temperature, suggesting that temperature is a key factor that affects microbial communities and soil enzyme activities in alpine wetlands on the Tibetan Plateau and indicating that climate warming may significantly impact these areas.",2017,37,10.1007/s13157-017-0876-6

However, knowledge about patterns in microbial aerobiology is still relatively scarce, and this can be attributed, in part, to a lack of consensus on appropriate sampling and analytical methodology. In this study, three different methods were used to investigate aerial biodiversity over Svalbard: impaction, membrane filtration and drop plates. Sites around Svalbard were selected due to their relatively remote location, low human population, geographical location with respect to air movement and the tradition and history of scientific investigation on the archipelago, ensuring the presence of existing research infrastructure. The aerial bacterial biodiversity found was similar to that described in other aerobiological studies from both polar and non-polar environments, with Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes being the predominant groups. Twelve different phyla were detected in the air collected above Svalbard, although the diversity was considerably lower than in urban environments elsewhere. However, only 58 of 196 bacterial genera detected were consistently present, suggesting potentially higher levels of heterogeneity. Viable bacteria were present at all sampling locations, showing that living bacteria are ubiquitous in the air around Svalbard. Sampling location influenced the results obtained, as did sampling method.

LocationChesapeake Bay in Virginia (Port of Hampton Roads), Galveston Bay in Texas (Ports of Texas City, Houston and Bayport) and Prince William Sound in Alaska (Port of Valdez). MethodsWe collected 61 BW samples from 39 vessels from May to August 2013. We conducted amplicon-based high-throughput sequencing (HTS) using the hypervariable V4 domain of the small subunit (SSU) gene of the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) complex to identify protistan taxa. ResultsWe detected 8,561 OTUs from protistan taxa, including 35 taxonomic groups. We found high protistan diversity in the BW entering all three port systems, with the dominant taxa belonging to the Alveolata, Rhizaria and Stramenopiles. Thirty-eight taxa were found in high relative abundance (>10,000 sequences), and some were recovered from multiple samples within and across ports, indicating both a high relative abundance and frequency of introduction events. The composition of the protistan communities entering each of the port systems appeared to vary depending on BW source, with those entering Valdez being consistently more similar to each other than those entering other port systems. Main conclusionsThis study is the most comprehensive assessment of protistan diversity in BW and has important implications for microbial biogeography and invasions. Ships BW is importing distinct and diverse protistan communities to U.S. coasts with high propagule pressure for some taxa, creating opportunity for invasion by novel taxa. Further, our results demonstrate the broad-scale movement of marine protists that has occurred through BW, highlighting a discrepancy between the large magnitude of introductions and limited number of known microbial invasions.",2017,23,10.1111/ddi.12550

To address this issue, we investigated the abundance levels and diversities of aioA, arrA, arsC and arsM genes in estuarine sediments at low As levels across Southeastern China to uncover biogeographic patterns at a large spatial scale. Unexpectedly, genes involved in As biotransformation were characterized by high abundance and diversity. The functional microbial communities showed a significant decrease in similarity along the geographic distance, with higher turnover rates than taxonomic microbial communities based on the similarities of 16S rRNA genes. Further investigation with niche-based models showed that deterministic processes played primary roles in shaping both functional and taxonomic microbial communities.

Here, we examined soil bacterial beta-diversity across different habitats in the drylands of northern China. We evaluated the relative importance of environmental factors versus geographic distance to a distance-decay relationship, which would be explained by the relative effect of basic ecological processes recognized as drivers of diversity patterns in macrobial theoretical models such as selection and dispersal. Although the similarity of bacterial communities significantly declined with increasing geographic distance, the distance-decay slope and the relative importance of factors driving distance-decay patterns varied across different habitats. A strong distance-decay relationship was observed in the alpine grassland, where the community similarity was influenced only by the environmental factors. In contrast, geographic distance was solely responsible for community similarity in the desert. Even the average compositional similarity among locations in the desert was distinctly lower compared with those in other habitats. We found no evidence that dispersal limitation strongly influenced the beta-diversity of bacterial communities in the desert grassland and typical grassland. Together, our results provide robust evidence of habitat specificity for microbial diversity patterns and their underlying drivers. Our findings suggest that microorganisms also have multiple drivers of diversity patterns and some of which may be parallel to some fundamental processes for explaining biodiversity patterns in macroorganisms.",2017,11,10.1038/ismej.2017.11

Also, the PA community structures of bacteria differed from the FL ones and exhibited higher diversity than the FL ones, while the archaeal community structures did not show significant differences between PA and FL assemblages. We found that specific phylotypes of Gammaproteobacteria and Flavobacteria were abundant in PA bacterial assemblages, suggesting that they prefer to attach and consume particulate organic matter. In summary, the surface seawater PA assemblages represent very different bacterial and archaeal community structures between three different oceanic regions, each of which had distinct PA and FL community structures.

In this study, we examined whether communities would converge because similar taxa would be selected under the same environmental conditions, or would diverge because of initial community composition, after artificial dispersal. To this aim, a microcosm experiment was performed, in which the temporal changes in the composition and diversity of different prokaryoplankton assemblages from three distant geographic coastal areas (Banyuls-sur-Mer in northwest Mediterranean Sea, Pagasitikos Gulf in northeast Mediterranean and Woods Hole, MA, USA in the northwest Atlantic), were studied. Diversity was investigated using amplicon pyrosequencing of the V1-V3 hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA. The three assemblages were grown separately in particle free and autoclaved Banyuls-sur-mer seawater at 18 degrees C in the dark. We found that the variability of prokaryoplankton community diversity (expressed as richness, evenness and dominance) as well as the composition were driven by patterns observed in Bacteria. Regarding community composition, similarities were found between treatments at family level. However, at the OTU level microbial communities from the three different original locations diverge rather than converge during incubation. It is suggested that slight differences in the composition of the initial prokaryoplankton communities, resulted in separate clusters the following days even when growth took place under identical abiotic conditions.",2017,5,10.3390/microorganisms5020031

For microbes, assessing endemism in the Antarctic region has been particularly important, especially against a backdrop of debate regarding their presumed cosmopolitan nature. To contribute to this conversation, we highlight the observed endemism of the freshwater diatom genus Luticola in Antarctica by synthesizing the results of a modern high-resolution taxonomy from the Continental, Maritime, and sub-Antarctic regions. We report that Luticola has one of the highest endemic rates of any diatom genus in Antarctica, in terms of total number of species (taxon endemism) and percentage of the entire genus (phylogenetic endemism). Of the over 200 species of Luticola globally, nearly 20% (43) occur in the Antarctic, with 42 of these being endemic. Within regions, Maritime Antarctica has the largest number of Luticola species and endemics (28 and 23, respectively), followed by Continental Antarctica (14, 9) and sub-Antarctic islands (8, 6). Thus, 38 of the 42 endemics are found in a single region only. While the timing of Luticola diversification has not been established, fossil evidence suggests recent invasions and/or diversification over a relatively short geologic timescale.

The present study aimed to fill a knowledge gap by providing an explicit picture of spatial and temporal dynamics of a subset of these soil microorganisms at the plot scale. We selected an unfertilized perennial grassland, where nitrogen cycling is considered to be efficient and tightly coupled to plant growth. At six times over one growing season 60 soil samples were taken from a 10 m x 10 m area and abundances of marker genes for total archaea and bacteria (16S rRNA), nitrogen fixing bacteria (nifH), ammonia oxidizing archaea (amoA AOA) and bacteria (amoA AOB), and denitrifying bacteria (nirS, nirK and nosZ) were determined by qPCR. Potential nitrification activity (PNA) and denitrifying enzyme activity (DEA) were determined. Seasonal changes in abundance patterns of marker genes were detected, and were associated with changes in substrate availability associated with plant growth stages. Potential nitrification and denitrification enzyme activities were strongly spatially structured at the studied scale, corresponding to periods of rapid plant growth, June and October, and their spatial distributions were similar, providing visual evidence of highly localized spatial and temporal conditions at this scale. Temporal variability in the N -cycling communities versus the stability of their respective potential activities provided evidence of both short-lived temporal niche partitioning and a degree of microbial functional redundancy.

"Dai, WF; Zhang, JJ; Tu, QC; Deng, Y; Qiu, QF; Xiong, JB",Bacterioplankton assembly and interspecies interaction indicating increasing coastal eutrophication,CHEMOSPHERE,"Anthropogenic perturbations impose negative effects on coastal ecosystems, such as increasing levels of eutrophication. Given the biogeochemical significance of microorganisms, understanding the processes and mechanisms underlying their spatial distribution under changing environmental conditions is critical. To address this question, we examined how coastal bacterioplanlcton communities respond to increasing eutrophication levels created by anthropogenic perturbations. The results showed that the magnitude of changes in the bacterioplankton community compositions (BCCs) and the importance of deterministic processes that constrained bacterial assembly were closely associated with eutrophication levels. Moreover, increasing eutrophication significantly (P < 0.001) attenuated the distance decay rate, with a random spatial distribution of BCCs in the undisturbed location. In contrast, the complexity of interspecies interaction was enhanced under moderate eutrophication levels but declined under heavy eutrophication. Changes in the relative abundances of 27 bacterial families were significantly correlated with eutrophication levels. Notably, the pattern of enrichment or decrease for a given bacterial family was consistent with its known ecological functions. Our findings demonstrate that the magnitude of changes in BCCs and underlying determinism are dependent on eutrophication levels. However, the buffer capacity of bacterioplankton community is limited, with disrupted interspecies interaction occurring under heavy eutrophication. As such, bacterial assemblages are sensitive to changes in environmental conditions and could thus potentially serve as bio-indicators for increasing eutrophication. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

"Bai, R; Wang, JT; Deng, Y; He, JZ; Feng, K; Zhang, LM",Microbial Community and Functional Structure Significantly Varied among Distinct Types of Paddy Soils But Responded Differently along Gradients of Soil Depth Layers,FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY,"Paddy rice fields occupy broad agricultural area in China and cover diverse soil types. Microbial community in paddy soils is of great interest since many microorganisms are involved in soil functional processes. In the present study, Illumina Mi-Seq sequencing and functional gene array (GeoChip 4.2) techniques were combined to investigate soil microbial communities and functional gene patterns across the three soil types including an Inceptisol (Binhai), an Oxisol (Leizhou), and an Ultisol (Taoyuan) along four profile depths (up to 70 cm in depth) in mesocosm incubation columns. Detrended correspondence analysis revealed that distinctly differentiation in microbial community existed among soil types and profile depths, while the manifest variance in functional structure was only observed among soil types and two rice growth stages, but not across profile depths. Along the profile depth within each soil type, Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Firmicutes increased whereas Cyanobacteria, beta-proteobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia declined, suggesting their specific ecophysiological properties. Compared to bacterial community, the archaeal community showed a more contrasting pattern with the predominant groups within phyla Euryarchaeota, Thaumarchaeota, and Crenarchaeota largely varying among soil types and depths. Phylogenetic molecular ecological network (pMEN) analysis further indicated that the pattern of bacterial and archaeal communities interactions changed with soil depth and the highest modularity of microbial community occurred in top soils, implying a relatively higher system resistance to environmental change compared to communities in deeper soil layers. Meanwhile, microbial communities had higher connectivity in deeper soils in comparison with upper soils, suggesting less microbial interaction in surface soils. Structure equation models were developed and the models indicated that pH was the most representative characteristics of soil type and identified as the key driver in shaping both bacterial and archaeal community structure, but did not directly affect microbial functional structure. The distinctive pattern of microbial taxonomic and functional composition along soil profiles implied functional redundancy within these paddy soils.",2017,8,10.3389/fmicb.2017.00945

River communities varied among tributaries, but mainstem communities were spatially homogeneous and tracked seasonal changes in river discharge and co-varying factors. Co-occurrence network analysis identified strongly interconnected river assemblages during high (May) and low (December) discharge periods, and weakly interconnected transitional assemblages in September, suggesting that this system supports two seasonal microbial communities linked to river discharge. In contrast, plume communities showed little seasonal differences and instead varied spatially tracking salinity. However, salinity explained only a small fraction of community variability, and plume communities in blooms of diatom-diazotroph assemblages were strikingly different than those in other high salinity plume samples. This suggests that while salinity physically structures plumes through buoyancy and mixing, the composition of plume-specific communities is controlled by other factors including nutrients, phytoplankton community composition, and dissolved organic matter chemistry. Co-occurrence networks identified interconnected assemblages associated with the highly productive low salinity near-shore region, diatom-diazotroph blooms, and the plume edge region, and weakly interconnected assemblages in high salinity regions. This suggests that the plume supports a transitional community influenced by immigration of ocean bacteria from the plume edge, and by species sorting as these communities adapt to local environmental conditions. Few studies have explored patterns of microbial diversity in tropical rivers and coastal oceans. Comparison of Amazon continuum microbial communities to those from temperate and arctic systems suggest that river discharge and salinity are master variables structuring a range of environmental conditions that control bacterial communities across the river-ocean continuum.",2017,8,10.3389/fmicb.2017.00882

A total of 64 hypolithic communities were recovered from deserts on every continent plus a tropical moisture sufficient location. Community diversity was estimated using a combined t-RFLP fingerprinting and high throughput sequencing approach. The t-RFLP analysis revealed desert communities were different from the single non-desert location. A striking pattern also emerged where Antarctic desert communities were clearly distinct from all other deserts. Some overlap in community similarity occurred for hot, cold and tundra deserts. A further observation was that the producer-consumer ratio displayed a significant negative correlation with growing season, such that shorter growing seasons supported communities with greater abundance of producers, and this pattern was independent of macroclimate. High-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA and nifH genes from four representative samples validated the t-RFLP study and revealed patterns of taxonomic and putative diazotrophic diversity for desert communities from the Taklimakan Desert, Tibetan Plateau, Canadian Arctic and Antarctic. All communities were dominated by cyanobacteria and among these 21 taxa were potentially endemic to any given desert location. Some others occurred in all but the most extreme hot and polar deserts suggesting they were relatively less well adapted to environmental stress. The t-RFLP and sequencing data revealed the two most abundant cyanobacterial taxa were Phormidium in Antarctic and Tibetan deserts and Chroococcidiopsis in hot and cold deserts. The Arctic tundra displayed a more heterogenous cyanobacterial assemblage and this was attributed to the maritime-influenced sampling location. The most abundant heterotrophic taxa were ubiquitous among samples and belonged to the Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria. Sequencing using nitrogenase gene-specific primers revealed all putative diazotrophs were Proteobacteria of the orders Burkholderiales, Rhizobiales, and Rhodospirillales. We envisage cyanobacterial carbon input to the system is accompanied by nitrogen fixation largely from non-cyanobacterial taxa. Overall the results indicate desert hypoliths worldwide are dominated by cyanobacteria and that growing season is a useful predictor of their abundance. Differences in cyanobacterial taxa encountered may reflect their adaptation to different moisture availability regimes in polar and non-polar deserts.",2017,8,10.3389/fmicb.2017.00867
"Kellogg, CA; Goldsmith, DB; Gray, MA",Biogeographic Comparison of Lophelia-Associated Bacterial Communities in the Western Atlantic Reveals Conserved Core Microbiome,FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY,"Over the last decade, publications on deep-sea corals have tripled. Most attention has been paid to Lophelia pertusa, a globally distributed scleractinian coral that creates critical three-dimensional habitat in the deep ocean. The bacterial community associated with L. pertusa has been previously described by a number of studies at sites in the Mediterranean Sea, Norwegian fjords, off Great Britain, and in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM). However, use of different methodologies prevents direct comparisons in most cases. Our objectives were to address intra-regional variation and to identify any conserved bacterial core community. We collected samples from three distinct colonies of L. pertusa at each of four locations within the western Atlantic: three sites within the GOM and one off the east coast of the United States. Amplicon libraries of 16S rRNA genes were generated using primers targeting the V4-V5 hypervariable region and 454 pyrosequencing. The dominant phylum was Proteobacteria (75-96%). At the family level, 80-95% of each sample was comprised of five groups: Pirellulaceae, Pseudonocardiaceae, Rhodobacteraceae, Sphingomonadaceae, and unclassified Oceanospirillales. Principal coordinate analysis based on weighted UniFrac distances showed a clear distinction between the GOM and Atlantic samples. Interestingly, the replicate samples from each location did not always cluster together, indicating there is not a strong site-specific influence. The core bacterial community, conserved in 100% of the samples, was dominated by the operational taxonomic units of genera Novosphingobium and Pseudonocardia, both known degraders of aromatic hydrocarbons. The sequence of another core member, Propionibacterium, was also found in prior studies of L. pertusa from Norway and Great Britain, suggesting a role as a conserved symbiont. By examining more than 40,000 sequences per sample, we found that GOM samples were dominated by the identified conserved core sequences, whereas open Atlantic samples had a much higher proportion of locally consistent bacteria. Further, predictive functional profiling highlights the potential for the L. pertusa microbiome to contribute to chemoautotrophy, nutrient cycling, and antibiotic production.",2017,8,10.3389/fmicb.2017.00796

Actinobacterial diversity has been thoroughly researched in various environments due to its unique biotechnological potential. Such studies have focused mostly on soil communities, but more recently marine and extreme environments have also been explored, finding rare taxa and demonstrating dispersal limitation and biogeographic patterns for Streptomyces. To test the distribution of Actinobacteria populations on a small scale, we chose the extremely oligotrophic and biodiverse Cuatro Cienegas Basin (CCB), an endangered oasis in the Chihuahuan desert to assess the diversity and uniqueness of Actinobacteria in the Churince System with a culture-dependent approach over a period of three years, using nine selective media. The 16S rDNA of putative Actinobacteria were sequenced using both bacteria universal and phylum-specific primer pairs. Phylogenetic reconstructions were performed to analyze OTUs clustering and taxonomic identification of the isolates in an evolutionary context, using validated type species of Streptomyces from previously phylogenies as a reference. Rarefaction analysis for total Actinobacteria and for Streptomyces isolates were performed to estimate species richness in the intermediate lagoon (IL) in the oligotrophic Churince system. A total of 350 morphologically and nutritionally diverse isolates were successfully cultured and characterized as members of the Phylum Actinobacteria. A total of 105 from the total isolates were successfully subcultured, processed for DNA extraction and 16S-rDNA sequenced. All strains belong to the order Actinomycetales, encompassing 11 genera of Actinobacteria; the genus Streptomyces was found to be the most abundant taxa in all the media tested throughout the 3-year sampling period. Phylogenetic analysis of our isolates and another 667 reference strains of the family Streptomycetaceae shows that our isolation effort produced 38 unique OTUs in six new monophyletic clades. This high biodiversity and uniqueness of Actinobacteria in an extreme oligotrophic environment, which has previously been reported for its diversity and endemicity, is a suggestive sign of microbial biogeography of Actinobacteria and it also represents an invaluable source of biological material for future ecological and bioprospecting studies.",2017,5,10.7717/peerj.3247

In culture, however, most viral isolates that infect microbes are represented by a few variants isolated on type strains, limiting our ability to study how natural variation affects virus-host interactions in the laboratory. We screened a set of 137 hot spring samples for viruses that infect a geographically diverse panel of the hyperthemophilic crenarchaeon Sulfolobus islandicus. We isolated and characterized eight SIRVs (Sulfolobus islandicus rod-shaped viruses) from two different regions within Yellowstone National Park (USA). Comparative genomics revealed that all SIRV sequenced isolates share 30 core genes that represent 50-60% of the genome. The core genome phylogeny, as well as the distribution of variable genes (shared by some but not all SIRVs) and the signatures of host-virus interactions recorded on the CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) repeat-spacer arrays of S. islandicus hosts, identify different SIRV lineages, each associated with a different geographic location. Moreover, our studies reveal that SIRV core genes do not appear to be under diversifying selection and thus we predict that the abundant and diverse variable genes govern the coevolutionary arms race between SIRVs and their hosts.",2017,9,10.3390/v9050120

They may be cryptoendolithic within pore spaces of weathered rocks, or develop in cracks and fissures as chasmoendolithic communities and are characterised by coloured bands of colonisation. Here we used a precision drill to recover fractions from black, white, green and red layers within colonised granite and sandstone. We combined backscattered scanning electron microscopy and high-throughput sequencing to identify major taxa in each band. We confirmed the presence of algal and fungal lichen symbionts, cyanobacteria and free-living algae, plus a diverse heterotrophic bacterial and archaeal component. A clear delineation at the community level was observed. The relatively biodiverse and heterogenous lichen communities occurred in weathered sandstone cliffs, whilst in granite and sandstone boulders, cyanobacterial communities were dominant. Differences between coloured bands of colonisation within each community were less clear.

The rice bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola (Xoc) has been demonstrated to contain a biosynthetic operon with cyclases capable of producing the universal GA precursor ent-kaurene. Genetic (knock-out) studies indicate that the derived diterpenoid serves as a virulence factor for this rice leaf streak pathogen, serving to reduce the jasmonic acid-mediated defense response. Here the functions of the remaining genes in the Xoc operon are elucidated and the distribution of the operon in X. oryzae is investigated in over 100 isolates. The Xoc operon leads to production of the bioactive GA(4), an additional step beyond production of the penultimate precursor GA(9) mediated by the homologous operons recently characterized from rhizobia. Moreover, this GA biosynthetic operon was found to be widespread in Xoc (> 90%), but absent in the other major X. oryzae pathovar. These results indicate selective pressure for production of GA(4) in the distinct lifestyle of Xoc, and the importance of GA to both fungal and bacterial pathogens of rice.",2017,214,10.1111/nph.14441
