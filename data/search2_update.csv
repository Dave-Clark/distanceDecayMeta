"Lennon, JT; Locey, KJ",More support for Earths massive microbiome,BIOLOGY DIRECT,"Until recently, our planet was thought to be home to similar to 10(7) species, largely belonging to plants and animals. Despite being the most abundant organisms on Earth, the contribution of microbial life to global biodiversity has been greatly underestimated and, in some cases, completely overlooked. Using a compilation of data known as the Global Prokaryotic Census (GPC), it was recently claimed that there are similar to 10(6) extant bacterial and archaeal taxa [1], an estimate that is orders of magnitude lower than predictions for global microbial biodiversity based on the lognormal model of biodiversity and diversity-abundance scaling laws [2]. Here, we resolve this discrepancy by 1) identifying violations of sampling theory, 2) correcting for the misuse of biodiversity theory, and 3) conducting a reanalysis of the GPC. By doing so, we uncovered greater support for diversity-abundance scaling laws and the lognormal model of biodiversity, which together predict that Earth is home to 10(12) or more microbial taxa.",2020,15,10.1186/s13062-020-00261-8

New methodological approaches and concepts are being developed to study such large-scale patterns in microbial communities, resulting in new perspectives that represent a significant advances for both microbiology and macroecology. Here, we identify and review important conceptual, computational, and methodological challenges and opportunities in microbial macroecology.

By contrast, diversity in soil microorganisms is generally considered as mostly driven by edaphic variables and, therefore, difficult to extrapolate on a large spatial scale based on predictive models. Here, we compared the power of topo-climatic versus edaphic variables for predicting the diversity of various soil protist groups at the regional scale. Location Swiss western Alps. Taxa Full protist community and nine clades belonging respectively to three functional groups: parasites (Apicomplexa, Peronosporomycetes and Phytomyxea), phagotrophs (Sarcomonadea, Tubulinea and Spirotrichea) and phototrophs (Chlorophyta, Trebouxiophyceae and Diatomeae). Methods We extracted soil DNA from 178 sites along a wide range of elevations with a random-stratified sampling design. We defined protist Operational Taxonomic Units assemblages by metabarcoding of the V4 region of the rRNA small subunit gene. We assessed and modelled the diversity (Shannon index) patterns of all above-mentioned taxonomic groups based on topo-climatic (topography, slope southness, slope steepness and average summer temperature) and edaphic (soil temperature, relative humidity, pH, electroconductivity, phosphorus percentage, carbon/nitrogen, loss on ignition and shale percentage) variables in Generalized Additive Models (GAM). Results The respective significance of topo-climatic and edaphic variables varied among taxonomic and-to a certain extent-functional groups: while many variables explained significantly the diversity of the three phototrophs this was less the case for the three parasites. Topo-climatic variables had a better predictive power than edaphic variables, yet predictive power varied among taxonomic groups. Main conclusions Topo-climatic variables (particularly slope steepness and summer temperature if we consider their significance in the GAMs) were, on average, better predictors of protist diversity at the landscape scale than edaphic variables. However, the predictive power of these variables on diversity differed considerably among taxonomic groups; such relationships may be due to direct and/or indirect (e.g. biotic) influences (like with parasitic taxa, where low predictive power is most likely explained by the absence of information on the hosts distribution). Future prospects include using such spatial models to predict hotspots of diversity and disease outbreaks.",,,10.1111/jbi.13755

How the specialization of guilds of organisms varies along environmental gradients underpins popular theories of biogeography and macroecology, whereas the degree of specialization of a species is typically considered fixed. However, the extent to which environmental context impacts specialization dynamics is seldom examined empirically. In this study, we examine how specialization within a bipartite network consisting of three co-occurring plant species and their foliar fungal endophyte symbionts changes along a 1000-meter elevation gradient where host species were held constant. The gradient, along the slope of Mauna Loa shield volcano, represents almost the entire elevational range of two of the three plants. Network and plant specialization values displayed a parabolic relationship with elevation, and were highest at middle elevations, whereas bipartite associations were least specific at low and high elevations. Shannons diversity of fungal endophytes correlated negatively with specificity, and was highest at the ends of the transects. Although plant host was a strong determinant of fungal community composition within sites, fungal species turnover was high among sites. There was no evidence of spatial or elevational patterning in fungal community compositon. Our work demonstrates that specificity can be a plastic trait, which is influenced by the environment and centrality of the host within its natural range.",2019,13,10.1038/s41396-019-0470-4

A major gap in our understanding remains the comparison of diversity patterns across a broad spectrum of evolutionarily and functionally diverse organisms, particularly in the marine realm. Here, we aim to narrow this gap by comparing the diversity patterns of free-living microbes and macro-invertebrates across a natural experiment provided by the marine lakes of Palau: geographically discrete and environmentally heterogeneous bodies of seawater with comparable geological and climatic history, and a similar regional species pool. We find contrasting patterns of alpha-diversity but remarkably similar patterns of beta-diversity between microbial and macro-invertebrate communities among lakes. Pairwise dissimilarities in community composition among lakes are positively correlated between microbes and macro-invertebrates, and influenced to a similar degree by marked gradients in oxygen concentration and salinity. Our findings indicate that a shared spatio-temporal and environmental context may result in parallel patterns of beta-diversity in microbes and macro-invertebrates, in spite of key trait differences between these organisms. This raises the possibility that parallel processes also influence transitions among regional biota across the tree of life, at least in the marine realm.",2019,286,10.1098/rspb.2019.0999

Yet, despite increasing efforts to characterize soil bacterial and fungal assemblages, it is challenging to disentangle the influences of sampling design on assessments of communities. Here, we sought to determine whether composite samples-often analyzed as a low cost and effort alternative to replicated individual samples-provide representative summary estimates of microbial communities. At three Minnesota agricultural research sites planted with an oat cover crop, we conducted amplicon sequencing for soil bacterial and fungal communities (16S(V4) and ITS2) of replicated individual or homogenized composite soil samples. We compared soil microbiota from within and among plots and then among agricultural sites using both sampling strategies. Results indicated that single or multiple replicated individual samples, or a composite sample from each plot, were sufficient for distinguishing broad site-level macroecological differences among bacterial and fungal communities. Analysis of a single sample per plot captured only a small fraction of the distinct OTUs, diversity, and compositional variability detected in the analysis of multiple individual samples or a single composite sample. Likewise, composite samples captured only a fraction of the diversity represented by the six individual samples from which they were formed, and, on average, analysis of two or three individual samples offered greater compositional coverage (i.e., greater number of OTUs) than a single composite sample. We conclude that sampling design significantly impacts estimates of bacterial and fungal communities even in homogeneously managed agricultural soils, and our findings indicate that while either strategy may be sufficient for broad macroecological investigations, composites may be a poor substitute for replicated samples at finer spatial scales.",2019,78,10.1007/s00248-019-01318-6

"Soininen, J; Teittinen, A",Fifteen important questions in the spatial ecology of diatoms,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"Recently, studies about the spatial distribution of microbial species and communities have increased substantially. Freshwater diatoms are used as one of the most popular model taxa in such macroecological studies, but the most exciting patterns in the spatial ecology of diatoms have not been reviewed. Here, we identify 15 important questions about freshwater diatom ecology, review the major findings, and suggest novel research avenues. We found that diatoms do not support classical latitudinal diversity gradient, species-area relationship or Rapoports rule. We found some, albeit inconsistent support for an elevational diversity gradient, Bergmanns rule and niche conservation. Diatoms do support a positive interspecific abundance-occupancy relationship like nearly all other taxa. With regards to metacommunity dynamics, diatom communities are typically structured by species sorting, but neutral dynamics or mass effects are also evident at large or small spatial scale, respectively. Taken together, this review suggests that diatoms follow some classical biogeographical patterns similarly to larger taxa, but patterns are typically weaker than for macro-organisms. This may result because diatoms are typically relatively strongly controlled by local factors and often exhibit efficient stochastic dispersal processes both at small and large scales. More research is needed to build a more comprehensive view of diatom species-area relationships and latitudinal gradients in diversity, for example. In the future, well-replicated macroecological field experiments, diatom studies with intercontinental or global coverage, trait-based approaches, and DNA-based species identification would be fruitful avenues to shed more light into the spatial ecology of diatoms.",2019,64,10.1111/fwb.13384

Residence time is the ratio of an ecosystems size to its rate of flow and provides a means for understanding the influence of physical turnover on biological systems. Despite its use across scientific disciplines, residence time has not been integrated into the broader understanding of biodiversity, life history, and the assembly of ecological communities. Here we propose a residence time theory for the growth, activity, abundance, and diversity of traits and taxa in complex ecological systems. Using thousands of stochastic individual-based models to simulate energetically constrained life-history processes, we show that our predictions are conceptually sound and mutually compatible and that they support ecological relationships that underpin much of biodiversity theory.

"Geyer, KM; Barrett, JE",Unimodal productivity-diversity relationships among bacterial communities in a simple polar soil ecosystem,ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY,"Unlike other macroecological principles, relationships between productivity and diversity have not been effectively tested for microbial communities. Here we describe an experiment in which the availability of resources to soil bacterial communities was manipulated in a model system, the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica. Mannitol additions were used to simulate a productivity gradient such that a response in bacterial biomass production, taxonomic diversity and functioning (e.g., enzyme activity) were induced. Resource amendment induced a positive linear response in microbial productivity (P < 0.001) but a unimodal (hump-shaped) response in microbial diversity at multiple taxonomic scales (P = 0.035). Putative oligotrophic (e.g., phyla Nitrospirae and Cyanobacteria) and copiotrophic (e.g., phylum Proteobacteria) taxa were apparent through substantial community turnover along the resource gradient. Soil enzyme activity was inversely related to bacterial biomass but positively related to diversity, suggesting the latter may be a stronger control over enzyme-mediated decomposition. The mechanisms behind this pattern are consistent with macroecological theory of a shift from environmental (e.g., stress tolerance) to biotic (e.g., competition) drivers with increasing resource availability. This evidence is among the first of its kind to document a significant unimodal productivity-diversity relationship for soil bacteria.",2019,21,10.1111/1462-2920.14639

Airborne microbial transport is assumed to occupy a central role in determining dispersal outcomes(2,3), and extra-range dispersal has important implications for predicting ecosystem resilience and response to environmental changes. One of the most pertinent biomes in this regard is Antarctica, given its geographic isolation and vulnerability to climate change and human disturbances. Here, we report microbial diversity in near-ground and high-altitude air above the largest ice-free Antarctic habitat, as well as that of underlying soil microbial communities. We found that persistent local airborne inputs were unable to fully explain Antarctic soil community assembly. Comparison with airborne microbial diversity from high-altitude and non-polar sources suggests that strong selection occurs during long-range atmospheric transport. The influence of selection during airborne transit and at sink locations varied between microbial phyla. Overall, the communities from this isolated Antarctic ecosystem displayed limited connectivity to the non-polar microbial pool, and alternative sources of recruitment are necessary to fully explain extant soil diversity.

Nevertheless, the diversity of topics explored, and those not well explored, has not been systematically assessed. We conducted a systematic review of the published scientific literature in disease ecology of mammals and subjected the collection of original and review articles identified to a topic modeling approach, which is based on the words used in the published texts and their contexts (i.e., the frequency and strength of their semantic relationships with one another). In addition to concept maps identifying the most prominent research themes, we identified eight (not mutually exclusive) subcategories of studies, including experimental, theoretical, comparative, behavioral, immunological-microbiological, biogeographic-macroecological, vector-focused (e.g., mosquitoes), and disturbance-focused. The most prominent themes arising in review papers included the ecology of zoonotic diseases transmitted from non-human mammals, comparisons of pathogen prevalence between mammalian species, and pathogen discovery-disease surveillance studies, particularly of marine mammals and bats. For the original articles, the most prominent themes included ecology of rodent-transmitted viral and bacterial diseases and the population biology of zoonotic hosts. Most studies used comparative or descriptive approaches to investigate mammal-pathogen-disease relationships at a local scale, focusing on vector-borne diseases. Experimental, modeling, immunological, and behavioral approaches were strikingly underrepresented. Topics of strong conceptual importance, but that are underrepresented in the current literature, include: 1) the effects of the population density of mammalian hosts, and manipulations of density, on pathogen transmission; 2) macroecological studies that quantify effects of mammalian host species on parasite abundance and prevalence; and 3) effects of climate change on physiological and behavioral processes relevant to mammal-parasite interactions.",2019,100,10.1093/jmammal/gyy174

However, distributions of parasitic species have not been comprehensively compared in this context. We investigated which factors most influence the geographical extent of mammal parasites. Using the Global Mammal Parasite Database we analysed 17 818 individual geospatial records on 1806 parasite species (encompassing viruses, bacteria, protozoa, arthropods and helminths) that infect 396 carnivore, ungulate and primate host species. As a measure of the geographical extent of each parasite species we quantified the number and area of world ecoregions occupied by each. To evaluate the importance of variables influencing the summed area of ecoregions occupied by a parasite species, we used Bayesian network analysis of a subset (n = 866) of the parasites in our database that had at least two host species and complete information on parasite traits. We found that parasites that covered more geographical area had a greater number of host species, higher average phylogenetic relatedness between host species and more sampling effort. Host and parasite taxonomic groups had weak and indirect effects on parasite ecoregion area; parasite transmission mode had virtually no effect. Mechanistically, a greater number of host species probably increases both the collective abundance and habitat breadth of hosts, providing more opportunities for a parasite to have an expansive range. Furthermore, even though mammals are one of the best-studied animal classes, the ecoregion area occupied by their parasites is strongly sensitive to sampling effort, implying mammal parasites are undersampled. Overall, our results support that parasite geographical extent is largely controlled by host characteristics, many of which are subsumed within host taxonomic identity.",2019,286,10.1098/rspb.2019.0673

Here, we untangle the complexity of the human microbiome for the Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) that is the most prevalent functional gastrointestinal disorder in human populations. Based on a novel information theoretic network inference model, we detected potential species interaction networks that are functionally and structurally different for healthy and unhealthy individuals. Healthy networks are characterized by a neutral symmetrical pattern of species interactions and scale-free topology versus random unhealthy networks. We detected an inverse scaling relationship between species total outgoing information flow, meaningful of node interactivity, and relative species abundance (RSA). The top ten interacting species are also the least relatively abundant for the healthy microbiome and the most detrimental. These findings support the idea about the diminishing role of network hubs and how these should be defined considering the total outgoing information flow rather than the node degree. Macroecologically, the healthy microbiome is characterized by the highest Pareto total species diversity growth rate, the lowest species turnover, and the smallest variability of RSA for all species. This result challenges current views that posit a universal association between healthy states and the highest absolute species diversity in ecosystems. Additionally, we show how the transitory microbiome is unstable and microbiome criticality is not necessarily at the phase transition between healthy and unhealthy states. We stress the importance of considering portfolios of interacting pairs versus single node dynamics when characterizing the microbiome and of ranking these pairs in terms of their interactions (i.e., species collective behavior) that shape transition from healthy to unhealthy states. The macroecological characterization of the microbiome is useful for public health and disease diagnosis and etiognosis, while species-specific analyses can detect beneficial species leading to personalized design of pre- and probiotic treatments and microbiome engineering.",2019,21,10.3390/e21050506

Large-scale studies are lacking for soil animals, which control microbial communities and represent one of the most diverse yet poorly known animal assemblages. Here, we analyzed a major group (Oribatida) to test whether belowground macroecological patterns can be predicted by climatic variables, vegetation and large-scale variation in key soil properties. Location We modelled the multivariate distribution of more than 100 species using biodiversity data collected across Great Britain in the framework of the Countryside Survey (). Methods We analyzed species-level data from 582 samples collected across 162 hectads (10 x 10 km) covering the largest possible range of vegetation types, soil properties and climatic conditions within GB. We created the first large-scale maps of soil animal diversity metrics at the GB scale, including novel estimates of metrics of phylogenetic diversity (PD). Using structural equation modelling, we quantified the direct and indirect effects of location (latitude, longitude), plant community structure and abiotic factors such as precipitation on species composition, richness and PD. Results We found that variation in species composition follows a latitudinal gradient with diversity generally increasing northward. The latitudinal variation in species composition drives PD via changes in both species richness and phylogenetic distance between species. This gradient is mostly determined by latitudinal variation in precipitation and organic matter, which were very good predictors of species composition. Precipitation and organic matter were, however, relatively weak while statistically significant predictors of diversity metrics. Conclusions Past studies have emphasized the unpredictability of species distributions and variation in species composition in hyper diverse soil animal communities. However, past studies were conducted at small scales, where stochastic factors may weaken the signal of deterministic factors. Oribatid mites in our study show for the first time that the large scale latitudinal gradients in climate and organic matter predict not only variation in species composition but also taxonomic and PD of soil animal communities.",2019,46,10.1111/jbi.13501

It is affected both by geographic and environmental distance between sites. Therefore, analyzing phylogenetic turnover in environmental space requires removing the effect of geographic distance. Here, we apply a novel approach by deciphering phylogenetic turnover of European tetrapods in environmental space after removing geographic land distance effects. We demonstrate that phylogenetic turnover is strongly structured in environmental space, particularly in ectothermic tetrapods, and is well explained by macroecological characteristics such as niche size, species richness and relative phylogenetic diversity. In ectotherms, rather recent evolutionary processes were important in structuring phylogenetic turnover along environmental gradients. In contrast, early evolutionary processes had already shaped the current structure of phylogenetic turnover in endotherms. Our approach enables the disentangling of the idiosyncrasies of evolutionary processes such as the degree of niche conservatism and diversification rates in structuring biodiversity.",2019,10,10.1038/s41467-018-08232-4
"Early, R; Keith, SA",Geographically variable biotic interactions and implications for species ranges,GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY,"The challenge Understanding how biotic interactions affect species geographical ranges, biodiversity patterns and ecological responses to environmental change is one of the most pressing challenges in macroecology. Extensive efforts are underway to detect signals of biotic interactions in macroecological data. However, efforts are limited by bias in the taxa and spatial scale for which occurrence data are available and by difficulty in ascribing causality to co-occurrence patterns. Moreover, we are not necessarily looking in the right places; analyses are largely ad hoc, depending on availability of data, rather than focusing on regions, taxa, ecosystems or interaction types where biotic interactions might affect species geographical ranges most strongly. Unpicking biotic interactions We suggest that macroecology would benefit from the recognition that abiotic conditions alter two key components of biotic interaction strength: frequency and intensity. We outline how and why variation in biotic interaction strength occurs, explore the implications for species geographical ranges and discuss the challenges inherent in quantifying these effects. In addition, we explore the role of behavioural flexibility in mediating biotic interactions potentially to mitigate impacts of environmental change. New data We argue that macroecology should take advantage of independent data on the strength of biotic interactions measured by other disciplines, in order to capture a far wider array of taxa, locations and interaction types than are typically studied in macroecology. Data on biotic interactions are readily available from community, disease, microbial and parasite ecology, evolution, palaeontology, invasion biology and agriculture, but most are yet to be exploited within macroecology. Integrating biotic interaction strength data into macroecology Harmonization of data across interdisciplinary sources, taxa and interaction types could be achieved by breaking down interactions into elements that contribute to frequency and intensity.

Based primarily on laboratory experiments, PUAs have been implicated in deleterious effects on herbivores and competing phytoplankton species or in the regulation of the rates of bacterial organic matter remineralization; however, the role of the PUAs at an ecosystem level is still under discussion. Using data of PUA production in natural phytoplankton assemblages over a wide range of conditions, we analyzed macroecological patterns aiming for a comprehensive environmental contextualization that will further our understanding of the control and ecologic role played by these compounds. PUA composition changed from the predominance of decadienal in oligotrophy, octadienal in eutrophy, and heptadienal at intermediate conditions. The production of PUAs per unit biomass also showed a strong relationship with the trophic status, sharply increasing towards oligotrophic conditions and with small-sized cells reaching the highest production rates. High ratios of dissolved inorganic nitrogen to dissolved inorganic phosphorus also promoted PUA production, albeit to a considerably lesser extent. Although the allelopathic use of PUAs to outcompete other phytoplankton or reduce herbivory may be key in some environments and interactions, the macroecological patterns found here, showing higher production towards the poorest waters and among the small species typically populating these environments, support and link at the large scale the hypotheses of the nutrient-derived stress as driver for the production of PUAs together with the use of these compounds as boosters for the nutrient remineralization.",2018,8,10.1038/s41598-018-29787-8

In this review, we discuss the major discoveries across the past two decades. We quantitatively synthesise the frequency by which different concepts and topics appeared in the peer-reviewed literature, as well as the connections between these topics. We then look forward to identify pressing research frontiers and opportunities for additional integration in the future. We find that there has been a shift towards viewing plant-pollinator interactions as networks and towards understanding how global drivers influence the plants, pollinators and the ecosystem service of pollination. Future frontiers include moving towards a macroecological view of plant-pollinator interactions, understanding how ecological intensification and urbanisation will influence pollination, considering other interactions, such as plant-microbe-pollinator networks, and understanding the causes and consequences of extinctions. Pollination Ecology is poised to advance our basic understanding of the ecological and evolutionary factors that shape plant-animal interactions and to create applied knowledge that informs conservation decision making.",2018,21,10.1111/ele.13094
"Finotello, F; Mastrorilli, E; Di Camillo, B",Measuring the diversity of the human microbiota with targeted next-generation sequencing,BRIEFINGS IN BIOINFORMATICS,"The human microbiota is a complex ecological community of commensal, symbiotic and pathogenic microorganisms harboured by the human body. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, in particular targeted amplicon sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene (16S-seq), are enabling the identification and quantification of human-resident microorganisms at unprecedented resolution, providing novel insights into the role of the microbiota in health and disease. Once microbial abundances are quantified through NGS data analysis, diversity indices provide valuable mathematical tools to describe the ecological complexity of a single sample or to detect species differences between samples. However, diversity is not a determined physical quantity for which a consensus definition and unit of measure have been established, and several diversity indices are currently available. Furthermore, they were originally developed for macroecology and their robustness to the possible bias introduced by sequencing has not been characterized so far. To assist the reader with the selection and interpretation of diversity measures, we review a panel of broadly used indices, describing their mathematical formulations, purposes and properties, and characterize their behaviour and criticalities in dependence of the data features using simulated data as ground truth. In addition, we make available an R package, DiversitySeq, which implements in a unified framework the full panel of diversity indices and a simulator of 16S-seq data, and thus represents a valuable resource for the analysis of diversity from NGS count data and for the benchmarking of computational methods for 16S-seq.",2018,19,10.1093/bib/bbw119
"Wilcox, JJS; Hollocher, H",Unprecedented Symbiont Eukaryote Diversity Is Governed by Internal Trophic Webs in a Wild Non-Human Primate,PROTIST,"Research on host-associated microbiomes has highlighted major divisions between the role of eukaryotes in free-living and symbiont systems. These trends call into question the relevance of macroecological processes to host-associated systems and the relative importance of parasitism, commensalism, and mutualism as evolutionary patterns across the domains of life. However, it is unclear as to whether these apparent differences reflect biological realities or methodologies in community characterization: free-living eukaryotes tend to be characterized using metabarcoding whereas symbiont eukaryotes are typically characterized with microscopy. Here, we utilize an Illumina high-throughput metabarcoding approach to characterize the diversity and dynamics of eukaryotic symbiont communities in the feces of a wild non-human primate, Macaca fascicularis, revealing functionally and taxonomically diverse communities of eukaryotes hitherto unreported from any vertebrate. Importantly, community assembly was consistent with top-down and bottom-up trophic food web dynamics, high-lighting the applicability of macroecological principles to these communities. Ultimately, our findings highlight vertebrate-associated symbiont communities of the gut that are much more similar to free-living systems than previously realized. Additionally, our results support a role for symbiosis as a major recurrent life strategy among eukaryotes and highlight the potential for vertebrates to host vast reservoirs of unexplored eukaryotic diversity.

Patterns that maintain and generate biodiversity of macro-organisms in the Neotropics are widely discussed in the scientific literature, yet the spatial ecology of micro-organisms is largely unknown. The unique character of the tropical Andes and adjacent Amazon lowlands generates a wide gradient of environmental conditions to advance our understanding of what drives community assembly and diversity processes. 2. We analysed the distribution patterns of benthic diatoms (unicellular siliceous algae) as a model group of microbial passive dispersers, including predictors that describe limnological and geo-climatic gradients for a total of 113 waterbodies (0-28 degrees S and 58-80 degrees W), including lakes and streams. Complementary multivariate statistical analyses were performed to correlate (1) community composition and (2) diatom species richness with environmental and spatial factors to infer niche-based and dispersal-based assembly processes, respectively. 3. Results showed that two gradients structured both diatom assemblages and waterbodies, namely climate and landscape configuration. Variance partitioning revealed that broadscale spatial variables (distance-based Morans Eigenvectors) outperformed the two environmental components (limnological and geo-climatic), suggesting dispersal-assembled communities. However, diatom assemblages were structured by geo-climatic (regional) factors in certain lakes in the northern and central Andes, although their effects were partially manifested via local variables after the geographical distances were factored out. In a similar way, climatic and topographic structuring homogenized lake and stream communities within ecoregions, as indicated by the strong overlap between the two community types and the weak correlation between biota and limnological variables. Notably, a significant increase in diatom species richness was related to increased water connectivity, interpreted to indicate that a decrease in the remoteness of the system increase species number. 4. Synthesis. We emphasize the strength of macroecological gradients (landscape configuration and climatic factors) in affecting both diatom diversity and community composition in the South American tropics. In this context, our results and the commonalities of ecoregion patterning with groups of macro-organisms (vegetation) suggest the need to integrate microbial ecology into a macroecology framework to unravel mechanisms behind diversity gradients.",2018,106,10.1111/1365-2745.12934

Accumulating evidence suggests that aside from this direct role, other infectious agents may also indirectly affect cancer epidemiology through interactions with the oncogenic agents within the wider infection community. Here, we address this hypothesis via analysis of large-scale global data to identify associations between human cancer incidence and assemblages of neglected infectious agents. We focus on a gradient of three widely-distributed cancers with an infectious cause: bladder (similar to 2% of recorded cancer cases are due to Shistosoma haematobium), liver (similar to 60% consecutive to Hepatitis B and C infection) and stomach (Helicobacter pylori is associated with similar to 70% of cases). We analyzed countries in tropical and temperate regions separately, and controlled for many confounding social and economic variables. First, we found that particular assemblages of bacteria are associated with bladder cancer incidences. Second, we observed a specific and robust association between helminths and liver cancer incidences in both biomes. Third, we show that certain assemblages of viruses may facilitate stomach cancer in tropical area, while others protect against its development in temperate countries. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results in terms of cancer prevention and highlight the necessity to consider neglected diseases, especially in tropics, to adapt public health strategies against infectious diseases and cancer.",2018,61,10.1016/j.meegid.2018.03.016

Few facets of biology vary more than functional traits and life-history traits. To explore this vast variation, functional ecologists and population ecologists have developed independent approaches that identify the mechanisms behind and consequences of trait variation. 2. Collaborative research between researchers using trait-based and demographic approaches remains scarce. We argue that this is a missed opportunity, as the strengths of both approaches could help boost the research agendas of functional ecology and population ecology. 3. This special feature, which spans three journals of the British Ecological Society due to its interdisciplinary nature, showcases state-of-the-art research applying trait-based and demographic approaches to examine relationships between organismal function, life history strategies and population performance across multiple kingdoms. Examples include the exploration of how functional trait x environment interactions affect vital rates and thus explain population trends and species occurrence; the coordination of seed traits and dispersal ability with the pace of life in plants; the incorporation of functional traits in dynamic energy budget models; or the discovery of linkages between microbial functional traits and the fast-slow continuum. 4. Despite their historical isolation, collaborative work between functional ecologists and population ecologists could unlock novel research pathways. We call for an integrative research agenda to evaluate which and when traits are functional, as well as their ability to describe and predict life history strategies and population dynamics. We highlight promising, complementary research avenues to overcome current limitations. These include a more explicit linkage of selection gradients in the context of functional trait-vital rate relationships, and the implementation of standardised protocols to track changes in traits and vital rates over time at the same location and individuals, thus allowing for the explicit incorporation of trade-offs in analyses of covariation of functional traits and life-history traits.",2018,32,10.1111/1365-2435.13148
"Polishchuk, LV","MS Ghilarovs Principle, or biomass equivalence rule, as one of conservation laws in ecology",ZHURNAL OBSHCHEI BIOLOGII,"It may seem surprising that in ecology as in physics there are conservation laws, though these laws are less accurate than in physics and hold only on average, that is, on large spatial scales (macroecology). One of such laws is a biomass equivalence rule, which was proposed by Sheldon and later confirmed by Tseitlin and others. According to the rule, in equal intervals of the logarithm of body size, spanning the range from bacteria to whales, the biomass of marine pelagic organisms remains approximately equal. However, as noted by Tseitlin long before Sheldon et al.s work, a similar regularity was discovered by M.S. Ghilarov for soil organisms. In his 1944 paper, M.S. Ghilarov unequivocally wrote: The biomass of soil organisms of different natural body-size groups is approximately of the same order of magnitude: the product of the number of organisms belonging to a given size group times their linear size cubed varies very little. Here, I show that M.S. Ghilarovs natural body-size groups, in the range from bacteria to myriapods and insects, occupy approximately equal size intervals on a logarithmic scale. It turns out that for both soil and pelagial, equal logarithmic intervals of body size contain approximately equal biomasses. The priority of the discovery of this rule belongs to M.S. Ghilarov. After Tseitlin, I propose to call it the M.S. Ghilarov principle. Furthermore, I suggest that the M.S. Ghilarov principle holds not only for soil and pelagic organisms but also for other organisms inhabiting sufficiently homogeneous and extended habitats.",2018,79,10.7868/S0044459618030028

Here, we take a macroecological approach to investigate factors influencing why some parasites show a tendency to infect species widely distributed in the host phylogeny (phylogenetic generalism) while others infect only closely related hosts. Using a database on over 1400 parasite species that have been documented to infect up to 69 terrestrial mammal host species, we characterize the phylogenetic generalism of parasites using standard effect sizes for three metrics: mean pairwise phylogenetic distance (PD), maximum PD and phylogenetic aggregation. We identify a trend towards phylogenetic specialism, though statistically host relatedness is most often equivalent to that expected from a random sample of host species. Bacteria and arthropod parasites are typically the most generalist, viruses and helminths exhibit intermediate generalism, and protozoa are on average the most specialist. While viruses and helminths have similar mean pairwise PD on average, the viruses exhibit higher variation as a group. Close-contact transmission is the transmission mode most associated with specialism. Most parasites exhibiting phylogenetic aggregation (associating with discrete groups of species dispersed across the host phylogeny) are helminths and viruses.",2018,285,10.1098/rspb.2017.2613

However, despite the abundance of sequencing studies, combining data from multiple individual studies to address macroecological questions of bacterial diversity remains methodically challenging and plagued with biases. Here, using a machine-learning approach that accounts for differences among studies and complex interactions among taxa, we merge 30 independent bacterial data sets comprising 1,998 soil samples from 21 countries. Whereas previous meta-analysis efforts have focused on bacterial diversity measures or abundances of major taxa, we show that disparate amplicon sequence data can be combined at the taxonomy-based level to assess bacterial community structure. We find that rarer taxa are more important for structuring soil communities than abundant taxa, and that these rarer taxa are better predictors of community structure than environmental factors, which are often confounded across studies. We conclude that combining data from independent studies can be used to explore bacterial community dynamics, identify potential indicator taxa with an important role in structuring communities, and propose hypotheses on the factors that shape bacterial biogeography that have been overlooked in the past.",2018,3,10.1038/s41564-017-0062-x

Nonetheless, phylogenetic scale has never been formally conceptualized, and its potential remains largely unexplored. Here, we formalize the concept of phylogenetic scale, review how phylogenetic scale has been considered across multiple fields and provide practical guidelines for the use of phylogenetic scale to address a range of biological questions. Innovation: We summarize how phylogenetic scale has been treated in macroevolution, community ecology, biogeography and macroecology, illustrating how it can inform, and possibly resolve, some of the longstanding controversies in these fields. To promote the concept empirically, we define phylogenetic grain and extent, scale dependence, scaling and the domains of phylogenetic scale. We illustrate how existing phylogenetic data and statistical tools can be used to investigate the effects of scale on a variety of well-known patterns and processes, including diversification rates, community structure, niche conservatism or species-abundance distributions. Main conclusions: Explicit consideration of phylogenetic scale can provide new and more complete insight into many longstanding questions across multiple fields (macroevolution, community ecology, biogeography and macroecology). Building on the existing resources and isolated efforts across fields, future research centred on phylogenetic scale might enrich our understanding of the processes that together, but over different scales, shape the diversity of life.",2018,27,10.1111/geb.12686

After many years of lagging behind due to the difficulty of assigning both taxonomy and function to poorly distinguishable microscopic cells, microbial ecology now has access to a suite of powerful molecular tools which allow its practitioners to generate data relating to diversity and function of a microbial community on an unprecedented scale. Instead, the problem facing todays microbial ecologists is coupling the ease of generation of these datasets with the formulation and testing of workable hypotheses relating the diversity and function of environmental, host-associated, and engineered microbial communities. Here, we review the current state of knowledge regarding the links between taxonomic alpha-and beta-diversity and ecosystem function, comparing our knowledge in this area to that obtained by macroecologists who use more traditional techniques. We consider the methodologies that can be applied to study these properties and how successful they are at linking function to diversity, using examples from the study of model microbial ecosystems, methanogenic bioreactors (anaerobic digesters), and host-associated microbiota.

Here, we examined the effects of species traits, spatial extent, latitude and ecosystem type on the nestedness and turnover components of beta diversity. Location: Global. Time period: 1968-2017. Major taxa studied: From bacteria to mammals. Methods: From the 99 studies that partition total beta diversity into its turnover and nestedness components, we assembled 269 and 259 data points for the pairwise and multiple site beta-diversity metrics, respectively. Our data covered a broad variation in species dispersal type, body size and trophic position. The data were from freshwater, marine and terrestrial realms, and encompassed geographical areas from the tropics to near polar regions. We used linear modelling as a meta-regression tool to analyse the data. Results: Pairwise turnover, multiple site turnover and total beta diversity all decreased significantly with latitude. In contrast, multiple site nestedness showed a positive relationship with latitude. Beta-diversity components did not generally differ among the realms. The turnover component and total beta diversity increased with spatial extent, whereas nestedness was scale invariant for pairwise metrics. Multiple site beta-diversity components did not vary with spatial extent. Surprisingly, passively dispersed organisms had lower turnover and total beta diversity than flying organisms. Body size showed a relatively weak relationship with beta diversity but had important interactions with trophic position, thus also affecting beta diversity via interactive effects. Producers had significantly higher average pairwise turnover and total beta diversity than carnivores. Main conclusions: The present results provide evidence that species turnover, being consistently the larger component of total beta diversity, and nestedness are related to the latitude of the study area and intrinsic organismal features. We showed that two beta-diversity components had generally opposing patterns with regard to latitude. We highlight that beta-diversity partition may give additional insights into the underlying causes of spatial variability in biotic communities compared with total beta diversity alone.",2018,27,10.1111/geb.12660

Methods: A meta-analysis was conducted to examine effects of forest degradation on soil properties and microbial attributes related to microbial biomass, activity, community composition and diversity based on 408 cases from 119 studies in the world. Results: Forest degradation decreased the ratios of K-strategists to r-strategists (i.e., ratios of fungi to bacteria, Acidobacteria to Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria to Bacteroidetes and Acidobacteriaǋ択蛚狗ꮉ� to Proteobacteria֧⵺먢痫�). The response ratios (RRs) of the K-strategist to r-strategist ratios to forest degradation decreased and increased with increased RRs of soil pH and soil C to nitrogen ratio (C:N), respectively. Forest degradation increased the bacterial alpha-diversity indexes, of which the RRs increased and decreased as the RRs of soil pH and soil C: N increased, respectively. The overall RRs across all the forest degradation types ranked as microbial C (-40.4%)> soil C (-33.3%)> microbial respiration (-18.9%)> microbial C to soil C ratio (qMBC; -15.9%), leading to the RRs of microbial respiration rate per unit microbial C (qCO(2)) and soil C decomposition rate (respiration rate per unit soil C), on average, increasing by �.2 and �.0%, respectively. Variances of the RRs of qMBC and qCO(2) were significantly explained by the soil C, soil C: N and mean annual precipitation. Main conclusions: Forest degradation consistently shifted soil microbial community compositions from K-strategist dominated to r-strategist dominated, altered soil properties and stimulated microbial activity and soil C decomposition. These results are important for modelling the soil C cycling under projected global land-use changes and provide supportive evidence for applying the macroecology theory on ecosystem succession and disturbance in soil microbial ecology.",2018,27,10.1111/geb.12663

Empirical studies have documented this pattern across many different organisms and locations. Our goal was to quantify the evidence for the global LDG and the associated spatial, taxonomic and environmental factors. We performed a meta-analysis on a large number of individual LDGs that have been published in the 14 years since Hillebrands ground-breaking meta-analysis of the LDG, using meta-analysis and metaregression approaches largely new to the fields of ecology and biogeography. Location: Global. Time period: January 2003-September 2015. Major taxa studied: Bacteria, protists, plants, fungi and animals. Methods: We synthesized the outcomes of 389 individual cases of LDGs from 199 papers published since 2003, using hierarchical mixed-effects meta-analysis and multiple meta-regression. Additionally, we re-analysed Hillebrands original dataset using modern methods. Results: We confirmed the generality of the LDG, but found the pattern to be weaker than was found in Hillebrands study. We identified previously unreported variation in LDG strength and slope across longitude, with evidence that the LDG is strongest in the Western Hemisphere. Locational characteristics, such as habitat and latitude range, contributed significantly to LDG strength, whereas organismal characteristics, including taxonomic group and trophic level, did not. Modern meta-analytical models that incorporate hierarchical structure led to more conservative and sometimes contrasting effect size estimates relative to Hillebrands initial analysis, whereas metaregression revealed underlying patterns in Hillebrands dataset that were not apparent with a traditional analysis. Main conclusions: We present evidence of global latitudinal, longitudinal and habitat-based patterns in the LDG, which are apparent across both marine and terrestrial realms and over a broad taxonomic range of organisms, from bacteria to plants and vertebrates.",2018,27,10.1111/geb.12665

In order to probe, monitor, and eventually control these communities, fast detection and evaluation methods are required. In order to facilitate rapid community analysis and monitor a communitys dynamic behavior with high resolution, we here apply community flow cytometry, which provides single-cell-based high-dimensional data characterizing communities with high acuity over time. To interpret time series data, we draw inspiration from macroecology, in which a rich set of concepts has been developed for describing population dynamics. We focus on the stability paradigm as a promising candidate to interpret such data in an intuitive and actionable way and present a rapid workflow to monitor stability properties of complex microbial ecosystems. Based on single-cell data, we compute the stability properties resistance, resilience, displacement speed, and elasticity. For resilience, we also introduce a method which can be implemented for continuous online community monitoring. The proposed workflow was tested in a long-term continuous reactor experiment employing both an artificial and a complex microbial community, which were exposed to identical short-term disturbances. The computed stability properties uncovered the superior stability of the complex community and demonstrated the global applicability of the protocol to any microbiome. The workflow is able to support high temporal sample densities below bacterial generation times. This may provide new opportunities to unravel unknown ecological paradigms of natural microbial communities, with applications to environmental, biotechnological, and health-related microbiomes. IMPORTANCE Microbial communities drive many processes which affect human well-being directly, as in the human microbiome, or indirectly, as in natural environments or in biotechnological applications. Due to their complexity, their dynamics over time is difficult to monitor, and current sequence-based approaches are limited with respect to the temporal resolution. However, in order to eventually control microbial community dynamics, monitoring schemes of high temporal resolution are required. Flow cytometry provides single-cell-based data in the required temporal resolution, and we here use such data to compute stability properties as easy to interpret univariate indicators of microbial community dynamics. Such monitoring tools will allow for a fast, continuous, and cost-effective screening of stability states of microbiomes. Applicable to various environments, including bioreactors, surface water, and the human body, it will contribute to the development of control schemes to manipulate microbial community structures and performances.",2018,3,10.1128/mSphere.00564-17

We tested the algal SAR in lakes, pools and ponds of various sizes (10(-2)-10(8)m(2)) and similar hydromorphological and trophic characteristics using species-specific data and functional groups. Besides the expectation that species richness increases monotonously with area, we found a right-skewed hump-shaped relationship between the area and phytoplankton species richness. Functional richness however did not show such distortion. Differences between the area dependence of species and functional richness indicate that functional redundancy is responsible for the unusual hump-backed SAR. We demonstrated that the Small Island Effect, which is a characteristic for macroscopic SARs can also be observed for the phytoplankton. Our results imply a so-called large lake effect, which means that in case of large lakes, wind-induced mixing acts strongly against the habitat diversity and development of phytoplankton patchiness and finally results in lower phytoplankton species richness in the pelagial. High functional redundancy of the groups that prefer small-scale heterogeneity of the habitats is responsible for the unusual humpback relationship. The results lead us to conclude that although the mechanisms that regulate the richness of both microbial communities and communities of macroscopic organisms are similar, their importance can be different in micro- and macroscales.",2017,7,10.1002/ece3.3512

Biogeographical regionalization has been demonstrated for many higher taxa, such as terrestrial plants and vertebrates, but not in microbial communities. Therefore, we sought to test empirically whether microbial communities, or taxa, showpatterns consistent with biogeographical regionalization. Location: Within halite (NaCl) crystals from coastal solar salterns of western Europe, the Mediterranean and east Africa. Time period: Modern (2006-2013). Major taxa studied: Archaea. Methods: Using high-throughput Illumina amplicon sequencing, we generated the most high-resolution characterization of halite-associated archaeal communities to date, using samples from 17 locations. We grouped communities into biogeographical clusters based on community turnover to test whether these communities show biogeographical regionalization. To examine whether individual taxa, rather than communities, show biogeographical patterns, we also tested whether the relative abundance of individual genera may be indicative of a communitys biogeographical origins using machine learning methods, specifically random forest classification. Results: We found that the rate of community turnover was greatest over subregional spatial scales (< 500 km), whereas at regional spatial scales the turnover was independent of geographical distance. Biogeographical clusters of communities were either not statistically robust or lacked spatial coherence, inconsistent with biogeographical regionalization. However, we identified several archaeal genera that were good indicators of biogeographical origin, providing classification error rates of <10%. Main conclusions: Overall, our results provide little support for the concept of biogeographical regions in these extremophilic microbial communities, despite the fact that some taxa do show biogeographical patterns. We suggest that variable dispersal ability among the halite-associated Archaea may disrupt biogeographical patterns at the community level, preventing the formation of biogeographical regions. This means that the processes that lead to the formation of biogeographical regions operate differentially on individual microbial taxa rather than on entire communities.",2017,26,10.1111/geb.12670

However, many of the statistical issues that plague such analyses in macroscale communities remain unresolved for microbial communities. Here, we discuss problems in the analysis of microbial species correlations based on presence-absence data. We focus on presence-absence data because this information is more readily obtainable from sequencing studies, especially for whole-genome sequencing, where abundance estimation is still in its infancy. First, we show how Pearsons correlation coefficient (r) and Jaccards index (J)-two of the most common metrics for correlation analysis of presence-absence data-can contradict each other when applied to a typical microbiome dataset. In our dataset, for example, 14% of species-pairs predicted to be significantly correlated by r were not predicted to be significantly correlated using J, while 37.4% of species-pairs predicted to be significantly correlated by J were not predicted to be significantly correlated using r. Mismatch was particularly common among species-pairs with at least one rare species (<10% prevalence), explaining why r and J might differ more strongly in microbiome datasets, where there are large numbers of rare taxa. Indeed 74% of all species-pairs in our study had at least one rare species. Next, we show how Pearsons correlation coefficient can result in artificial inflation of positive taxon relationships and how this is a particular problem for microbiome studies. We then illustrate how Jaccards index of similarity (J) can yield improvements over Pearsons correlation coefficient. However, the standard null model for Jaccards index is flawed, and thus introduces its own set of spurious conclusions. We thus identify a better null model based on a hypergeometric distribution, which appropriately corrects for species prevalence. This model is available from recent statistics literature, and can be used for evaluating the significance of any value of an empirically observed Jaccards index. The resulting simple, yet effective method for handling correlation analysis of microbial presence-absence datasets provides a robust means of testing and finding relationships and/or shared environmental responses among microbial taxa.",2017,12,10.1371/journal.pone.0187132
"Ryo, M; Rillig, MC",Statistically reinforced machine learning for nonlinear patterns and variable interactions,ECOSPHERE,"Most statistical models assume linearity and few variable interactions, even though real-world ecological patterns often result from nonlinear and highly interactive processes. We here introduce a set of novel empirical modeling techniques which can address this mismatch: statistically reinforced machine learning. We demonstrate the behaviors of three techniques (conditional inference tree, model-based tree, and permutation-based random forest) by analyzing an artificially generated example dataset that contains patterns based on nonlinearity and variable interactions. The results show the potential of statistically reinforced machine learning algorithms to detect nonlinear relationships and higher-order interactions. Estimation reliability for any technique, however, depended on sample size. The applications of statistically reinforced machine learning approaches would be particularly beneficial for investigating (1) novel patterns for which shapes cannot be assumed a priori, (2) higher-order interactions which are often overlooked in parametric statistics, (3) context dependency where patterns change depending on other conditions, (4) significance and effect sizes of variables while taking nonlinearity and variable interactions into account, and (5) a hypothesis using parametric statistics after identifying patterns using statistically reinforced machine learning techniques.",2017,8,10.1002/ecs2.1976
"Zaoli, S; Giometto, A; Maritan, A; Rinaldo, A",Covariations in ecological scaling laws fostered by community dynamics,PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,"Scaling laws in ecology, intended both as functional relationships among ecologically relevant quantities and the probability distributions that characterize their occurrence, have long attracted the interest of empiricists and theoreticians. Empirical evidence exists of power laws associated with the number of species inhabiting an ecosystem, their abundances, and traits. Although their functional form appears to be ubiquitous, empirical scaling exponents vary with ecosystem type and resource supply rate. The idea that ecological scaling laws are linked has been entertained before, but the full extent of macroecological pattern covariations, the role of the constraints imposed by finite resource supply, and a comprehensive empirical verification are still unexplored. Here, we propose a theoretical scaling framework that predicts the linkages of several macroecological patterns related to species abundances and body sizes. We show that such a framework is consistent with the stationary-state statistics of a broad class of resource-limited community dynamics models, regardless of parameterization and model assumptions. We verify predicted theoretical covariations by contrasting empirical data and provide testable hypotheses for yet unexplored patterns. We thus place the observed variability of ecological scaling exponents into a coherent statistical framework where patterns in ecology embed constrained fluctuations.",2017,114,10.1073/pnas.1708376114

However, the drivers of microbial diversity are complex and the pathways of these drivers effects are to date largely unresolved, especially in freshwaters. We disentangled the causal direct and indirect effects of climate, land cover and water chemistry on stream diatom communities using hierarchical settings. Location: Finland, a geographical gradient of c. 1200 km (60 degrees-70 degrees N). Methods: We used structural equation modelling (SEM) to analyse patterns in diatom richness, composition and the uniqueness of species composition in 143 streams. The community composition was defined as the value of the first axis in non-metric multidimensional scaling and the uniqueness of species composition of each site as its local contribution to beta diversity. Results: Species richness was mainly affected directly by energy and resource availability, increasing with nutrients but decreasing with growing degree days (GDD). The community composition was strongly influenced directly by conductivity and mainly indirectly by anthropogenic land use but also to a lesser degree by GDD (directly and indirectly), indirectly by precipitation and directly by the amount of boreal wetlands. The uniqueness of species composition increased with conductivity but decreased with nutrient concentrations with high number of unique species in southernmost and northernmost sites. Main conclusions: Our SEM analyses revealed some of the important links between climate, land cover and water chemistry, all of which influenced the microbial diversity. Energy availability has varying indirect and direct effects on diatom communities regardless of local stream conditions, whereas land cover patterns affect aquatic communities most likely indirectly through water chemistry. Collectively, these results suggest that it is important to consider environmental variables simultaneously at different hierarchically ordered scales in macroecological and biogeographical research.",2017,44,10.1111/jbi.13046

Here we modelled the global diversity of symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi using currently available data on AM fungal molecular diversity (small subunit (SSU) ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequences) in field samples. To differentiate between regional and local effects, we estimated species pools (sets of potentially suitable taxa) for each site, which are expected to reflect regional processes. We then calculated community completeness, an index showing the fraction of the species pool present, which is expected to reflect local processes. We found significant spatial variation, globally in species pool size, as well as in local and dark diversity (absent members of the species pool). Species pool size was larger close to areas containing tropical grasslands during the last glacial maximum, which are possible centres of diversification. Community completeness was greater in regions of high wilderness (remoteness from human disturbance). Local diversity was correlated with wilderness and current connectivity to mountain grasslands. Applying the species pool concept to symbiotic fungi facilitated a better understanding of how biodiversity can be jointly shaped by large-scale historical processes and recent human disturbance.",2017,216,10.1111/nph.14695

We provide a continental-scale assessment of dominant reef habitats through analysis of macroalgae and sessile animal taxa at sites distributed around Australia. Relationships between reef habitats and environmental and anthropogenic factors are assessed, and potential changes in the future distribution and persistence of habitats are considered. LocationShallow rocky and coral reefs around the Australian coast. MethodsCover of 38 sessile biota functional groups was recorded in diver-based surveys using quadrats at 1,299 sites. Classification analyses based on the functional groups were used to identify an unambiguous set of biogenic habitat types. Random forest and distance-based linear modelling were used to investigate correlations between these habitats and environmental and anthropogenic variables. ResultsCluster analyses revealed tropical and temperate realms in benthic substratum composition, each with finer-scale habitats: four for the temperate realm (canopy algae, barren, epiphytic algae-understorey and turf) and five for the tropical realm (coral, coral-bacterial mat, turf-coral, calcified algae-coral and foliose algae). Habitats were correlated with different sets of environmental and anthropogenic conditions, with key associations in the temperate realm between mean sea temperature and canopy-forming algae (negative) and barren habitat (positive). Variation in sea temperature was also an important correlate in the tropical realm. Main conclusionsQuantitative delineation of inshore reef habitats at a continental scale identifies many of the same habitat types traditionally recognized through subjective methods. Importantly, many biogenic reef habitats were closely related to environmental parameters and anthropogenic variables that are predicted to change. Consequently, habitats have differing likelihood of persistence. Structurally complex habitats in the temperate realm are at greater risk than more two-dimensional habitats (e.g., canopy-forming versus turfing algae). In the tropical realm, offshore and coastal habitats differed greatly, highlighting the importance of large-scale oceanic conditions in shaping biogenic structure.",2017,26,10.1111/geb.12620

In order to produce a broad and general assessment of the invasion pattern in aquatic habitats we here propose a macroecological approach to assess the drivers of occurrence of alien species within the whole biota (microorganisms, plants and animals) across several natural freshwater ecosystems of Italy. We simultaneously tested three groups of variables (propagule pressure, abiotic and biotic characteristics), selected as putative predictors of invasibility of a site. Propagule pressure, expressed as proximity to larger inhabited areas, and differences in the native species richness of the receiving community, had a significant role in determining the number of alien species occurrences. Furthermore, body size influenced the occurrence and colonization processes of alien species. Finally, climatic characteristics were relevant in determining the chances that a site was invaded, confirming the role of these abiotic filters in the invasion process.",2017,12,10.3391/ai.2017.12.3.04

Utilizing previously collected specimens to study patterns of fungal diversity could significantly increase our understanding of overall patterns of biodiversity from snapshots in time. Here, we investigated the fungi inhabiting the phylloplane among species of the endemic Hawaiian plant genus, Clermontin (Campanulaceae). Utilizing next generation DNA amplicon sequencing, we uncovered approximately 1,780 fungal operational taxonomic nits from just 20 DNA bank samples collected throughout the main Hawaiian Islands.

These microbes are keystone organisms of soil ecosystems and regulate essential processes of soil fertility such as nutrient cycling and plant growth. Despite this, protists have received little scientific attention, especially compared to bacteria, fungi and nematodes in soil studies. Recent methodological advances, particularly in molecular biology techniques, have made the study of soil protists more accessible, and have created a resurgence of interest in soil protistology. This ongoing revolution now enables comprehensive investigations of the structure and functioning of soil protist communities, paving the way to a new era in soil biology. Instead of providing an exhaustive review, we provide a synthesis of research gaps that should be prioritized in future studies of soil protistology to guide this rapidly developing research area. Based on a synthesis of expert opinion we propose 30 key questions covering a broad range of topics including evolution, phylogenetics, functional ecology, macroecology, paleoecology, and methodologies. These questions highlight a diversity of topics that will establish soil protistology as a hub discipline connecting different fundamental and applied fields such as ecology, biogeography, evolution, plant-microbe interactions, agronomy, and conservation biology. We are convinced that soil protistology has the potential to be one of the most exciting frontiers in biology. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2017,111,10.1016/j.soilbio.2017.04.001
"Duarte, S; Cassio, F; Pascoal, C; Barlocher, F",Taxa-area relationship of aquatic fungi on deciduous leaves,PLOS ONE,"One of the fundamental patterns in macroecology is the increase in the number of observed taxa with size of sampled area. For microbes, the shape of this relationship remains less clear. The current study assessed the diversity of aquatic fungi, by the traditional approach based on conidial morphology (captures reproducing aquatic hyphomycetes) and next generation sequencing (NGS; captures other fungi as well), on graded sizes of alder leaves (0.6 to 13.6 cm(2)). Leaves were submerged in two streams in geographically distant locations: the Oliveira Stream in Portugal and the Boss Brook in Canada. Decay rates of alder leaves and fungal sporulation rates did not differ between streams. Fungal biomass was higher in Boss Brook than in Oliveira Stream, and in both streams almost 100% of the reads belonged to active fungal taxa. In general, larger leaf areas tended to harbour more fungi, but these findings were not consistent between techniques. Morphospecies-based diversity increased with leaf area in Boss Brook, but not in Oliveira Stream; metabarcoding data showed an opposite trend. The higher resolution of metabarcoding resulted in steeper taxa-accumulation curves than morphospecies-based assessments (fungal conidia morphology). Fungal communities assessed by metabarcoding were spatially structured by leaf area in both streams. Metabarcoding promises greater resolution to assess biodiversity patterns in aquatic fungi and may be more accurate for assessing taxa-area relationships and local to global diversity ratios.",2017,12,10.1371/journal.pone.0181545
"Hendershot, JN; Read, QD; Henning, JA; Sanders, NJ; Classen, AT",Consistently inconsistent drivers of microbial diversity and abundance at macroecological scales,ECOLOGY,"Macroecology seeks to understand broad-scale patterns in the diversity and abundance of organisms, but macroecologists typically study aboveground macroorganisms. Belowground organisms regulate numerous ecosystem functions, yet we lack understanding of what drives their diversity. Here, we examine the controls on belowground diversity along latitudinal and elevational gradients. We performed a global meta-analysis of 325 soil communities across 20 studies conducted along temperature and soil pH gradients. Belowground taxa, whether bacterial or fungal, observed along a given gradient of temperature or soil pH were equally likely to show a linear increase, linear decrease, humped pattern, trough-shaped pattern, or no pattern in diversity along the gradient. Land-use intensity weakly affected the diversity-temperature relationship, but no other factor did so. Our study highlights disparities among diversity patterns of soil microbial communities. Belowground diversity may be controlled by the associated climatic and historical contexts of particular gradients, by factors not typically measured in community-level studies, or by processes operating at scales that do not match the temporal and spatial scales under study. Because these organisms are responsible for a suite of key processes, understanding the drivers of their distribution and diversity is fundamental to understanding the functioning of ecosystems.",2017,98,10.1002/ecy.1829

Ecological sub-disciplines, particularly conservation, community ecology and macroecology, all recognize the value of evolutionary relationships but the resulting development of phylogenetic approaches has led to a proliferation of phylogenetic diversity metrics. The use of many metrics across the sub-disciplines hampers potential meta-analyses, syntheses, and generalizations of existing results. Further, there is no guide for selecting the appropriatemetric for a given question, and different metrics are frequently used to address similar questions. To improve the choice, application, and interpretation of phylo-diversity metrics, we organize existing metrics by expanding on a unifying framework for phylogenetic information. Generally, questions about phylogenetic relationships within or between assemblages tend to ask three types of question: how much; how different; or how regular? We show that these questions reflect three dimensions of a phylogenetic tree: richness, divergence, and regularity. We classify 70 existing phylo-diversity metrics based on their mathematical form within these three dimensions and identify anchor representatives: for alpha-diversity metrics these are PD (Faiths phylogenetic diversity), MPD (mean pairwise distance), and VPD (variation of pairwise distances). By analysing mathematical formulae and using simulations, we use this framework to identify metrics that mix dimensions, and we provide a guide to choosing and using the most appropriate metrics. We show that metric choice requires connecting the research question with the correct dimension of the framework and that there are logical approaches to selecting and interpreting metrics.

Ower the past decade, microbial ecologists have produced the largest ever community datasets. However, these data are rarely used to uncover law-like patterns of commonness and rarity, test theories of biodiversity, or explore unifying explanations for the structure of microbial communities. Using a global scale compilation of >20,000 samples from environmental, engineered and host-related ecosystems, we test the power of competing theories to predict distributions of microbial abundance and diversity-abundance scaling laws. We show that these patterns are best explained by the synergistic interaction of stochastic processes that are captured by lognormal dynamics. We demonstrate that lognormal dynamics have predictive power across scales of abundance, a criterion that is essential to biodiversity theory.

Genomic techniques are providing new insights into the structure of fungal populations, revealing hitherto undescribed fine-scale adaptations to environments and hosts that govern their emergence as infections. Cryptococcal meningitis is a neglected tropical disease that is responsible for a large proportion of AIDS-related deaths across Africa; however, the ecological determinants that underlie a patients risk of infection remain largely unexplored. Here, we use genome sequencing and ecological genomics to decipher the evolutionary ecology of the aetiological agents of cryptococcal meningitis, Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii, across the central African country of Zambia. We show that the occurrence of these two pathogens is differentially associated with biotic (macroecological) and abiotic (physical) factors across two key African ecoregions, Central Miombo woodlands and Zambezi Mopane woodlands. We show that speciation of Cryptococcus has resulted in adaptation to occupy different ecological niches, with C.neoformans found to occupy Zambezi Mopane woodlands and C.gattii primarily recovered from Central Miombo woodlands. Genome sequencing shows that C.neoformans causes 95% of human infections in this region, of which over three-quarters belonged to the globalized lineage VNI. We show that VNI infections are largely associated with urbanized populations in Zambia. Conversely, the majority of C.neoformans isolates recovered in the environment belong to the genetically diverse African-endemic lineage VNB, and we show hitherto unmapped levels of genomic diversity within this lineage.

We test fundamental hypotheses of macroecological theories, showing that both taxonomic and functional classifications have distinct biogeographical variation across distance and environments depending on trophic composition. LocationStudies spanning the global oceans. MethodsTaxonomic and functional profiles were obtained from metagenomes and were compared across oceanographic regions and tested for patterns of co-occurrence. The influences of sampling method (filter size), environmental variables and geographical distribution were compared with distance-based linear models to test predictors of taxonomic and functional composition. Macroecological drivers were compared with bacterial community structure to test four biogeographical hypotheses: (1) no biogeographical patterns, (2) community structure reflects environmental dissimilarity, (3) community structure reflects distance, (4) community structure reflects environment and distance. ResultsBacterial families were clustered into four trophic groups - phototrophic, oligotrophic, eutrophic and copiotrophic - by changes in abundance across oceanographic regions and co-occurrence with core functions. Changes in community composition were best modelled by longitude for free-living communities and dissolved oxygen for mixed communities of free-living and particle-associated bacteria. Both microhabitat and community assignment had an impact on biogeographical patterns, with taxonomic compositions following our hypotheses 2 and 4 and functional gene compositions following hypotheses 3 and 4. Main conclusionsWe described four trophic groups adding to the current dichotomy of the classification of marine bacteria as oligotrophic or copiotrophic. Taxonomic composition of mixed communities reflected environmental differences but not geographical distance, whereas functional gene composition in free-living communities was independent of environmental dissimilarity and reflected geographical distance. Patterns of biogeography in bacterial communities differed depending on the description of taxa or function. Therefore, we developed a new paradigm for bacterial ecology which shows that some aspects of bacterial evolution depend on trophic complexity, history and current environmental conditions.",2017,26,10.1111/geb.12528
