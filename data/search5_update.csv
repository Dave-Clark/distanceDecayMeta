"Blanco, S; Olenici, A; Ortega, F; Jimenez-Gomez, F; Guerrero, F",Identifying environmental drivers of benthic diatom diversity: the case of Mediterranean mountain ponds,PEERJ,"This study aims at elucidating the environmental factors controlling benthic diatom diversity and uniqueness in Mediterranean mountain ponds. Samples of periphytic diatoms were collected in 45 ponds in Andalusia, south of Spain, and analysed by standard methods. Data analysis reveals that diatom diversity is mainly controlled by elevation and hydroperiod. Contrary to the usual findings in the literature, the highest scores on Shannons diversity index were found in high-elevation temporary ponds, but this effect is hidden by lake clustering in the analysed dataset. Significant distance-decay similarity (DDS) trends were detected in the analysis of floristic composition among the samples, stressing the importance of spatial factors that may override the effect of other abiotic factors. These findings highlight the role of isolation and dispersal limitation in the configuration of the biogeographical patterns of benthic diatoms.",2020,8,10.7717/peerj.8825

However, large knowledge gaps remain with regard to community assembly processes and inter taxa associations. Here, using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and qPCR, we investigated the spatiotemporal dynamics, assembly processes, and co-occurrence relationships of the archaeal community in 58 surface sediment samples collected in both summer and winter from across similar to 1500 km of the eastern Chinese marginal seas. Clear patterns in spatiotemporal dynamics in the archaeal community structure were observed, with a more pronounced spatial rather than seasonal variation. Accompanying the geographic variation was a significant distance-decay pattern with varying contributions from different archaeal clades, determined by their relative abundance. In both seasons, dispersal limitation was the most important process, explaining similar to 40% of the community variation, followed by homogeneous selection and ecological drift, that made an approximately equal contribution (similar to 30%). This meant that stochasticity rather than determinism had a greater impact on the archaeal community assembly. Furthermore, we observed seasonality in archaeal co-occurrence patterns: closer inter-taxa connections in winter than in summer, and unmatched geographic patterns between community composition and co-occurrence relationship. These results demonstrate that the benthic archaeal community was assembled under a seasonal-consistent mechanism but the co-occurrence relationships changed over the seasons, indicating complex archaeal dynamic patterns in coastal sediments of the eastern Chinese marginal seas.",,,10.1038/s41396-020-0621-7

Unraveling the mechanisms underlying the spatial assembly process of both abundant and rare bacterial taxa has become a central goal in microbial ecology. Here, we used high-throughput sequencing to explore geographic patterns and the relative importance of ecological processes in the assembly of abundant and rare bacterial subcommunities from 25 lakes across the middle and lower reaches of Yangtze River basin (MLYB), located in Southeast China, where most of the lakes are interconnected by river networks. We found similar biogeographic patterns of abundant and rare subcommunities which could significantly distinguish the community compositions of the two lake groups that were far from each other but which could not distinguish the community compositions of the nearby lakes. Both abundant and rare bacteria followed a strong distance-decay relationship. These findings suggest that the interconnectivity between lakes homogenizes the bacterial communities in local areas, and the abundant and rare taxa therein may be affected by the same ecological process. In addition, based on the measured environmental variables, the deterministic processes explain a small fraction of variation within both abundant and rare subcommunities, while both neutral and null models revealed a high stochasticity ratio for the spatial distribution patterns of both abundant and rare taxa. These findings indicate that the stochastic processes exhibited a greater influence on both abundant and rare bacterial subcommunity assemblies among interconnected lakes. IMPORTANCE The middle and lower Yangtze Plain is a typical floodplain in which many lakes connect with each other, especially in the wet season. More importantly, with the frequent change of regional water level in the wet season, there is a mutual hydrodynamic exchange among these lakes. The microbial biogeography among these interconnected lakes is still poorly understood. This study aims to unravel the mechanisms underlying the assembly process of abundant and rare bacteria among the interconnected lakes in the middle and lower Yangtze Plain. Our findings will provide a deeper understanding of the biogeographic patterns of rare and abundant bacterial taxa and their determined processes among interconnected aquatic habitats.",2020,86,10.1128/AEM.02423-19

Microbial composition of biocrusts exhibits significant geographical patterns, but the regulation of biocrust development on the geographical patterns in unclear. In this study, we examined bacterial communities from cyanobacterial-lichen and moss crust soils in five desert habitats in northern China, and evaluated the relative importance of environmental factors and biocrust development versus geographic distance to the distance-decay relationship. To explore the effects of the sampling scale on geographical patterns, we also examined soil bacterial communities along the slope of sand dunes. Across the five desert habitats, bacterial a-diversity, phylogenetic diversity, and the dominant bacterial phyla in cyanobacteriallichen crusts did not increase consistently with precipitation increase, instead bacterial community composition was mainly impacted by soil nutrients (SOC, TP) and biocrust development (thickness, cover and Chl a). Bacterial p-diversity in both cyanobacterial-lichen and moss crusts showed strong distance-decay relationships across the landscape scale; bacterial community composition in cyanobacterial-lichen crusts differed significantly among five desert habitats. Environmental and biocrust development variables explained bacterial community variation better than geographic distance, suggesting a weaker influence of dispersal limitation on the bacterial communities in biocrusts. In addition, the distance-decay rate was higher at the slope than that at the landscape scale, suggesting a fast turnover rate of bacterial community communities induced by topography. Our study implies that soil attributes and biocrust development have more profound impacts on soil bacterial communities than precipitation, which provides novel insights into the geographical distribution and assemblage of soil bacterial communities in deserts. Moreover, our study is significant with respect to understanding the potential responses of soil microbial communities to climate change in desert areas under the scenario of increasing precipitation variation.",2020,142,10.1016/j.soilbio.2020.107721

The composition and abundances of benthic archaeal communities were examined from a coastal lagoon; Chilika (India) which is experiencing an intense pressure from anthropogenic and natural factors. High-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA genes revealed that sediment (n = 96) archaeal communities were largely composed of Crenarchaeota (18.76%), Euryarchaeota (18.34%), Thaumarchaeota (13.45%), Woesearchaeota (10.05%), and Pacearchaeota (4.21%). Archaeal Laxa affiliated to methanogens, sulfate-reducers, and ammonia-oxidizers were detected suggesting that carbon, sulfur, and nitrogen cycles might be prominent in benthic sediments. Salinity, total organic carbon, available nitrogen, available phosphorus, macrophyte (Phragmites karka) and inter-taxa relationships between community members and with bacterial communities played steering roles in structuring the archaeal communities. Marine sites with mesohaline-polyhaline regime were dominated by Nitrosopumilus and Thaumarchaeota. In contrast, riverine sites with oligohaline regime demonstrated a higher abundance of Thermoprotei. Macrophyte dominated zones were enriched in Methanomicrobia and Methanobacteria in their rhizosphere sediments, whereas, bulk (un-vegetated) sediments were dominated by Nitrosopurmilus. Spatial patterns in archaeal communities demonstrated distance-decay patterns which were correlated with changes in physicochemical factors over geographical distances. Heterotrophic microbial communities showed much higher metabolic diversity and activity in their carbon utilization profiles in rhizosphere sediments than the bulk sediments. This baseline information on benthic archaea and their environmental drivers would be useful to assess the impact of anthropogenic and natural pressures on these communities and associated biogeochemical cycles.

Coastal bacterioplankton communities are highly dynamic due to spatiotemporal heterogeneity in the environmental parameters. We investigated the seasonal and spatial variation in bacterioplankton communities, their abundances and environmental drivers during one year period in Chilika, a brackish water coastal lagoon of India. High-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA genes of bacterioplankton communities showed that they were dominated by heterotrophs namely alpha-Proteobacteria SAR11 and their sub-clades (SAR11_Ib Chesapeake-Delaware_Bay, Candidatus_Pelagibacter, and SAR11_Surface_1), acti-nobacterial lineages (hgcI, CL500-29, and Candidatus_Aquiluna), beta-Proteobacteria MWH-UniP1 , beta-Proteobacteria OM43, and verrucomicrobial Glade Spartobacteria LD29. Synechococcus was the dominant member within autotrophic cyanobacterial community. Response ratio derived from comparisons of taxon-specific absolute abundances and indicator analyses showed that SAR11_Surface_1 sub-Glade occupied high-salinity environment especially during summer and winter and emerged as a strong indicator for mesohaline-polyhaline salinity regime. In contrast, Spartobacteria LD29, Actinobacteria hgcI, and CL500-29 preferred low-salinity freshwater environment and were strong indicators for oligohaline-mesohaline regimes. Spatiotemporal patterns were governed by distance-decay and similarity-time relationships. Bacterioplankton communities were mostly determined by salinity, dissolved oxygen, phosphate, and pH which resulted species sorting leading to biogeographical patterns in the bacterioplankton communities. Modeling analysis revealed the characteristic shift in the indicator bacterioplankton taxa along with estuarine salinity gradient. This study has provided baseline information on the bacterioplankton communities and their environmental drivers within an anthropogenically impacted cyclone prone coastal lagoon which would be useful in assessing the impact of multiple stressors on this vulnerable ecosystem.

We address this question through an analysis of the land use surrounding 46 inter-connected lakes located within seven different drainage basins in northern Germany, and the microbiomes of these lakes during early summer. Lake microbiome structure was not correlated with the specific drainage basin or by basin size, and bacterial distribution did not seem to be limited by distance. Instead, land use within the drainage basin could predict, to some extent, NO2  NO3 concentrations in the water, which (together with temperature, chlorophyll a and total phosphorus) correlated to some extent with the water microbiome structure. Land use directly surrounding the water bodies, however, had little observable effects on water quality or the microbiome. Several microbial lineages, including Cyanobacteria and Verrucomicrobia, were differentially partitioned between the lakes. Significantly more data, including time-series measurements of land use and water chemical properties, are needed to fully understand the interaction between the environment and the organization of microbial communities.",2020,11,10.3389/fmicb.2020.00089

However, little is known about the biogeographic assemblies of these communities, especially in large rivers suffering from cascade dam regulation. Here, we used a 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing approach to investigate the biogeographic patterns and underlying assembly mechanisms of abundant and rare bacterioplankton taxa in cascade reservoirs of the Jinsha River in China. The results revealed species loss of bacterioplankton due to dam construction, which was more significant for rare taxa than for abundant ones. The distributions of abundant and rare taxa exhibited similar spatial and temporal patterns, which were significantly distinct between winter and summer and between upstream and downstream reservoirs. Both spatial (dispersal-related process) and environmental (selection process) factors seemed to together govern the assembly and biogeography of abundant and rare taxa, although both factors explained only a small fraction of variation in the rare taxa. More importantly, environmental factors explained more community variation in abundant sub-community than that in rare sub-community. Co-occurrence network analysis revealed that abundant species with closer interactions were more often located in a central position of the network compared with rare species. Nevertheless, half of the keystone species were rare species and may play important roles in maintaining the network stability. Overall, these findings indicate that distinct assembly mechanisms underlie the similar biogeography of rare and abundant bacteria in cascade reservoirs of a large river.",2020,11,10.3389/fmicb.2020.00158

The results showed that each integrated WWTP (IWWTP) received higher abundance of ARGs than pharmaceutical WWTPs (PWWTPs), and IWWTPs removed ARGs more efficiently than PWWTPs. The WWTP effluents greatly contributed to the ARGs pollution in the water environments of the ERAs and HZB, and the total abundance of the ARGs displayed a distance decay pattern. In coastal sediments, more ARGs were accumulated in remote sites. The correlation analysis showed that the occurrence of ARGs was more related to 16S rDNA and intI1 in the WWTPs. Three macrolides resistance genes (ermB, mphA, and vatB) had strong correlations with 16S rDNA and intI1 in all the sample groups.

Freshwaters, one of the most threatened ecosystems in the world, offer a valuable context to study biodiversity patterns of distinct organism groups in relation to climatic variation. In the Tibetan Plateau biodiversity hotspot - Hengduan Mountain region, we studied the effects of climate and local physico-chemical factors on stream microorganisms (i.e. bacteria) and macroorganisms (i.e. macroinvertebrates) in two parallel catchments with contrasting precipitation and temperature, that is, the Nujiang and Lancang Rivers. Diversities and community structures were better explained by climatic and local environmental variables in the drier and colder catchment and at higher elevations, than in the warmer and wetter conditions and at lower elevations. This suggests that communities may be more strongly assembled by deterministic processes in the former, comparatively harsher conditions, compared to the latter, more benign conditions. Macroinvertebrates were more strongly affected by climatic and local environmental factors compared to bacteria, but the diversities and community structures of the two groups showed spatially similar responses to overall abiotic variation, being especially evident with their community structures responses to climate. Furthermore, bacterial and macroinvertebrate diversities were positively correlated in the drier and colder catchment, implying that these biologically and ecologically distinct organism groups are likely to be driven by similar processes in areas with such climatic conditions. We conclude that changes in climatic and local environmental conditions may affect the diversity of macroorganisms more strongly than that of microorganisms, at least in subtropical mountainous stream ecosystems studied here, but simultaneous responses of both groups to environmental changes can also be expected.

While strong patterns of host specificity have been observed consistently in sponge microbiomes, the precise ecological relationships between hosts and their symbiotic microbial communities remain to be fully delineated. In the current study, we investigate the relative roles of host population genetics and biogeography in structuring the microbial communities hosted by the excavating sponge Cliona delitrix. A total of 53 samples, previously used to demarcate the population genetic structure of C. delitrix, were selected from two locations in the Caribbean Sea and from eight locations across the reefs of Florida and the Bahamas. Microbial community diversity and composition were measured using Illumina-based high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA V4 region and related to host population structure and geographic distribution. Most operational taxonomic units (OTUs) specific to Cliona delitrix microbiomes were rare, while other OTUs were shared with congeneric hosts. Across a large regional scale (>1,000 km), geographic distance was associated with considerable variability of the sponge microbiome, suggesting a distance-decay relationship, but little impact over smaller spatial scales (<300 km) was observed. Host population structure had a moderate effect on the structure of these microbial communities, regardless of geographic distance. These results support the interplay between geographic, environmental, and host factors as forces determining the community structure of microbiomes associated with C. delitrix. Moreover, these data suggest that the mechanisms of host regulation can be observed at the population genetic scale, prior to the onset of speciation.",2020,10,10.1002/ece3.6033

Here, red paddy soils in subtropical China were collected across a soil depth profile, comprising 0-to-10-cm- (0-10cm-), 10-20cm-, and 20-40cm-deep layers. Using IIlumina MiSeq amplicon sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, distance-decay relationships (DDRs), and ecological models, fungal assemblages and their spatial patterns were investigated from each soil depth. We observed significant spatial variation in fungal communities and found that environmental heterogeneity decreased with soil depth, while spatial variation in fungal communities showed the opposite trend. DDRs occurred only in 0-10cm- and 10-20cm-deep soil layers, not in the 20-40cm layer. Our analyses revealed that the fungal community assembly in the 0-10cm layer was primarily governed by environmental filtering and a high dispersal rate, while in the deeper layer (20-40cm), it was primarily governed by dispersal limitation with minimal environmental filtering. Both environmental filtering and dispersal limitation controlled fungal community assembly in the 10-20cm layer, with dispersal limitation playing the major role. Results demonstrate the decreasing importance of environmental filtering and an increase in the importance of dispersal limitation in structuring fungal communities from shallower to deeper soils. Effectively, everything is everywhere, but the environment selects, although only in shallower soils that are easily accessible to dispersive fungal propagules. This work highlights that perceived drivers of fungal community assembly are dependent on sampling depth, suggesting that caution is required when interpreting diversity patterns from samples that integrate across depths. IMPORTANCE In this work, IIlumina MiSeq amplicon sequencing of the ITS region was used to investigate the spatial variation and assembly mechanisms of fungal communities from different soil layers across paddy fields in subtropical China, and the results demonstrate the decreasing importance of environmental filtering and an increase in the importance of dispersal limitation in structuring fungal communities from shallower to deeper soils. Therefore, the results of this study highlight that perceived drivers of fungal community assembly are dependent on sampling depth and suggest that caution is required when interpreting diversity patterns from samples that integrate across depths.

Despite the efficacy of QQ on biofouling, it is elusive how QQ influences biofilm formation on membranes. A pilot-scale QQ-MBR and non-QQ-MBR were identically operated for 4 days and 8 days to destructively sample the membranes. QQ prolonged the membrane filterability by 43% with no harmful influence on MBR performance. qPCR showed no effect of QQ on microbial density during either of these time periods. Community comparisons revealed that QQ influenced the bacterial and fungal community structures, and the fungal structure corresponded with the bacterial structure. Metacommunity and spatial analyses showed that QQ induced structural variation rather than compositional variation of bacteria and fungi. Moreover, QQ considerably enhanced the bacterial dispersal across membrane during the early development. As the dispersal enhancement by QQ counteracted the ecological drift, it eliminated the distance-decay relationship, reflecting a neutral theory archetype of metacommunity. Network analyses showed that QQ substantially reduced the amount and magnitude of interactions, e.g., competition and cooperation, for bacteria and fungi, and weakened their network structures, irrespective of time. Additionally, QQ suppressed the growth of specific microbial species (e.g., Acinetobacter), abundant and widespread at the early stage.

However, the extent to which geographic distance can affect marine microbial communities is still unclear, especially for the microbial communities in well-connected surface seawaters. In this study, the bacterial community compositions of 21 surface seawater samples, that were distributed over a distance of 7800 km, were surveyed to investigate how bacterial community similarity changes with increasing geographical distance. Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes were the dominant bacterial phyla, with Proteobacteria accounting for 52.6-92.5% and Bacteroidetes comprising 3.5-46.9% of the bacterial communities. A significant bacterial distance-decay relationship was observed in the well-connected Southern Ocean surface seawater. The number of pairwise shared operational taxonomic units (OTUs), and community similarities tended to decrease with increasing geographic distance. Calculation of the similarity indices with all, abundant or rare OTUs did not affect the observed distance-decay relationship. Spatial distance can largely explain the observed bacterial community variation. This study shows that even in well-connected surface waters, bacterial distance-decay patterns can be found as long as the geographical distance is great enough.

In this study, significant organic pollution index (OPI) and offshore distance gradients, as respective proxies of disturbance intensity and disturbance frequency, were detected in a regional scale across the East China Sea. A multiple regression on matrices (MRM) revealed that the biogeography of bacterioplankton community depended on spatial scale, which was governed by local characters. Bacterioplankton community compositions (BCCs) were primarily governed by the conjointly direct (-0.28) and indirect (-0.48) effects of OPI, while offshore distance contributed a large indirectly effect (0.52). A SEGMENTED analysis depicted non-linear responses of BCCs to increasing disturbance intensity and disturbance frequency, as evidenced by significant tipping points. This was also true for the dominant bacterial phyla. Notably, we screened 30 OPI-discriminatory taxa that could quantitatively diagnose coastal OPI levels, with an overall 79.3% accuracy. Collectively, the buffer capacity of bacterioplankton communities to increasing disturbance intensity and disturbance frequency is limited, of which the significant tipping points afford a warning line for coastal management.

They support habitats that can switch quickly from terrestrial to aquatic along the year. Diversity of animals and plants, and the connexion between communities in different basins have been widely explored in these habitats, but hardly any research has been carried out on microorganisms. The aim of this study is to provide the first insights on the diversity of eukaryotic microbial communities from these environments. Due to the ephemeral nature of these aquatic environments, we predict that the granitic basins should host a high proportion of dormant microeukaryotes. Based on an environmental DNA diversity survey, we reveal diverse communities with representatives of all major eukaryotic taxonomic supergroups, mainly composed of a diverse pool of low abundance OTUs. Basin communities were very distinctive, with alpha and beta diversity patterns non-related to basin size or spatial distance respectively. Dissimilarity between basins was mainly characterised by turnover of OTUs. The strong microbial eukaryotic heterogeneity observed among the basins may be explained by a complex combination of deterministic factors (diverging environment in the basins), spatial constraints, and randomness including founder effects. Most interestingly, communities contain organisms that cannot coexist at the same time because of incompatible metabolic requirements, thus suggesting the existence of a pool of dormant organisms whose activity varies along with the changing environment. These organisms accumulate in the pools, which turns granitic rock into high biodiversity microbial islands whose conservation and study deserve further attention.",,,10.1007/s00248-019-01463-y

We examined temporal variation in the relative roles of environmental and spatial factors for diatom community composition among brackish-watered rock pools on the Baltic Sea coast over a 3-month period. We used a combination of direct ordination, variation partition, and Mantel tests to investigate the metacommunity patterns. The studied communities housed a mixture of freshwater, brackish, and marine species, with a decreasing share of salinity tolerant species along both temporal and spatial gradients. The community composition was explained by both environmental and spatial variables (especially conductivity and distance from the sea) in each month; the joint effect of these factors was consistently larger than the pure effects of either variable group. Community similarity was related to both environmental and spatial distance between the pools even when the other variable group was controlled for. The relative influence of environmental factors increased with time, accounting for the largest share of the variation in species composition and distance decay of similarity in July. Metacommunity organization in the studied rock pools was probably largely explained by a combination of species sorting and mass effect given the small spatial study scale. The found strong distance decay of community similarity indicates spatially highly heterogeneous diatom communities mainly driven by temporally varying conductivity gradient at the marine-freshwater transition zone.",2019,49,10.1007/s12526-019-01016-z

Sparsely-distributed freshwater systems in arid central Australia provide important refuges for mobile species and act as biotic reservoirs under adverse conditions. Some of these perennial systems are also evolutionary refugia that support relictual insects. Microbes play an important role in driving aquatic biogeochemical processes, but little is known about their composition and spatial patterns in and across these arid landscapes. Here we sought to assess the diversity and spatial distribution of aquatic Bacteria and Archaea in arid Australian waterbodies. We used 16s-rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to analyze the structure of microbial assemblages in biofilms and the water column from 8 waterbodies along a geographic axis across 2 drainage divisions. We used isotope hydrology to differentiate between groundwater-dominated waterbodies and those fed by surface water. We tested predictions and used metacommunity theory to explore spatial patterns between water column and biofilm microbiota, between perennial and temporary waterbodies, and between groundwater-fed and surface water-fed systems. We found greater similarity between assemblages of water column microbiota than those of the benthic biofilms. The spatial distributions of water column and biofilm assemblages were best explained by different metacommunity concepts. Distance decay matched the composition of the water column microbiota, whereas species sorting appeared to drive the composition of biofilm assemblages. The latter showed considerable within-site variability, changing with the type of benthic substrate present. Electrical conductivity and pH partly explained the composition of the water column and biofilm microbial assemblages, but only the water column microbiota was associated with the aquatic isotopic signatures.

Unraveling the relative importance of stochastic versus deterministic processes in shaping biogeographic patterns of fungal communities has long been a challenge in microbial ecology, owing to high biodiversity and difficulties in identifying fungal taxa. Using a unique anthropogenic system of geographically isolated paddy islands, we collected 198 soil samples with a spatially explicit design to examine how ecological processes shaped fungal biogeographic patterns. Fungal community structure showed scale-dependent distance-decay relationships. Stochastic processes (dispersal and drift) contributed more to community assembly than deterministic processes (selection) at the local scale, which was largely attributed to drift. In contrast, deterministic processes contributed more to community assembly than stochastic processes at the regional scale, with soil dissolved organic carbon being the most important measured factor. Collectively, scale dependence of fungal biogeographical patterns in paddy soils is influenced by differential contribution of deterministic and stochastic processes.

Therefore, we collected 39 soil samples from a riparian oasis zone (ROZ) to the circumjacent desert zone (CDZ) at the lower reaches of Heihe River to evaluate bacterial communities based on the 16S rRNA gene data. We found that the bacterial community composition differed between ROZ and CDZ habitats, with significantly higher relative abundance of the phyla Gemmatimonadetes and Acidobacteria in ROZ, whereas the abundance of the phyla Actinobacteria and Deinococcus-Thermus was greater in CDZ. The difference in the bacterial community was almost entirely generated by the species turnover rather than the nestedness among all samples. In addition, we found that bacterial alpha-diversity index showed no significant difference between ROZ and CDZ habitats. The distance-decay analysis showed that spatial distance, plant community, soil property, and plant functional trait were correlated with bacterial community variations. However, the variation partition analysis (VPA) revealed that both soil properties and plant community strongly explained the difference [such as soil water content (WC), soil silt content, and plant community structure] compared with plant functional traits in bacterial beta-diversity and species turnover. Based on a co-occurrence network analysis, we found that the bacterial network of ROZ, which had more negative correlations, higher average connectivity, shorter average path length, and smaller modularity, was more complex than the network of CDZ. This suggested that the bacterial community was more stable and less vulnerable to change in the ROZ habitat than in the CDZ habitat. Overall, our findings suggest that the heterogeneity of soil properties and plant community collectively affect the structure of the soil bacterial community in an arid inland river basin. However, the influence of plant functional traits on the variation of the bacterial community depends on soil properties and plant community.",2019,10,10.3389/fmicb.2019.02655

Compared with the coastal ecosystem, studies comparing diversity and community structure of intertidal planktonic and benthic microeukaryotes are limited. Therefore, the ecological processes mediating their assemblies remain poorly understood. Environmental rRNA from two size fractions (nano- and micro-sized) of plankton and from seasonally collected (spring and summer) benthos, together with water and sediment chemistry and concentrations of heavy metals, were used to explore diversity and community structure of microeukaryotes in intertidal zones of southeast Fujian Province, China. Benthic microeukaryotes harbored significantly higher alpha-diversity than those of the plankton, whereas no distinct patterns of organism size/seasonal distribution were observed for either community. Community compositions differed significantly between planktonic and benthic microeukaryotes, with the former presenting size-fractionated discrepancies and the latter showing seasonal variation. Community turnover between planktonic and benthic microeukaryotes was mainly driven by stramenopiles and alveolates. Distance-decay patterns were found in both communities, with the rate of community turnover being higher for planktonic than benthic microeukaryotes. Among the environmental factors measured, the concentration of Cd and the water content of sediment were closely associated with benthic community variations, whereas none of the factors measured was identified as being responsible for planktonic community variation. Phylogenetic null model analysis indicated that dispersal limitation was the most crucial ecological process mediating community assembly for both planktonic and benthic microeukaryotes in intertidal zones, with heterogeneous selection making a higher contribution to community variation of benthic than planktonic microeukaryotes. Stochastic processes, mainly dispersal limitation, were found to prevail in both communities.

Here, we investigated the temporal stability of bacterial and fungal communities in the soil and how their temporal variation varies between grasses and forb species. We established 30 outdoor mesocosms consisting of six plant monocultures and followed microbial communities for an entire year in these soils. We demonstrate that bacterial communities vary greatly over time and that turnover plays an important role in shaping microbial communities. We further show that bacterial communities rapidly shift from one state to another and that this is related to changes in the relative contribution of certain taxa rather than to extinction. Fungal soil communities are more stable over time, and a large part of the variation can be explained by plant species and by whether they are grasses or forbs. Our findings show that the soil bacterial community is shaped by time, while plant group and plant species-specific effects drive soil fungal communities. This has important implications for plant-soil research and highlights that temporal dynamics of soil communities cannot be ignored in studies on plant-soil feedback and microbial community composition and function. IMPORTANCE Our findings highlight how soil fungal and bacterial communities respond to time, season, and plant species identity. We found that succession shapes the soil bacterial community, while plant species and the type of plant species that grows in the soil drive the assembly of soil fungal communities. Future research on the effects of plants on soil microbes should take into consideration the relative roles of both time and plant growth on creating soil legacies that impact future plants growing in the soil. Understanding the temporal (in)stability of microbial communities in soils will be crucial for predicting soil microbial composition and functioning, especially as plant species compositions will shift with global climatic changes and land-use alterations. As fungal and bacterial communities respond to different environmental cues, our study also highlights that the selection of study organisms to answer specific ecological questions is not trivial and that the timing of sampling can greatly affect the conclusions made from these studies.",2019,10,10.1128/mBio.02635-19

However, revealing their biogeographical patterns remains challenging, as it is reflected in the rather limited available knowledge. In this study, two central patterns, the taxa-area and the distance-decay relationships, were tested for freshwater unicellular eukaryotes. Sampling was performed in 31 mountainous freshwater ecosystems in Thessaly (Greece). Sampling sites had different geohydromorphological characteristics (altitude, 124-704 m; depth, 0.3-1 m; surface area, 188-123 000 m(2); geographical distances, 0.03-48.4 km).

Five supergroups (Stramenopiles, Alveolata, Rhizaria, Archaeplastida and Opisthokonta) were found with the most abundant taxa being Stramenopiles and Alveolata. Aquatic unicellular eukaryotes showed statistically significant but weak DDR and TAR. This can be attributed to the large proportion of specialists (91.9% of operational taxonomic units according to Levins index).

With a new general eukaryotic primer set (18S, V1-V3 region), we performed FLX-454 sequencing of material from 21 waterworks sand filters varying in age (3-40 years) and geographical location on a 250 km east-west axis in Denmark, and put the data in context of their previously published prokaryotic communities. We find that filters vary highly in trophic complexity depending on age, from simple systems with bacteria and protozoa (3-6 years) to complex, mature systems with nematodes, rotifers and turbellarians as apex predators (40 years). Unlike the bacterial communities, the eukaryotic communities display a clear distance-decay relationship that predominates over environmental variations, indicating that the underlying aquifers feeding the filters harbor distinct eukaryotic communities with limited dispersal in between.

The distribution and biogeography of these ammonia oxidizers might be distinctive in high-elevation rivers, which are generally characterized by low temperature and low ammonium concentration but strong solar radiation; however, these characteristics have rarely been documented. This study explored the abundance, community, and activity of ammonia oxidizers in the overlying water of five rivers in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). Potential nitrification rates in these rivers ranged from 5.4 to 38.4 nmol N liter(-1) h(-1), and they were significantly correlated with ammonium concentration rather than temperature. Comammox were found in 25 of the total 28 samples, and they outnumbered AOA in three samples. Contrary to most studied low-elevation rivers, average AOB amoA gene abundance was significantly higher than that of AOA, and AOB/AOA ratios increased with decreasing water temperature. The Simpson index of the AOA community increased with elevation (P < 0.05), and AOA and AOB communities exhibited high dissimilarities with low-elevation rivers. Cold-adapted (Nitrosospira amoA cluster 1, 33.6%) and oligotrophic (Nitrosomonas amoA cluster 6a, 31.7%) groups accounted for large proportions in the AOB community. Suspended sediment concentration exerted significant effects on ammonia oxidizer abundance (r > 0.56), and owing to their elevational variations in source and concentration, suspended sediments facilitated distance-decay patterns for AOA and AOB community similarities. This study demonstrates distinctive biogeography and distribution patterns for ammonia oxidizers in high-elevation rivers of the QTP. Extensive research should be conducted to explore the role of these microbes in the nitrogen cycle of this zone. IMPORTANCE Ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB) as well as co-mammox contribute to ammonia oxidation, which plays significant roles in riverine nitrogen cycle and N2O production. Source regions of numerous rivers in the world lie in high-elevation zones, but the abundance, community, and activity of ammonia oxidizers in rivers in high-elevation regions have rarely been investigated. This study revealed distinctive distribution patterns and community structures for ammonia oxidizers in five high-elevation rivers of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and the individual and combined effects of low temperature, low nutrients, and strong solar radiation on ammonia oxidizers were elucidated. The findings of this study are helpful to broaden our knowledge on the biogeography and distribution pattern of ammonia oxidizers in river systems.

However, the relative importance of these processes in shaping riverine microeukaryotic biogeography is still poorly understood. Here, we compared the spatiotemporal and biogeographical patterns of microeukaryotic community using high-throughput sequencing of 18S rRNA gene and multivariate statistical analyses from a subtropical river during wet and dry seasons. Results Our results provide the first description of biogeographical patterns of microeukaryotic communities in the Tingjiang River, the largest river in the west of Fujian province, southeastern China. The results showed that microeukaryotes from both wet and dry seasons exhibited contrasting community compositions, which might be owing to planktonic microeukaryotes having seasonal succession patterns. Further, all components of the microeukaryotic communities (including total, dominant, always rare, and conditionally rare taxa) exhibited a significant distance-decay pattern in both seasons, and these communities had a stronger distance-decay relationship during the dry season, especially for the conditionally rare taxa. Although several variables had a significant influence on the microeukaryotic communities, the environmental and spatial factors showed minor roles in shaping the communities. Importantly, these microeukaryotic communities were strongly driven by stochastic processes, with 89.9%, 88.5%, and 89.6% of the community variation explained by neutral community model during wet, dry, and both seasons, respectively. The neutral community model also explained a large fraction of the community variation across different taxonomic groups and levels. Additionally, the microeukaryotic taxa, which were above and below the neutral prediction, were ecologically and taxonomically distinct groups, which might be interactively structured by deterministic and stochastic processes. Conclusions This study demonstrated that stochastic processes are sufficient in shaping substantial variation in river microeukaryotic metacommunity across different hydrographic regimes, thereby providing a better understanding of spatiotemporal patterns, processes, and mechanisms of microeukaryotic community in waters.",2019,7,10.1186/s40168-019-0749-8

Here, we characterize soil microbial beta-diversity at two spatial scales and at multiple phylogenetic grains to ask how archaeal, bacterial and fungal communities are shaped by abiotic processes and biotic interactions with plants. We characterized microbial and plant communities using DNA metabarcoding of soil samples distributed across and within eighteen plots along an elevation gradient in the French Alps. The recovered taxa were placed onto phylogenies to estimate microbial and plant beta-diversity at different phylogenetic grains (i.e. resolution). We then modeled microbial beta-diversities with respect to plant beta-diversities and environmental dissimilarities across plots (landscape scale) and with respect to plant beta-diversities and spatial distances within plots (plot scale). At the landscape scale, fungal and archaeal beta-diversities were mostly related to plant beta-diversity, while bacterial beta-diversities were mostly related to environmental dissimilarities. At the plot scale, we detected a modest covariation of bacterial and fungal beta-diversities with plant beta-diversity; as well as a distance-decay relationship that suggested the influence of ecological drift on microbial communities. In addition, the covariation between fungal and plant beta-diversity at the plot scale was highest at fine or intermediate phylogenetic grains hinting that biotic interactions between those clades depends on early-evolved traits. Altogether, we show how multiple ecological processes determine soil microbial community assembly at different spatial scales and how the strength of these processes change among microbial clades.

Soil microbes are the main driver of biogeochemical cycling in this forest ecosystem and have complex interactions with carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) components in the soil. Results We investigated the vertical soil microbial community structure in a primary Korean pine-broadleaved mixed forest in Changbai Mountain (from 699 to 1177 m) and analyzed the relationship between the microbial community and both C and N components in the soil. The results showed that the total phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) of soil microbes and Gram-negative bacteria (G-), Gram-positive bacteria (G), fungi (F), arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), and Actinomycetes varied significantly (p < 0.05) at different sites (elevations). The ratio of fungal PLFAs to bacterial PLFAs (F/B) was higher at site H1, and H2. The relationship between microbial community composition and geographic distance did not show a distance-decay pattern. The coefficients of variation for bacteria were maximum among different sites (elevations). Total soil organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), soil water content (W), and the ratio of breast-height basal area of coniferous trees to that of broad-leaved tree species (RBA) were the main contributors to the variation observed in each subgroup of microbial PLFAs. The structure equation model showed that TOC had a significant direct effect on bacterial biomass and an indirect effect upon bacterial and fungal biomass via soil readily oxidized organic carbon (ROC). No significant relationship was observed between soil N fraction and the biomass of fungi and bacteria. Conclusion The total PLFAs (tPLFA) and PLFAs of soil microbes, including G-, G, F, AMF, and Actinomycetes, were significantly affected by elevation. Bacteria were more sensitive to changes in elevation than other microbes. Environmental heterogeneity was the main factor affecting the geographical distribution pattern of microbial community structure. TOC, TN, W and RBA were the main driving factors for the change in soil microbial biomass.

Despite the ecological significance of bacterial communities, the integrated biogeography of planktonic and sedimentary bacterial communities in response to anthropogenic activities is not adequately understood. Here, we examined environmental parameters and the composition of planktonic and sedimentary bacteria in the Yulin River, a tributary of Three Gorges Reservoir, in response to changes in land use and dam construction. The results revealed that human-induced land use changes enhanced the nutrient concentrations in surface water and dam construction reduced the content of carbon and nitrogen in immediately downstream sediments. Intensified human-dominated land use showed a slight impact on sedimentary bacterial communities but largely reduced the diversity of planktonic bacterial communities. Moreover. human-induced land use changes increased the abundance of genes associated with denitrification, nitrification, and anammox in planktonic bacterial communities by 19.04%, 32.40% and 30.45%, respectively. In dam construction regions, the diversity and nutrient-related metabolic activity of sedimentary bacterial communities immediately downstream of the dam were decreased, whereas these changes were not observed in planktonic bacterial communities. Additionally, bacterial community composition was significantly related to nutrient concentrations variability and followed a distance-decay pattern. Furthermore, environmental effects explained more of the variation in planktonic bacterial community composition as compared with spatial effects did, whereas, sedimentary bacterial communities were more closely related to spatial effects.

Here we performed Illumina MiSeq high throughput sequencing of the fungal ITS1 region from 31 soils covering representative saline agricultural lands in northwest China. The results showed that Dothideomycetes, Eurotiomycetes and Sordariomycetes were the dominant taxonomic groups across all soil samples (>5% of all sequences), while saprotroph, pathotroph-saprotroph-symbiotroph and pathotroph were the main functional guilds across all soil samples. Interestingly, the fungal abundance and alpha diversity increased with increasing longitudinal gradient from 84 degrees 13 E to 89 degrees 11 E. Soil moisture, followed by salinity and total potassium, were the primary environmental drivers of the fungal community; these soil parameters were significantly (P < 0.05) correlated with longitude, and therefore potentially result in longitudinal fungal gradients. Furthermore, the fungal community assembly was mainly stochastic; fungal community exhibited distance-decay distribution patterns, which were mainly influenced by geographical distance.

However, few studies have attempted to interpret the microbial distance-decay pattern from the perspective of quantifying underlying processes. In this study, we examined the processes governing bacterial community assembly at multiple spatial scales in maize fields of Northeast China using Illumina MiSeq sequencing. Results showed that the processes governing spatial turnover in bacterial community composition shifted regularly with spatial scale, with homogenizing dispersal dominating at small spatial scales and variable selection dominating at larger scales, which in turn explained the distance-decay pattern that closer located sites tended to have higher community similarity. Together, homogenizing dispersal and dispersal limitation resulting from geographic factors governed about 33% of spatial turnover in bacterial community composition. Deterministic selection processes had the strongest influence, at 57%, with biotic factors and abiotic environmental filtering (mainly imposed by soil pH) respectively contributing about 37% and 63% of variation. Our results provided a novel and comprehensive way to explain the distance-decay pattern of soil microbiome via quantifying the assembly processes at multiple spatial scales, as well as the method to quantify the influence of abiotic, biotic, and geographic factors in shaping microbial community structure, thus enabling understanding of widely acknowledged microbial biogeographic patterns and microbial ecology.",2019,8,10.1002/mbo3.851

Zeta diversity provides a common currency and conceptual framework that links incidence-based metrics with multiple patterns of interest in biology, ecology, and biodiversity science. It quantifies the variation in species (or OTU) composition of multiple assemblages (or cases) in space or time, to capture the contribution of the full suite of narrow, intermediate, and wide-ranging species to biotic heterogeneity. Here we provide a conceptual framework for the application and interpretation of patterns of continuous change in compositional diversity using zeta diversity. This includes consideration of the survey design context, and the multiple ways in which zeta diversity decline and decay can be used to examine and test turnover in the identity of elements across space and time. We introduce the zeta ratio-based retention rate curve to quantify rates of compositional change. We illustrate these applications using 11 empirical data sets from a broad range of taxa, scales, and levels of biological organization-from DNA molecules and microbes to communities and interaction networks-including one of the original data sets used to express compositional change and distance decay in ecology. We show (1) how different sample selection schemes used during the calculation of compositional change are appropriate for different data types and questions, (2) how higher orders of zeta may in some cases better detect shifts and transitions, and (3) the relative roles of rare vs. common species in driving patterns of compositional change.

Here, we explore whether spatial scale-dependent patterns of beta-diversity vary between microbial functional groups and bacterial taxa (i.e., diazotrophic and bacterial communities) across local to regional scales (from metres to hundreds of kilometres). Location Eastern China. Time period October and November 2015. Major taxa studied Diazotrophic and bacterial communities. We use two complementary statistical tools to unveil biotic mechanisms (i.e., species association) underlying variation in beta-diversity of diazotrophic and bacterial communities. We examined distance-decay slopes of both communities at the local (1-113 m), meso- (3.4-39 km) and regional (103-668 km) scales. We used an environmentally constrained checkerboard score and topological features of association networks as indices of species association. We then calculated contributions of species association, abiotic factors and geographical distance to explain community beta-diversity. The scale-dependent distance-decay relationships were also examined in ubiquitous (high occupancy across samples) and endemic communities of diazotrophs and bacteria. Diazotrophs displayed steeper distance-decay slopes than bacteria, suggesting that the beta-diversity of diazotrophic communities was more variable. The distance-decay slopes were dependent on spatial scales in both communities, owing to different contributions of geographical distance, abiotic factors and species association at three spatial scales. Intriguingly, species association was greater and contributed more to community beta-diversity than other forces at the local scale, implying that species association could greatly alter community structures. Drivers of diazotrophic and bacterial community beta-diversity depended on spatial scales, resulting in different distance-decay patterns. Moreover, this was the first study to use two methods to demonstrate that species association played important, but as yet unrecognized, roles in driving spatial scale-dependent beta-diversity.

Here, we analyzed taxonomic distribution patterns, and unraveled community assembly processes underlying the core and random bacterioplankton and microeukaryotes from a subtropical river-reservoir system. These plankton domains were modelled using the spatial abundance distributions (SpADs) of the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) as a proxy for abundant and rare taxa delineation. Both bacterioplankton and microeukaryote plankton communities exhibited significant distance-decay relationships, and samples were grouped depending on reservoir or river habitats. The neutral community model showed that 35-45% of the plankton community variation could be explained by neutral processes. The phylogenetic null model revealed that dispersal limitation accounted for the largest percentage of pairwise comparisons (42-68%), followed by environmental selection (18-25%).

Spatial structure and distance-decay relationships were also similar for bacteria and fungi, with significant spatial structure detected at < 50 cm among root-but not soil-associated microbes. Recruitment of root microbes from the soil community appeared limited at this sampling and sequencing depth. Possible explanations for this include recruitment from low-abundance populations of soil microbes, active recruitment from neighbouring plants and/or vertical transmission of symbionts to new clones, suggesting varied methods of microbial community assembly for viviparous plants. Our results suggest that even at relatively small spatial scales, deterministic processes play a significant role in belowground microbial community structure and assembly.",2019,95,10.1093/femsec/fiz058

However, the underlying ecological mechanisms that maintain and regulate the spatial structuring of ectomycorrhizal fungal communities are both complex and remain poorly understood. Here, we use a gradient of mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) induced tree mortality across eleven stands in lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) forests of western Canada to investigate: (i) the degree to which spatial structure varies within this fungal group, and (ii) how these patterns may be driven by the relative importance of tree mortality from changes in understory plant diversity, productivity and fine root biomass following tree death. We found that the homogeneity of the ectomycorrhizal fungal community increased with increasing tree death, aboveground understory productivity and diversity. Whereas, the independent effect of fine root biomass, which declined along the same gradient of tree mortality, increased the heterogeneity of the ectomycorrhizal fungal community. Together, our results demonstrate that large-scale biotic disturbance homogenizes the spatial patterns of ectomycorrhizal fungal communities.",2019,7,10.7717/peerj.6895

Previous studies have revealed the dynamics of planktonic vibrios in relation to environmental forces, such as temperature and salinity. However, little is known about Vibrio ecology in benthic environments. Here, we elucidate the abundance, diversity, and spatial distribution of Vibrio spp. in sediments of the Chinese marginal seas, with a wide spatial range from north to south covering the Yellow Sea (YS), East China Sea (ECS), and South China Sea (SCS). Quantitative analysis showed that Vibrio spp. were most abundant in the SCS (similar to 9.04 x 10(5) copies/g) compared to the YS (similar to 1.00 x 10(5) copies/g) and ECS (similar to 8.86 x 10(5) copies/g). Vibrio community compositions derived from Illumina sequencing of Vibrio-specific 16S rRNA genes varied significantly between sampling areas, which was reflected by a strong distance-decay pattern. The spatial distribution of Vibrio was governed by a joint effect of spatial and environmental factors (especially temperature, salinity, and SiO32-), and their respective pure effects explained only a small fraction of the community variation. Moreover, we identified the most prominent operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that were partitioned in these sea areas. Whereas Vibrionaceae OTU20 and Photobacterium lipolyticum were prevalent in the YS, Vibrio gigantic and Photobacterium piscicola, and P. piscicola, Photobacterium lutimaris, and Photobacterium alginatilyticum were prevalent in the ECS and SCS, respectively. Our study demonstrated clear spatial heterogeneity of Vibrio spp. in sediments of the Chinese marginal seas, laying a foundation for fully understanding the marine Vibrio ecology and the ecological roles of the species. IMPORTANCE Vibrio is an important component of natural marine microbial populations in terms of pathogenicity and roles in carbon cycling. Compared to the marine pelagic environment, our knowledge of the diversity and distribution pattern of Vibrio spp. in sediment is limited. Here, we show higher Vibrio abundance in Chinese marginal seas than in other studied sediments. There was a clear spatial differentiation of Vibrio abundance and community composition in different sea areas. The benthic Vibrio community displayed a strong distance-decay pattern across a wide spatial range, which was formed under the combined effects of spatial and environmental factors. These results provide deep insights into the ecological dynamics of Vibrio and its environmental controls, facilitating a more comprehensive understanding of the marine Vibrio ecology.",2019,85,10.1128/AEM.03064-18

Microbial communities are normally composed of a few abundant and many rare taxa. Abundant and rare taxa play different ecological roles in kinds of environments, but how their diversity and composition patterns response to elevation gradients is still poorly elucidated. In this study, we investigated the elevational patterns of abundant and rare bacterial diversity and composition in a mountain stream from 712 to 3435 m at Gangrigabu Mountain on the Tibetan Plateau, China. Our results revealed abundant and rare bacteria had similar decreasing elevation trend of alpha diversity, and both of them showed a significant elevational distance-decay relationship. However, the turnover rate of the elevational distance-decay of rare bacteria was higher than that of abundant bacteria. The species-abundance distribution patterns of rare taxonomic composition were associated with the elevational gradient, while most of abundant bacterial clades did not display any relationships with elevation.

Paddy soils, collected from different long-term fertilization treatments across a wide geographic area in subtropical China, were used to evaluate the spatial variation of HS chemical composition. The 3 dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy combined with parallel factor analysis was used to evaluate the chemical composition of the soil extractable humic substance (EHS, including humic acid and fulvic acid). Analysis of distance-decay relationship (DDR) was introduced here to study the spatial variation of the chemical compositions of these EHSs. It was found that geographic location impose greater impact on the compositional variation of soil EHS than fertilization practice. Fertilization treatments including NPK (mineral N, P and K fertilizers) and NPKS (NPK fertilizers plus straw return) exhibited significant flattened DDR slopes as compared to CK (no fertilizers), which indicated fertilization (NPK and NPKS) decreased the variation of EHS chemical composition in paddy soils across geographic distance. A positive correlation was found between variations of soil bacterial community and EHS chemical composition, and fertilization (NPK and NPKS) enhanced their relationships. This work demonstrated that although the geographic location mainly dominated the spatial variation of the soil EHS chemical composition across geographic distance, the same long-term fertilization practice could gradually domesticate the paddy soils to display more similar EHS composition.",2019,186,10.1016/j.still.2018.10.014

Here, we conducted a comprehensive, continental-scale survey of soil archaeal communities in adjacent pairs of maize (dryland) and rice (wetland) fields in eastern China.ResultsWe revealed the consequential roles of environmental filtering in driving archaeal community assembly for both maize and rice fields. Rice fields, abundant with Euryarchaeota, had higher archaeal diversity and steeper distance-decay slopes than maize fields dominated by Thaumarchaeota. Dominant soil archaea showed distinct continental atlases and niche differentiation between dryland and wetland habitats, where they were associated with soil pH and mean annual temperature, respectively. After identifying their environmental preferences, we grouped the dominant archaeal taxa into different ecological clusters and determined the unique co-occurrence patterns within each cluster. Using this empirical dataset, we built a continental atlas of soil archaeal communities to provide reliable estimates of their spatial distributions in agricultural ecosystems.ConclusionsEnvironmental filtering plays a crucial role in driving the distinct continental atlases of dominant soil archaeal communities between dryland and wetland, with contrasting strategies of archaeal-driven nutrient cycling within these two agricultural ecosystems.

The diversity and distribution of non-photosynthetic cyanobacteria (NCY) across aquatic environments are currently unknown, including their ecology. Here, we report about composition and phylogenetic diversity of two clades of NCY in ten lakes of the European peri-Alpine region, over the past similar to 100 years. Using 16S rDNA sequences obtained from dated sediment cores, we found almost equal proportion of taxa assigned to Melainabacteria and the deepest-branching group Sericytochromatia (ML635J-21) (63 total detected taxa). The topology of our reconstructed phylogenies reflected evolutionary relationships expected from previous work, that is, a clear separation between the deepest branching Sericytochromatia, the Melainabacteria, and the photosynthetic cyanobacteria clades. While different lakes harbored distinct NCY communities, the diversity of NCY assemblages within and between lakes (alpha and beta diversity) did not significantly change over the last century. This is in contrast with what was previously reported for photosynthetic cyanobacteria. Unchanged community phylogenetic similarity over geographic distance indicated no dispersal limitation of NCY at the regional scale. Our results solicit studies linking in-lake environmental factors to the composition of these microorganisms communities, whose assembly appeared not to have been influenced by large-scale anthropogenic environmental changes. This is the first attempt to study the diversity and distribution of NCY taxa across temperate lakes. It provides a first step towards understanding their distribution and ecological function in pelagic aquatic habitats, where these organisms seem to be prevalent.",2019,9,10.3389/fmicb.2018.03344

Here we applied shotgun metagenomics sequencing to study microbial community dynamics and function in planktonic samples collected along an approximately 700 km river transect, including urban cities and rural settings in upstream waters, before and after the monsoon rainy season. Our results showed that 11%-32% of the microbes represented terrestrial, sewage and human inputs (allochthonous). Sewage inputs significantly contributed to the higher abundance, by 13-fold of human gut microbiome (HG) associated sequences and 2-fold of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the Ganges relative to other riverine ecosystems in Europe, North and South America. Metagenome-assembled genome sequences (MAGs) representing allochthonous populations were detectable and tractable across the river after 1-2 days of (downstream) transport (> 200 km apart). Only approximately 8% of these MAGs were abundant in U.S. freshwater ecosystems, revealing distinct biodiversity for the Ganges. Microbial communities in the rainy season exhibited increased alpha-diversity and spatial heterogeneity and showed significantly weaker distance-decay patterns compared with the dry season.

However, to be used effectively and reliably, more needs to be learned about the natural distribution patterns of microbial communities in soil. In this study we examine these patterns in detail, at local to regional scales (2 m-260 km), across an environmental gradient in three different soil types. Geographic location was found to be more important than soil type in determining the microbial community composition: communities from the same site but different soil types, although significantly different from each other, were still much more similar to each other than were communities from the same soil type but from different sites. At a local scale (25-1000m), distance-decay relationships were observed in all soil types: the farther apart two soil communities were located, even in the same soil type, the more they differed. At regional-scale distances (1-260 km), differences between communities did not increase with increased geographic distance between them, and the dominant factor determining the community profile was the physico-chemical environment, most notably annual precipitation (R-2 = 0.69), soil sodium (R-2 = 0.49) and soil ammonium (R-2 = 0.47) levels. We introduce a likelihood-ratio framework for quantitative evaluation of soil microbial DNA profile evidence in casework. In conclusion, these profiles, along with detailed knowledge of natural soil microbial biogeography, provide valuable forensic information on soil sample comparison and allow the determination of approximate source location on large (hundreds of km) spatial scales. Moreover, at small spatial scales it may enable pinpointing the source location of a sample to within at least 25 m, regardless of soil type and environmental conditions.",2019,38,10.1016/j.fsigen.2018.11.010

In this study, we investigated the spatial distribution and community assembly of fungi in the bulk soil and rhizosphere of soybean collected from 43 sites across China using high-throughput sequencing. The alpha diversity of the rhizosphere was lower than that of bulk soil. The fungal community structures of the two soil compartments were distinct. Fungal communities in the rhizosphere had a steeper distance-decay relationship slope between sampled sites than those in bulk soil, suggesting a greater influence of historical processes ( geographical separation) in the rhizosphere. The relative importance of dispersal limitation and environmental filtering for the fungal community composition differed between bulk soil and rhizosphere. Sloan neutral model analysis suggested that niche-based processes dominated the assemblage of fungal communities in the two soil compartments, while neutral processes had a weaker influence in the rhizosphere than in bulk soil. Additionally, we analyzed the structures of abundant and rare fungal sub-communities in each soil compartment. Rare sub-communities were more strongly influenced by dispersal limitation than abundant sub-communities.

The biogeography of rhizobia has been well investigated, but little is known about the spatial distribution and community assemblage of NRE. By using high-throughput sequencing, we compared biogeographic patterns of rhizobial and non-rhizobial subcommunities and investigated their bacterial co-occurrence patterns in nodules collected from 50 soybean fields across China. Dispersal probability was lower in NRE than in rhizobia, as revealed by a significant distance-decay relationship found in NRE, but not in rhizobia, in addition to a significant occupancy-abundance relationship in the entire community. Rhizobial and NRE subcommunities were significantly influenced by different environmental and spatial variables. Moreover, the rhizobial subcommunities were grouped into Ensifer- and Bradyrhizobium-dominated clusters that were significantly related to soil pH. The non-rhizobial subcommunities were grouped into Proteobacteria-and Firmicutes-dominated clusters that were more influenced by climatic than by edaphic factors. These results demonstrated that rhizobial and non-rhizobial subcommunities are characterized by distinct biogeographic patterns. Network analysis showed rhizobia and NRE as separately grouped and uncorrelated with each other, suggesting they did not share niche space in soybean nodules.

These holes are self-contained ecosystems that include abundant bacterial life within their sediment and liquid water, and have recently gained the attention of microbial ecologists looking to use cryoconite holes as natural microcosms to study microbial community assembly. Here, we explore the idea that cryoconite holes can be viewed as islands, in the same sense that an island in the ocean is an area of habitat surrounded by a barrier to entry. In the case of a classic oceanic island, the ocean is a barrier between islands, but in the case of cryoconite holes, the ocean is comprised of impermeable solid ice. We test two hypotheses, born out of island biogeographic theory, that can be readily applied to cryoconite hole bacteria. First, we ask to what extent the size of a cryoconite hole is related to the amount of bacterial diversity found within it. Second, we ask to what extent cryoconite holes exhibit distance decay of similarity, meaning that geographically close holes are expected to harbor similar bacterial communities, and distant holes are expected to harbor more different bacterial communities. To test the island size hypothesis, we measured the sizes of cryoconite holes on three glaciers in Antarcticas Taylor Valley and used DNA sequencing to measure diversity of bacterial communities within them. We found that for two of these glaciers, there is a strong relationship between hole size and bacterial phylogenetic diversity, supporting the idea that cryoconite holes on those glaciers are islands. The high biomass dispersing to the third glacier we measured could explain the lack of size-diversity relationship, remaining consistent with island biogeography. To test the distance decay of similarity hypothesis, we used DNA sequence data from several previous studies of cryoconite hole bacteria from across the world. Combined with our Taylor Valley data, those data showed that cryoconite holes have strong spatial structuring at scales of one to several hundred kilometers, also supporting the idea that these dirty holes on glaciers are really islands in the cryosphere.",2018,6,10.3389/fevo.2018.00180

However, many large rivers worldwide are suffering from dam regulation. Increasing attention has been paid to bacterioplankton communities since they are highly responsive to river alterations and may influence biogeochemical processes. Here, a comprehensive study was conducted in the highly regulated Lancang-Mekong River Basin to address the question of how bacterioplankton communities respond to cascade damming. The results showed that dam constructions increased nutrient concentrations and threatened water quality in cascade reservoirs. Bacterioplankton cell abundance was reduced by damming, and alpha-diversity was inhibited in cascade reservoirs. Fortunately, however, river ecosystems were resilient after the remarkable disturbance caused by damming. Moreover, bacterioplankton community composition was significantly altered by cascade dams, including a shift in the dominant phylum from r-strategists to k-strategists. Meanwhile, according to GeoChip analysis, the functional composition of bacterioplankton was less affected than taxonomic composition. In addition, geographic and environmental features both followed a distance-decay relationship with community and functional composition, but the local environment condition was the dominant driver in the Lancang River. Therefore, the impoundments of cascade dams had significant impacts on bacterioplankton communities and more attention should be paid to the potential ecological consequences of river regulation.",2018,27,10.1111/mec.14870

Spatial patterns have been detected in planktonic bacterial communities at distances <20 m, but little is known about the occurrence of similar variation for other microbial groups and changes in microbial meta-community assembly at different levels of a meta-community. To examine this variation, the biofilm of eight saline ponds were used to investigate processes shaping diversity within ponds (beta) and between ponds (delta). Bacterial and ciliate communities were assessed using ARISA and T-RFLP respectively, while diversity partitioning methods were used to examine the importance of taxonomic turnover and variation partitioning was used to distinguish spatial from environmental determinants. The results show that turnover is important for determining beta- and delta-diversity of biofilms. Spatial factors are important drivers of bacterial beta-diversity but were unimportant for ciliate beta-diversity. Environmental variation was a strong determinant of bacterial and ciliate delta-diversity, suggesting sorting processes are important for assembling pond communities. Determinants of diversity in bacteria are not universal for ciliates, suggesting higher functional redundancy of bacteria or the greater niche breadth of ciliates may be important in discriminating assembly processes between the two organisms.",2018,94,10.1093/femsec/fiy148

By using a high-throughput sequencing approach, we compared the BCs associated with Phormidium biofilms in several sampling sites of the Tarn River (France) and in eight New Zealand rivers. The structure of the BCs from both countries displayed spatial and temporal variations but were well conserved at the order level and 28% of the OTUs containing 90% of the reads were shared by these BCs. This suggests that micro-environmental conditions occurring within thick Phormidium biofilms strongly shape the associated BCs. A strong and significant distance-decay relationship (r(p) = 0.7; P = 0.001) was found in BCs from New Zealand rivers but the Bray-Curtis dissimilarities between French and New Zealand BCs are in the same order of magnitude of those found between New Zealand BCs.

Also, considerations are made about concept of species, discordances in the taxonomic concepts, and level of taxonomic resolution, and how these affect the biogeographic study of cyanobacteria. From a overview, it can be observed that both environmental and historical factors are important to structure cyanobacteria diversity across time and space. Moreover, different species may exhibit significant differences in their distribution patterns, from possibly cosmopolitan species to other endemic species. However, distribution patterns are closely dependent on the concept of species, besides the taxonomic resolution, spatial and environmental scales, and the biases of the molecular methodologies applied in the studies.

We found that abundant and rare bacterial taxa were distinctly different in diversity, despite the similar biogeographic patterns and strong distance-decay relationships, but the dispersal of rare bacterial taxa was more limited than that of abundant taxa. Furthermore, the environmental (selective processes) and spatial (neutral processes) factors seemed to govern the assembly and biogeography of abundant and rare bacterial subcommunities, although both factors explained only a small fraction of variation within the rare subcommunity. More importantly, variation partitioning (based on adjusted R-2 in redundancy analysis) showed that spatial factors exhibited a slightly greater influence on both abundant and rare subcommunities compared to environmental selection; however, the abundant subcommunity had a much stronger response to spatial factors (17.3% of pure variance was explained) than that shown by the rare bacteria (3.5%).

The coastal northern Zhejiang (in the East China Sea) is a typical subtropical marine ecosystemwithmultiple environmental gradients that has been extensively perturbed by anthropogenic activities. Thus, it is a valuable region to investigate the key drivers that shape microbial biogeography. We investigated microeukaryotic communities in surface waters from115 stations in this region using 18S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing. The microeukaryotic communities were mainly comprised of Dinoflagellata, Ciliophora, Protalveolata, Rhizaria, Stramenopiles and Cryptophyceae. The top abundant operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were highly specific for distinct habitat types, exhibiting significant environment-conditioned features; however, the cosmopolitan OTUs were not strongly correlated with the measured environmental variables. Total phosphorus and suspended particles were major environmental determinants of microeukaryotic alpha-diversity. Environmental variables, particularly temperature, salinity, pH and silicate concentration, were strongly associated with the microeukaryotic community composition. Overall, environmental and spatial factors explained 55.92% of community variation in total with 34.03% of the variation shared, suggesting that spatially structured environmental variations mainly conditioned the microeukaryotic biogeography in this region. Additionally, dispersal limitation, as indicated by the great pure spatial effect and distance-decay pattern, was another important factor. In summary, our results reveal that spatially structured environmental variation and dispersal limitation mainly conditioned the microeukaryotic biogeography. The results may provide useful distribution patterns of microeukaryotes to determine sources of microbes from marine ecosystems that may facilitate the utilization of coastal resources.

Here we analyzed the patterns of ARGs from 42 natural waterbodies (natural lakes and reservoirs) across China using high-throughput approaches. The major ARGs were multidrug genes and the main resistance mechanism was the efflux pump. Although the absolute abundance of ARGs (gene copies/L) in the south/central waterbodies was similar to the northern waterbodies, the normalized abundance of ARGs (ARGs/16S rRNA gene copy number) was higher in the south/central waterbodies than in the north (mainly because of the aminoglycoside and multidrug resistance genes). Human activities strongly correlated with the normalized abundance of ARGs. The composition of ARGs in the waterbodies of south/central China was different from that in the north, and ARGs showed a distance-decay relationship. Anthropogenic factors had the most significant effects on this spatial distribution of ARG composition, followed by the spatial, bacterial and physicochemical factors. These indicate that the ARGs exhibited biogeographical patterns and that multiple ecological mechanisms - such as environmental selection (human activities and local physicochemical parameters) and dispersal limitation - influence distribution of ARGs in these waters. In general, our results provide a valuable ecological insight to explain the large-scale dispersal patterns in ARGs, thereby having potential applications for both public health and environmental management.",2018,117,10.1016/j.envint.2018.05.023

To address this research gap, we examined the bacterial spatial turnover rate and the species networks in paired primary and secondary forest soils along a 3700-km north-south transect in eastern China using high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The spatial turnover rate of bacterial communities was higher in primary forests than in secondary, suggesting deforestation increased biotic homogenization at a large geographic scale. Multiple regression on matrices analysis revealed that both geographic distance and soil properties (especially soil pH and organic matter availability) strongly affected bacterial spatial turnover. Through the phylogenetic molecular ecological network approach, we demonstrate that the bacterial network of primary forests was more intricate than in secondary forests. This suggests that microbial species have greater niche-sharing and more interactions in primary forests as compared to secondary forests. On the other hand, the bacterial network in secondary forests was more modular, and the taxa tended to co-occur, with positive correlations accounting for 82% of all potential interactions. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that anthropogenic deforestation has clear effects on bacterial spatial turnover and network interactions, with potential for serious consequences such as microbial diversity loss in primary forests.",2018,123,10.1016/j.soilbio.2018.05.007
"Zhang, M; Chen, FZ; Shi, XL; Yang, Z; Kong, FX",Association between temporal and spatial beta diversity in phytoplankton,ECOGRAPHY,"The rates of temporal and spatial species turnover have been compared in different organisms and scales, revealing that both are not independent but, rather, associated. However, the knowledge is limited for the association between spatial turnover and temporal turnover. Here, we performed two investigations of the phytoplankton composition in the lakes of the Yangtze River catchment in China in the spring and summer of 2012, which covered regional spatial scale and two-season temporal scale. We analysed the association between temporal and spatial species turnover in phytoplankton. The results showed that 1) the two-season temporal turnover of phytoplankton varied based on the mean values and the coefficient of variance of environmental variables, and pH was the most important variable negatively affecting the temporal turnover; 2) the spatial beta diversity of phytoplankton in summer was higher than that in spring, and the distance decay pattern was significant in summer, but not in spring; 3) the variation in spatial turnover in spring and summer was attributed to the primary environmental variables (nitrogen, phosphorus and underwater available light) and broader-scale spatial variables; 4) the proportion of jointly explained variation of spatial Bray-Curtis dissimilarity by the environment and space increased from similar to 38% (spring) to similar to 55% (summer), which was mainly due to the variation in spatially structured environmental variables during the two-season temporal turnover, such as pH and ion concentrations; 5) the community compositions in summer were more similar between the lakes with similar two-season temporal turnover. These results indicate that the spatial turnover of phytoplankton composition in summer was partially predetermined by the variation in environmental variables and phytoplankton composition during the process of two-season temporal turnover, and highlight the understanding of temporal variations in spatial beta diversity as well as the underlying assembly mechanisms in phytoplankton.",2018,41,10.1111/ecog.03340

These investigations can reveal the process, infrastructure, and environmental factors that influence the microbial community, offering opportunities to re-think microbial management in drinking water systems. Often, these insights are missed or are unreliable in short-term studies, which are impacted by stochastic variabilities inherent to large full-scale systems. In this two-year study, we investigated the spatial and temporal dynamics of the microbial community in a large, full scale South African drinking water distribution system that uses three successive disinfection strategies (i.e. chlorination, chloramination and hypochlorination). Monthly bulk water samples were collected from the outlet of the treatment plant and from 17 points in the distribution system spanning nearly 150 km and the bacterial community composition was characterised by Illumina MiSeq sequencing of the V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene. Like previous studies, Alpha- and Betaproteobacteria dominated the drinking water bacterial communities, with an increase in Betaproteobacteria post-chloramination. In contrast with previous reports, the observed richness, diversity, and evenness of the bacterial communities were higher in the winter months as opposed to the summer months in this study. In addition to temperature effects, the seasonal variations were also likely to be influenced by changes in average water age in the distribution system and corresponding changes in disinfectant residual concentrations. Spatial dynamics of the bacterial communities indicated distance decay, with bacterial communities becoming increasingly dissimilar with increasing distance between sampling locations. These spatial effects dampened the temporal changes in the bulk water community and were the dominant factor when considering the entire distribution system. However, temporal variations were consistently stronger as compared to spatial changes at individual sampling locations and demonstrated seasonality. This study emphasises the need for long-term studies to comprehensively understand the temporal patterns that would otherwise be missed in short-term investigations. Furthermore, systematic long-term investigations are particularly critical towards determining the impact of changes in source water quality, environmental conditions, and process operations on the changes in microbial community composition in the drinking water distribution system.

By contrast, it is unknown whether microbes inhabiting the same ecosystems exhibit similar biogeographic patterns. To evaluate the biogeographies of tropical protists, we used metabarcoding data of species sampled in the soils of three lowland Neotropical rainforests. Taxa-area and distance-decay relationships for three of the dominant protist taxa and their subtaxa were estimated at both the OTU and phylogenetic levels, with presence-absence and abundance-based measures. These estimates were compared to null models. High local alpha and low regional beta diversity patterns were consistently found for both the parasitic Apicomplexa and the largely free-living Cercozoa and Ciliophora. Similar to animals and plants, the protists showed spatial structures between forests at the OTU and phylogenetic levels, and only at the phylogenetic level within forests. These results suggest that the biogeographies of macro- and micro-organismal eukaryotes in lowland Neotropical rainforests are partially structured by the same general processes. However, and unlike the animals and plants, the protist OTUs did not exhibit spatial structures within forests, which hinders our ability to estimate the local and regional diversity of protists in tropical forests.",2018,27,10.1111/mec.14731

This article contributes a new empirical study to the debate of death of distance by considering the effect of spatial autocorrelation in the estimation of distance decay effect with the incorporation of network autocorrelation in spatial econometric modeling. This work is based on a city level dataset from Chinas largest social networking site called Weibo. The findings are shown as following. First, the coefficient value of network autocorrelation term (0.007, significant at 0.01 level) suggests that the city-level online social links are spatially dependent. In other words, these social connections are not randomly distributed across space but tend to form spatial clusters where neighboring links are more similar. Second, controlling spatial autocorrelation in the data, a distance decay effect on the formation of online social links is unveiled with a much smaller scaling exponent of the distances (i.e., 0.276) as compared to those (e.g., 2.0, 1.8, 1.45, 1.06, 1.03, 0.4, and 0.5) in existing studies. This research provides a useful modeling framework to analyze the real world driving forces that characterize the patterns of social interactions in virtual space and thus advance our understanding in the connection of virtual and real spaces.",2018,70,10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2018.02.001

The distance-decay relationship, the change in species composition similarity between different communities over a geographic distance, is a commonly observed biogeographic pattern. To study biogeographic patterns and the corresponding driving forces, the bacterial distance-decay patterns along the horizontal and vertical dimensions in the South China Sea (SCS) were investigated through the sequencing of partial 16 S rRNA gene regions. Along the horizontal geographical distances (up to similar to 1000 km), no significant distance-decay pattern in community compositions was observed in any of the tested seawater layers. However, vertical depths (up to similar to 4 km) had strong effects on bacterial community variation, which was apparently governed by dispersal barriers due to limited water mass mixing. In addition, community variations in the vertical direction were strongly correlated with the prominent variation of environmental factors. Apparently, the changes in bacterial community compositions along vertical distances were much greater than those along horizontal distances. The results showed that the distance-decay relationship in bacterial communities at the medium spatial scale was associated with vertical depth rather than with horizontal distance, even though the horizontal distance is much larger than the vertical distance in the open SCS.",2018,8,10.1038/s41598-018-27191-w

Microbial biogeographic patterns almost always appear to be weaker than those reported for plant and animal taxa. It is as yet unclear why this is the case. Some argue that microbial diversity scales differently over space because microbial taxa are fundamentally different in their abundance, longevity and dispersal abilities. Others have argued that differences in scaling are an artifact of how we assess microbial biogeography, driven, for example, by differences in taxonomic resolution, spatial scale, sampling effort or community activity/dormancy. We tested these alternative explanations by comparing bacterial biogeographic patterns in soil to those of trees found in a forest in Gabon. Altering taxonomic resolution, excluding inactive individuals, or adjusting for differences in spatial scale were insufficient to change the rate of microbial taxonomic turnover. In contrast, we account for the differences in spatial turnover between these groups by equalizing sampling extent. Our results suggest that spatial scaling differences between microbial and plant diversity are likely not due to fundamental differences in biology, and that sampling extent should be taken into account when comparing the biogeographic patterns of microorganisms and larger organisms.",2018,12,10.1038/s41396-018-0103-3

To understand spatial distribution patterns of soil bacterial community along elevation, we analyzed the soil bacterial community diversity and composition along an elevational gradient of 699-1177 m in a primitive Korean pine forest in Changbai Mountain using the high-throughput sequencing. In total, 149,519 optimized sequences were obtained. Bacterial Shannon index increased along elevation from 699 m to 937 m and started to decrease at the elevation of 1,044 m, showing a humpback curve along elevation. Evenness (ACE index) and richness (Chao index) of the soil bacterial community both decreased with elevation (the highest values of 770 and 762 at 699 m and the lowest values of 548 and 539 at 1,177 m, respectively), all the indices are significantly different between elevations. Bacterial composition at phylum and genus levels had some differences between elevations, but the dominant bacterial populations were generally consistent. Beta-diversity analysis showed a distance-decay pattern of bacterial community similarity at different samples. Soil physical and chemical properties explained 70.78% of the variation in bacterial community structure (soil pH explained 19.95%), and elevational distance only explained 8.42%.

We analysed metacommunity structure and functional trait variation in 148 communities of desmids, freshwater green algae, distributed throughout Europe. We delineated biogeographic modules for both taxa and sites using bipartite network analysis given that the taxa of a module co-occurred more often than expected by chance in sites of the same module. The network analysis distinguished two main acidic and neutral habitats, reflecting environmental filtering, and within each habitat separated species pools with distinct geographic locations, representing a plausible influence of historical biogeography. The geographic differentiation was consistent with a hypothesis of glacial refugia on Atlantic coast. Distance decay in community composition in addition to environmental influence further suggested a role of dispersal limitation. Next, we quantified the variation in cell volume and surface-to-volume of taxa within and among communities, to examine morphological and physiological adaptations of desmids in varying environments. Communities from continental climate contained larger desmids. Conversely, we found a functional convergence of smaller, fast-growing, desmids in oceanic regions. Overall, our findings suggest that niche-based processes, dispersal limitation, and historical legacy together drive the distribution and structure of desmid communities.

Our research aimed to characterize the genes and organisms from two different WWTPs that discharge into Lake Michigan, as well as from surrounding lake sediments to determine the dispersal and fate of these factors with respect to distance from the effluent outfall. Shotgun metagenomics coupled to distance-decay analyses showed a higher abundance of genes identical to those in WWTP effluent genes in sediments closer to outfall sites than in sediments farther away, indicating their possible WWTP origin. We also found genes attributed to organisms, such as those belonging to Helicobacteraceae, Legionellaceae, Moraxellaceae, and Neisseriaceae, in effluent from both WWTPs and decreasing in abundance in lake sediments with increased distance from WWTPs. Moreover, our results showed that the WWTPs likely influence the ARG composition in lake sediments close to the effluent discharge. Many of these ARGs were located on MGEs in both the effluent and sediment samples, indicating a relatively broad propensity for horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Our approach allowed us to specifically link genes to organisms and their genetic context, providing insight into WWTP impacts on natural microbial communities. Overall, our results suggest a substantial influence of wastewater effluent on gene content and microbial community structure in the sediments of receiving water bodies. IMPORTANCE Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) release their effluent into aquatic environments. Although treated, effluent retains many genes and microorganisms that have the potential to influence the receiving water in ways that are poorly understood. Here, we tracked the genetic footprint, including genes specific to antibiotic resistance and mobile genetic elements and their associated organisms, from WWTPs to lake sediments. Our work is novel in that we used metagenomic data sets to comprehensively evaluate total gene content and the genetic and taxonomic context of specific genes in environmental samples putatively impacted by WWTP inputs. Based on two different WWTPs with different treatment processes, our findings point to an influence of WWTPs on the presence, abundance, and composition of these factors in the environment.",2018,84,10.1128/AEM.02168-17

Here, we investigated the fungal community in sediment samples from 10 lakes located in the HRYR using high-throughput sequencing. The results showed that the fungal community was dominated by Sordariomycetes, Leotiomycetes, Dothideomycetes, Pezizomycetes and Agaricomycetes. The results revealed that altitude, mean annual temperature, C/N ration, dissolve organic carbon and total nitrogen were the best predictors for shaping fungal community structure in these lakes. Significant spatial and environmental distance decay relationships in the fungal community were detected. The partial Mantel test indicated that the fungal community structure was significantly correlated with environmental distance but not with geographic distance.

To address this deficit, we collected eight samples to unveil the bacterial and archaeal community in the Kaidu river, located at the arid region of northwestern China (an average of 2,500 m a.s.l.). For the bacterial community, phylogenetically Betaproteobacteria prevailed, followed by Alphaproteobacteria and Actinobacteria; at the finer genus level, Limnohabitans and Variovorax were prominent. Along the river, the bacterial community showed a continuous succession. Specifically, their alpha- and beta-diversity gradually increased, suggesting a distance-decay pattern. Additionally, there was an ecological transition between the dominant and the rare sub-community along the river: the relative abundance of the dominant members gradually decreased as the rare members increased. We report that temperature and spatial distance were significantly related to the variation of bacterial community. Variance partitioning analysis showed that the environmental factors contributed more to the bacterial community than did the spatial distance. In the case of the archaeal community, the methanogenic groups, mainly Methanosaeta and Methanosarcina, were prominent within the Kaidu river. Unlike the continuous change in the patterns of the bacterial community, the archaeal community showed a constant pattern along the river. Our results showed that the archaeal community was independent of the environmental and spatial factors.

So the objectives of this study were to investigate the diversity and composition of these microbial communities which were enriched on the anodes of soil microbial fuel cells (SMFCs) and to elucidate the links between the microbial community compositions and their driving factors. We used Illumina HiSeq sequencing to determine the bacterial community structures which were enriched on the anodes of SMFCs. Variance partitioning analysis (VPA) was used to obtain the contribution of soil properties and geographical distance to the variations of bacterial communities. Active bacterial community on anodes of the closed circuit SMFCs differs significantly from the control open circuit SMFCs. Anodes of all the closed circuit SMFCs were characterized by the presence of high numbers of Nitrospira and Anaerolineae. Taxonomic similarities and phylogenetic similarities of bacterial communities from different paddy soil samples across North and South China were found to be significantly correlated with geographical distances. The relationship between the similarities and the geographic distance exhibited a distance-decay relationship.

Here, we investigated the community composition and geographical distributions of benthic microeukaryotes using high-throughput sequencing of the 18S rRNA gene and quantified the contributions of environmental factors and spatial separation on the distribution patterns of both rare and abundant taxa. We collected 36 intertidal samples at 12 sandy beaches from four regions that spanned distances from 0.001 to 12,000 km. We found 12,890 operational taxonomic units (OTUs; 97% sequence identity level) including members of all eukaryotic super-groups and several phyla of uncertain position. Arthropoda and Diatomeae dominated the sequence reads in abundance, but Ciliophora and Discoba were the most diverse groups across all samples. About one-third of the OTUs could not be definitively classified at a similarity level of 80%, supporting the view that a large number of rare and minute marine species may have escaped previous characterization. We found generally similar geographical patterns for abundant and rare microeukaryotic sub-communities, and both showed a significant distance-decay similarity trend. Variation partitioning showed that both rare and abundant sub-communities exhibited a slightly stronger response to environmental factors than spatial (distance) factors. However, the abundant sub-community was strongly correlated with variations in spatial, environmental and sediment grain size factors (66% of variance explained), but the rare assemblage was not (16%).

Our analyses indicated that protist communities were governed more strongly by species sorting relative to dispersal limitation than were bacterial communities; this pattern was consistent across the three-depth layers, albeit to different degrees. Furthermore, we detected that bacteria exhibited wider habitat niche breadths than protists, whereas, passive dispersal abilities were not appreciably different between them. Our findings support the size-plasticity hypothesis: smaller organisms (bacteria) are less environment filtered than larger organisms (protists), as smaller organisms are more likely to be plastic in metabolic abilities and have greater environmental tolerance.",2018,12,10.1038/ismej.2017.183

With the increasing shipping activities, the risk of oil spills remains high. Archaea are widely distributed in many environments. However, the distribution and the response of archaeal communities to oil contamination have rarely been investigated in brackish habitats. Hence, we conducted a survey to investigate the distribution, diversity, composition, and species interactions of indigenous archaeal communities at oil-contaminated sites along the coast of the Gulf of Finland (GoF) using high-throughput sequencing. Surface water and littoral sediment samples were collected at presumably oil-contaminated (oil distribution facilities) and clean sites along the coastline of the GoF in the winter 2015 and the summer 2016. Another three samples of open sea surface water were taken as offshore references. Of Archaea, Euryarchaeota dominated in the surface water and the littoral sediment of the coast of the GoF, followed by Crenarchaeota (including Thaumarchaeota, Thermoprotei, and Korarchaeota based on the Greengenes database used). The unclassified sequences accounted for 5.62% of the total archaeal sequences. Our study revealed a strong dependence of the archaeal community composition on environmental variables (e.g., salinity, pH, oil concentration, TOM, electrical conductivity, and total DNA concentration) in both littoral sediment and coastal water in the GoF. The composition of archaeal communities was season and ecosystem dependent. Archaea was highly diverse in the three ecosystems (littoral sediment, coastal water, and open sea water). Littoral sediment harbored the highest diversity of archaea. Oil was often detected in the littoral sediment but rarely detected in water at those presumably contaminated sites. Although the composition of archaeal community in the littoral sediment was sensitive to low-input oil contamination, the unchanged putative functional profiles and increased interconnectivity of the archaeal core species network plausibly revealed resilience and the potential for oil degradation. Halobacteriaceae and putative cytochrome P450 pathways were significantly enriched in the oil-contaminated littoral sediment.

Here, we examined the effects of species traits, spatial extent, latitude and ecosystem type on the nestedness and turnover components of beta diversity. Location: Global. Time period: 1968-2017. Major taxa studied: From bacteria to mammals. Methods: From the 99 studies that partition total beta diversity into its turnover and nestedness components, we assembled 269 and 259 data points for the pairwise and multiple site beta-diversity metrics, respectively. Our data covered a broad variation in species dispersal type, body size and trophic position. The data were from freshwater, marine and terrestrial realms, and encompassed geographical areas from the tropics to near polar regions. We used linear modelling as a meta-regression tool to analyse the data. Results: Pairwise turnover, multiple site turnover and total beta diversity all decreased significantly with latitude. In contrast, multiple site nestedness showed a positive relationship with latitude. Beta-diversity components did not generally differ among the realms. The turnover component and total beta diversity increased with spatial extent, whereas nestedness was scale invariant for pairwise metrics. Multiple site beta-diversity components did not vary with spatial extent. Surprisingly, passively dispersed organisms had lower turnover and total beta diversity than flying organisms. Body size showed a relatively weak relationship with beta diversity but had important interactions with trophic position, thus also affecting beta diversity via interactive effects. Producers had significantly higher average pairwise turnover and total beta diversity than carnivores. Main conclusions: The present results provide evidence that species turnover, being consistently the larger component of total beta diversity, and nestedness are related to the latitude of the study area and intrinsic organismal features. We showed that two beta-diversity components had generally opposing patterns with regard to latitude. We highlight that beta-diversity partition may give additional insights into the underlying causes of spatial variability in biotic communities compared with total beta diversity alone.",2018,27,10.1111/geb.12660

Collembola is one of the most abundant groups of soil fauna, which regulates microbial communities by consumption and dispersal. The spatial structure of associations between Collembola and soil microbes have been described in several studies, but temporal variation of these associations remains unclear. Using high throughput sequencing, we studied the fungal communities on Collembola (Entomobiya nivalis, Orchesella flavescens, Pogonognathellus longicornis) body surface, gut and their immediate habitat (topsoil samples) in four seasons across three years. The soil samples were characterized by fairly uniform relative abundance of saprotrophic and mycorrhizal fungi, whereas collembolans were associated mostly with saprotrophs. The structure of fungal communities from all substrate types exhibited comparable patterns of temporal distance decay of shnilarity. Unlike in soil, fungal richness and composition in Collembola body and gut samples exhibited seasonal and annual variation, with a significant interaction term, indicating low predictability. These results reflect spatial and temporal plasticity of the fungal communities associated with epigeic Collembola, indicating the high adaptability of collembolans to available conditions. We found that the Collembola associations with fungi (including diet) did not vary among the studied epigeic Collembola species. The detected high diversity of fungi associated with Collembola suggests that dispersal by arthropod vectors may represent a powerful alternative to aerial dispersal of fungal propagules.",2018,116,10.1016/j.soilbio.2017.10.021

Knowledge about the diversity and distribution patterns as well as drivers of microbial eukaryote (including ciliates) along the water column, particularly below the photic zone, is scarce. In this study, we investigated the diversity of pelagic ciliates, the main group of marine microeukaryotes, their vertical distribution from the surface to the abyssopelagic zone, as well as their horizontal distribution over a distance of 1,300 km in the Western Pacific Ocean, using high-throughput DNA and cDNA (complementary DNA) sequencing. No distance-decay relationship could be detected along the horizontal scale; instead, a distinct vertical distribution within the ciliate communities was revealed. The alpha diversity of the ciliate communities in the deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) and the 200 m layer turned out to be significantly higher compared with the other water layers. The ciliate communities in the 200 m water layer appeared to be more similar to those in deeper layers from 1,000 m to about 5,000 m than to the surface and DCM ciliate communities. Dominant species in the bathypelagic and abyssopelagic zone, particularly some parasites, were also detected in the 200 m layer, but were almost absent in the surface layer. The 200 m layer, therefore, seems to be an important species bank for deep ocean layers. Statistical analyses further revealed significant effects of temperature and chlorophyll a on the partitioning of ciliate diversity, indicating that environmental factors are a stronger force in shaping marine pelagic ciliate communities than the geographic distance.",2017,8,10.3389/fmicb.2017.02559

Roots of five Ericaceae together with one non-Ericaceae species were sampled at an experimental site and one common Ericaceae species was chosen for sampling along an elevation gradient. ENDF and putative ErMF communities were determined using the 454-sequencing approach. ENDF as well as putative ErMF communities were affected by interacting host plant. While the putative ErMF community was structured by host plants at the genus level, the ENDF community was affected by host plant subfamily level. Composition of ENDF as well as putative ErMF communities were affected by elevation. Non-Ericaceae plant species (Hypericum sp.) harbored similar communities of ENDF as well as putative ErMF as Ericaceae plants.

However, less is known about the role of soil depth in fungal community assemblages, especially under soil environments that are intensely cold, infertile and water deficient In Ngari drylands of the Asiatic Plateau, we studied fungal assemblages at two soil depths, using Illumina sequencing of the ITS2 region for fungal identification (0-15 cm as the surface soil and 15 -30 cm as the subsurface soil). Fungal diversity in the surface soil was much higher than that in the subsurface soil (P < 0.001), and communities differed significantly between the two layers (P = 0.001). Neither soil properties nor dispersal limitation could explain variation in the surface-soil fungal community. For the subsurface, by contrast, soil, climate and space explained 27% of variation in fungal community. Collectively, these results point to high dispersal rates and absence of edaphic effects in the surface-soil fungal community assemblage in Ngari drylands. It also suggests that for soil fungi with highly effective dispersal, regional distributions may fit with Bass-Beckings paradigm that Everything is everywhere. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The results showed that Agaricomycetes, Sordariomycetes, and Tremellomycetes are the dominant classes at all sampling sites. Operational taxonomic unit richness decreased with increasing altitude, and the fungal communities were clustered into three groups that corresponded to altitudes of, i.e., 1600, 2300, and above 2800 m. The evenness of fungi was not significantly correlated with altitude, whereas beta diversities were significantly correlated with altitude. The distance-based redundancy analysis and Mantel test indicated that the composition of fungal assemblages was mostly driven by altitude and temperature.

To compare the biogeographic patterns and its drivers of bacterial and fungal p-diversity, we collected 62 soil samples from a typical dryland region of northwest China. We assessed bacterial and fungal communities by sequencing bacterial 16S rRNA gene and fungal ITS data. Meanwhile, the beta-diversity was decomposed into two components: species replacement (species turnover) and nestedness to further explore the bacterial and fungal beta-diversity patterns and its causes. The results show that both bacterial and fungal beta-diversity were derived almost entirely from species turnover rather than from species nestedness. Distance-decay relationships confirmed that the geographic patterns of bacterial and fungal beta-diversity were significantly different. Environmental factors had the dominant influence on both the bacterial and fungal beta-diversity and species turnover, however, the role of geographic distance varied across bacterial and fungal communities. Furthermore, both bacterial and fungal nestedness did not significantly respond to the environmental and geographic distance. Our findings suggest that the different response of bacterial and fungal species turnover to dispersal limitation and other, unknown processes may result in different biogeographic patterns of bacterial and fungal beta-diversity in the drylands of northwest China. Together, we highlight that the drivers of beta-diversity patterns vary between bacterial and fungal communities, and microbial beta-diversity are driven by multiple factors in the drylands of northwest China.",2017,8,10.3389/fmicb.2017.02126

Few investigations have been reported on spatial variation of microbial community composition in response to fertilizations in agroecosystems at a large scale. To improve the related understandings, we have evaluated the taxonomic and phylogenetic diversities of bacterial taxa in response to three fertilization strategies in six paddy experiment sites spanning across subtropical China. We found the large-scale compositional variation of paddy bacterial community is shaped by both geographic location and environmental selection, and the former is the dominant factor. The slopes of distance-decay relationships (DDR) are flattened by fertilizations, NPK (mineral NPK fertilizers) and OM (mineral NPK fertilizers plus organic amendments) when compared to Control. A flattened DDR implies that bacterial community composition is greatly homogenized by fertilizations in paddies. It is also inferred that fertilization decreases sensitivity of bacterial community to geographic and environmental factors, which is speculated to be beneficial for agroecosystem stability and yield sustainability.

Little is known about the relative importance of the processes that drive planktonic and benthic microeukaryotic biogeography in subtropical offshore areas. This study compares the microeukaryotic community compositions (MCCs) from offshore waters (n = 12) and intertidal sediments (n = 12) around Xiamen Island, southern China, using high-throughput sequencing of 18S rDNA. This work further quantifies the relative contributions of spatial and environmental variables on the distribution of marine MCCs (including total, dominant, rare and conditionally rare taxa). Our results showed that planktonic and benthic MCCs were significantly different, and the benthic richness (6627 OTUs) was much higher than that for plankton (4044 OTUs) with the same sequencing effort. Further, we found that benthic MCCs exhibited a significant distance-decay relationship, whereas the planktonic communities did not. After removing two unique sites (N2 and N3), however, 72% variation in planktonic community was explained well by stochastic processes. More importantly, both the environmental and spatial factors played significant roles in influencing the biogeography of total and dominant planktonic and benthic microeukaryotic communities, although their relative effects on these community variations were different. However, a high proportion of unexplained variation in the rare taxa (78.1-97.4%) and conditionally rare taxa (49.0-81.0%) indicated that more complex mechanisms may influence the assembly of the rare subcommunity. These results demonstrate that patterns and processes in marine microeukaryotic community assembly differ among the different habitats (coastal water vs. intertidal sediment) and different communities (total, dominant, rare and conditionally rare microeukaryotes), and provide novel insight on the microeukaryotic biogeography and ecological mechanisms in coastal waters and intertidal sediments at local scale.",2017,8,10.3389/fmicb.2017.01912

As a complementary study, here, we investigated the fungal communities (mycobiome) in the same residences and occupants and identified factors that are important in shaping their diversity, composition, distribution, and dispersal patterns. Results: We observed that common skin and environmental fungal taxa dominated air, surface, and skin samples. Individual and touch frequency strongly and respectively shaped the fungal community structure on occupant skin and residential surfaces. Cross-domain analysis revealed positive correlations between bacterial and fungal community diversity and composition, especially for skin samples. SourceTracker prediction suggested that some fungi can be transferred bidirectionally between surfaces and skin sites, but bacteria showed a stronger dispersal potential. In addition, we detected a modest but significant association between indoor airborne bacterial composition and geographic distance on a city-wide scale, a pattern not observed for fungi. However, the distance-decay effects were more pronounced at shorter local scale for both communities, and airflow might play a prominent role in driving the spatial variation of the indoor airborne mycobiome. Conclusions: Our study suggests that occupants exert a weaker influence on surface fungal communities compared to bacterial communities, and local environmental factors, including air currents, appear to be stronger determinants of indoor airborne mycobiome than ventilation strategy, human occupancy, and room type.",2017,5,10.1186/s40168-017-0346-7

In this study, we investigated the biogeographic assemblies and ecological diversity patterns of rare and abundant bacteria in long-term oil-contaminated soils at intervals of 46-360km by performing high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA genes. The results clearly revealed distinct distribution patterns for rare and abundant bacteria in soil samples. Rare taxa were unevenly distributed; however, abundant taxa were ubiquitous across all samples. Both rare and abundant subcommunities showed significant distance-decay relationships, and their assemblies were driven by different factors. The rare subcommunity primarily exhibited a spatially structured distribution (i.e., stochastic processes), while edaphic factors (i.e., deterministic processes) largely contributed to the structure of the abundant subcommunity. A network analysis revealed closer relationships between abundant bacteria and their heightened influence on other co-occurrences in the community compared with rare species. In conclusion, rare microbial taxa may play potential roles in maintaining ecosystem diversity, although they do not appear to be central to microbial networks. Abundant microbes are vital for microbial co-occurrences in oil-contaminated soils, and high relative abundance and ubiquitous distribution suggest potential roles in the degradation of organic pollutants.",2017,26,10.1111/mec.14218

Here, we investigated bacterial distribution in bulk soil, loosely- and tightly-bound soils, from wheat fields distributed across 800,000 km(2) of the North China Plain. Bacterial community composition differed dramatically among bulk and rhizospheric soils, and bacterial diversity decreased with the root proximity. Soil pH correlated with bacterial community composition and diversity in three compartments. Bacterial community in tightly bound soil formed a hub-based network topology with higher transitivity and greater number of central nodes compared with loosely bound and bulk soils, potentially as a result of more direct ecological interactions between the members of the tightly bound soil compartment. Bulk and rhizospheric soils maintained similar compositional distance decay patterns (with equal decay rates), but distinct phylogenetic distance decay patterns (with steeper slope of tightly bound soil). Geographical distance described a relatively greater proportion of bacterial spatial distribution in tightly bound soil, compared with loosely bound soil and bulk soil. Deterministic processes dominated the assemblage of bacterial communities in all soil compartments, while phylogenetic clustering was weaker in tightly bound soil. Taken together, our results suggest distinct bacterial network structure and distribution patterns among bulk soil, loosely bound soil and tightly bound rhizospheric soil, which could possibly result in potential functional differentiation.

Urban sewage is potentially a major conduit for dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes into various environmental compartments. However, the diversity and abundance of such genes in wastewater are not well known. Methods: Here, seasonal and geographical distributions of antibiotic resistance genes and their host bacterial communities from Chinese urban sewage were characterized, using metagenomic analyses and 16S rRNA gene-based Illumina sequencing, respectively. Results: In total, 381 different resistance genes were detected, and these genes were extensively shared across China, with no geographical clustering. Seasonal variation in abundance of resistance genes was observed, with average concentrations of 3.27 x 10(11) and 1.79 x 10(12) copies/L in summer and winter, respectively. Bacterial communities did not exhibit geographical clusters, but did show a significant distance-decay relationship (P < 0.01). The core, shared resistome accounted for 57.7% of the total resistance genes, and was significantly associated with the core microbial community (P < 0.01). The core human gut microbiota was also strongly associated with the shared resistome, demonstrating the potential contribution of human gut microbiota to the dissemination of resistance elements via sewage disposal.

An empirical designation of rare and abundant taxa enlightens us on the structure of endophyte communities. We report multiple distance-decay patterns consistent with effects of dispersal limitation, largely driven by community changes in rare taxa, those taxonomic units that made up less than 0.31% of reads per sample on average. Distance-decay rates and community structure also depended on specific classes of fungi and were predominantly influenced by rare members of Dothideomycetes.

Elevation showed strong influence on bacterioplankton community composition (BCC) and that the dissimilarity of BCC increased with increasing differences in elevation. However, the elevational distance-decay rate of abundant bacterioplankton was higher than that of rare bacterioplankton. Abundant bacterioplankton were more sensitive to changes of environmental factors than rare bacterioplankton. We observed a marginal increase in alpha diversity, estimated as operational taxonomic unit richness and phylogenetic diversity, of overall bacterioplankton with increasing elevation. The alpha diversity of abundant bacterioplankton decreased monotonically with elevation; in contrast, the alpha diversity of rare bacterioplankton increased monotonically with elevation. Null model tests indicated that environmental filtering played a dominant role in overall bacterioplankton community assembly along the elevation gradient, while there was decreased contribution of environmental selection to rare bacterioplankton in smaller lakes at higher elevation.

Two major theories exist to date, to explain the community structure of organisms: (1) the dispersal (neutral) assembly theory which predicts that community similarity decreases with increasing geographic distance, independent of any environmental variables, and (2) the niche assembly theory which predicts that the communities compositions are more homogeneous among sites characterized by similar environmental conditions. Our study system offered a unique opportunity to investigate the relative role of environmental conditions and spatial factors in shaping community composition. We explored the bacterial community composition (BCC) of Nicotiana glauca floral nectar using the Illumina MiSeq technique at three spatial scales (plants, site, and region) and two taxonomic levels. Floral nectar samples were collected from 69 N. glauca plants at 11 different sites along a 200-km transect in Israel, along three biogeographic regions. A distance decay of BCC was found among all plants throughout Israel, but such pattern was not found among either sites or biogeographical regions. The BCC was also governed by environmental conditions in all examined scales (from the plant up to the biogeographical region). We also found that taxonomic resolution (89 and 97% sequence identity for clustering operational taxonomic units) affected the results of these BCC analyses. Hence, our study revealed that the BCC in N. glauca floral nectar is shaped by both the environmental conditions and the distance between plants, depending on the sampling scale under examination as well as by taxonomic resolution.",2017,74,10.1007/s00248-017-0935-9

In order to address this idea, we interrogated microbial community diversity at 49 sites in seven ponds in two seasons in the Lake MacLeod basin, a system fed by seawater flowing inland through underground karst. Environmental and spatial variation within ponds explain <9% of the community structure, while identity of the pond that samples were taken from explains 50% of community variation. That is, ponds each host distinct assemblages despite similarities in size, environment and position in the landscape, indicating a dominant role for local species sorting.

Here, we examined soil bacterial beta-diversity across different habitats in the drylands of northern China. We evaluated the relative importance of environmental factors versus geographic distance to a distance-decay relationship, which would be explained by the relative effect of basic ecological processes recognized as drivers of diversity patterns in macrobial theoretical models such as selection and dispersal. Although the similarity of bacterial communities significantly declined with increasing geographic distance, the distance-decay slope and the relative importance of factors driving distance-decay patterns varied across different habitats. A strong distance-decay relationship was observed in the alpine grassland, where the community similarity was influenced only by the environmental factors. In contrast, geographic distance was solely responsible for community similarity in the desert. Even the average compositional similarity among locations in the desert was distinctly lower compared with those in other habitats. We found no evidence that dispersal limitation strongly influenced the beta-diversity of bacterial communities in the desert grassland and typical grassland. Together, our results provide robust evidence of habitat specificity for microbial diversity patterns and their underlying drivers.

Given the biogeochemical significance of microorganisms, understanding the processes and mechanisms underlying their spatial distribution under changing environmental conditions is critical. To address this question, we examined how coastal bacterioplanlcton communities respond to increasing eutrophication levels created by anthropogenic perturbations. The results showed that the magnitude of changes in the bacterioplankton community compositions (BCCs) and the importance of deterministic processes that constrained bacterial assembly were closely associated with eutrophication levels. Moreover, increasing eutrophication significantly (P < 0.001) attenuated the distance decay rate, with a random spatial distribution of BCCs in the undisturbed location. In contrast, the complexity of interspecies interaction was enhanced under moderate eutrophication levels but declined under heavy eutrophication. Changes in the relative abundances of 27 bacterial families were significantly correlated with eutrophication levels. Notably, the pattern of enrichment or decrease for a given bacterial family was consistent with its known ecological functions. Our findings demonstrate that the magnitude of changes in BCCs and underlying determinism are dependent on eutrophication levels. However, the buffer capacity of bacterioplankton community is limited, with disrupted interspecies interaction occurring under heavy eutrophication. As such, bacterial assemblages are sensitive to changes in environmental conditions and could thus potentially serve as bio-indicators for increasing eutrophication. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Our results shoved that the soil bacterial community along the 451-km transect exhibited the distance-decay relationship, decreasing in community similarity with geographic distance. Obvious changes in the bacterial community structure occurred at an annual precipitation from 215 to 261 mm, which was close to the boundary between arid and semi-arid systems.

We estimated the distribution of ciliates in intertidal sediments with geographic distance ranging from 10 cm to 1,000 km, using high-throughput DNA sequencing. Higher community similarity, in particular that of rare ciliate taxa, occurred between replicates than between sites. Statistical analyses showed that the community dissimilarities of both abundant and moderately abundant ciliates had correlations with geographic distance at the scales of 50 m, 200 km and 1000 km, indicating a distance-decay relationship. No significant correlation was observed for rare taxa. The analysis of Bray-Curtis similarity showed a higher pairwise community similarity in abundant taxa than in moderately abundant taxa, and that in rare taxa was the lowest. Abundant taxa usually can disperse in a wider range than rare taxa, though their distribution is restricted by distance to some extent. Rare taxa are potentially more sensitive to changing environments, but no distance-decay relationship could be observed.

Common vent-specific organisms from both vent fields were the genera Arcobacter, Caminibacter and Sulfurimonas from the Epsilonproteobacteria and the SUP05 group from the Gammaproteobacteria. There were no major differences in microbial composition between SWIR and ESR for focused plume samples. However, within the ESR the diffuse flow and focused samples differed significantly in microbial community composition and relative abundance. For Epsilonproteobacteria, we found evidence of niche-specificity to hydrothermal vent environments. This taxon decreased in abundance by three orders of magnitude from the vent orifice to background water. Epsilonproteobacteria distribution followed a distance-decay relationship as vent-effluents mixed with the surrounding seawater. This study demonstrates strong habitat affinity of vent microorganisms on a metre scale with distinct environmental selection.",2017,4,10.1098/rsos.160829
"Liao, JQ; Cao, XF; Wang, J; Zhao, L; Sun, JH; Jiang, DL; Huang, Y","Similar community assembly mechanisms underlie similar biogeography of rare and abundant bacteria in lakes on Yungui Plateau, China",LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY,"The revolution of molecular techniques in the field of microbial ecology not only allows an in-depth exploration of abundant bacteria, but also confirms the existence of rare biosphere. However, the mechanisms underlying the assembly process of abundant and rare bacteria in plateau lakes are still poorly understood. In the present study, distribution of abundant and rare bacteria in 21 lakes on Yungui Plateau, China and the relative importance of deterministic and neutral factors to their biogeographic patterns were examined. Results surprisingly showed that similar biogeographic patterns of rare and abundant taxa were generally shaped via similar assembly mechanisms. For both bacterial groups, deterministic process strongly influenced the distribution, while neutral process was not at play. In addition, they both exhibited a weak distance-decay relationship. Nevertheless, environmental drivers of rare and abundant taxa and their importance were not exactly the same. Water physicochemical property was the most dominant driver shaping the biogeographic pattern of rare taxa, followed by lake morphology and watershed land-use, while for abundant taxa, watershed land-use was the most dominant driver and lake morphology did not play a significant role. This study suggested that rare bacteria in high-altitude aquatic ecosystems might experience equally low extinction risk and respond to environmental changes in a similar manner to abundant ones, but their ecological niches and functions were not identical. To fully understand the assembly mechanism of bacterial community, it is necessary to differentiate the community by traits of taxa.",2017,62,10.1002/lno.10455
"Marino, CM; Pawlik, JR; Lopez-Legentil, S; Erwin, PM",Latitudinal variation in the microbiome of the sponge Ircinia campana correlates with host haplotype but not anti-predatory chemical defense,MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES,"Many marine sponges host diverse symbiotic microbial communities that have been implicated in the production of secondary metabolites. These metabolites may defend the host sponge from potential predators. Variability in symbiont communities across the range of the host sponge could alter levels of chemical defense. To investigate the relationship between symbiont composition and chemical defense, the microbiomes and palatability of tissue samples from Ircinia campana were characterized from 5 sites along a latitudinal gradient spanning temperate (South Atlantic Bight, SAB) and tropical (Caribbean) regions. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and Illumina sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA genes revealed that I. campana from different locations contained significantly distinct microbiomes and exhibited a consistent relationship of lower symbiont similarity over greater geographic distance (i.e. distance-decay). However, crude organic extracts of all samples of I. campana were unpalatable to assay fish Thalassoma bifasciatum in laboratory assays, indicating no difference in chemical defense across locations. Distinct haplotypes of I. campana were detected in populations from the SAB and Caribbean, correlating with the observed patterns of latitudinal variation in microbial symbiont communities. Our findings indicate that I. campana is chemically defended from fish predators across the range of the species and that latitudinal variation occurs in the microbiome of I. campana, driven by a combination of host-specific factors and region-specific environmental filtering of symbiont communities.",2017,565,10.3354/meps12015
"Manrique, JM; Jones, LR","Are ocean currents to slow to counteract SAR11 evolution? A next-generation sequencing, phylogeographic analysis",MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION,"This work set out to shed light on the phylogeography of the SAR11 Glade of Alphaproteobacteria, which is probably the most abundant group of heterotrophic bacteria on Earth. In particular, we assessed the degree to which empirical evidence (environmental DNA sequences) supports the concept that SAR11 lineages evolve faster than they are dispersed thus generating vicariant distributions, as predicted by recent simulation efforts. We generated 16S rRNA gene sequences from surface seawater collected at the South West Atlantic Ocean and combined these data with previously published sequences from similar environments from elsewhere. Altogether, these data consisted in about 1e6 reads, from which we generated 355,306 high quality sequences of which 95,318 corresponded to SAR11. Quantitative phylogeographic analyses supported the existence of a spatially explicit distribution of SAR11 species and provided evidence in favor of the idea that dispersal limitations significantly contribute to SAR11 radiation throughout the worlds oceans. Likewise, pairwise phylogenetic distances between the communities studied here were significantly correlated with the genetic divergences predicted by a previously proposed neutral model. As discussed in the paper, these findings are compatible with the concept that the ocean surface constitutes a homogeneous environment for SAR11, in agreement with previous experimental data. We discuss the implications of this hypothesis in a global change scenario. This is the first study combining high throughput sequencing and phylogenic analysis to study bacterial phylogeography and reporting a distance decay pattern of phylogenetic distances for bacteria.

"Glassman, SI; Lubetkin, KC; Chung, JA; Bruns, TD",The theory of island biogeography applies to ectomycorrhizal fungi in subalpine tree islands at a fine scale,ECOSPHERE,"The theory of island biogeography, which predicts that species richness is a function of island size and distance from the mainland, is well tested with macro-fauna and flora. Yet, in many ways, microbes are more appropriate for testing this and other ecological theories due to their small size and short generation times that translate to an ease of replication. We used a natural experimental system of isolated host islands to test the generality of the theory of island biogeography. Specifically, we tested whether ectomycorrhizal fungal (EMF) richness increased with tree size and decreased with distance from forest in a subalpine basin in Yosemite National Park for two congeneric pine species, Pinus albicaulis and Pinus contorta. We determined EMF richness with next-generation sequencing, measured the size and age of each tree island (n = 40), and calculated geographic distances from each tree to the nearest forest edge. We found that EMF richness increased with island size (as measured by tree volume) and tree age for both pine species and decreased with distance from forest edge for P. albicaulis. Thus, we show the applicability of the theory to microbial symbionts in harsh, dry, and likely non-equilibrium systems. In addition, we found that despite the fact that our tree islands had a mean age of 65 yr, a pioneer community of EMF dominated. We interpret this as evidence that water stress interacts with succession to create a sustained period of early-stage fungi even in mature trees.",2017,8,10.1002/ecs2.1677

Here, quantitative polymerase chain reaction and 454 pyrosequencingwere combined to investigate the abundance and diversity of the activated sludge fungal communities from 18 full-scale municipal WWTPs in China. Phylogenetic taxonomy revealed that the members of the fungal communities were assigned to 7 phyla and 195 genera. Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were the most abundant phyla, dominated by Pluteus, Wickerhamiella, and Penicillium. Twenty-three fungal genera, accounting for 50.1 % of the total reads, were shared by 18 WWTPs and constituted a core fungal community. The fungal communities presented similar communitydiversitybut different community structures across the WWTPs. Significant distance decay relationships were observed for the dissimilarity in fungal community structure and altitudinal distance between WWTPs. Additionally, the community evenness increased from 0.25 to 0.7 as the altitude increased. Dissolved oxygen and the C/N ratio were determined to be the most dominant contributors to the variation in fungal community structure via redundancy analysis. The observed data demonstrated the diverse occurrence of fungal species and gave a marked view of fungal community characteristics based on the previously unexplored fungal communities in activated sludge WWTPs.",2017,24,10.1007/s11356-016-8137-4

Agriculture is a promising area for this exploration as soils harbor vast and diverse microbial communities. A better understanding of the drivers influencing microbial biogeographical patterns is necessary to properly exploit this resource. Here, we aimed to describe biogeographical patterns of bacterial communities across a broad spatial scale by sampling soils in 10 distinct farms (a total of 285 soil samples) located at the most important region for sugarcane production in Brazil. Bacterial communities were analyzed in terms of community structure and composition and further correlated with soil characteristics, agricultural practices and geographical distances. Distance decay patterns were found either at the bacterial community level (as determined by T-RFLP and sequencing analyses) and at the distribution of most bacterial phyla. Partial redundancy analysis revealed that soil characteristics (i.e., pH, granulometry, potassium and phosphorus contents) and agricultural practices (i.e., amendments of vinasse, charcoal and mechanical harvesting) explained the differential structuring of bacterial communities to a higher extend than did geographical distance. The co-occurrence/mutual-exclusion analysis suggested a role of biological connections in these assemblages, such as the co-occurrence of Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria, both negatively correlated with Actinobacteria. Our data constitute the broadest assessment of biogeographical patterns of bacterial communities across agricultural soils. Collectively, it indicates that these bacterial assemblages are suitable for management, what support the development of microbiome-based strategies in agricultural settings. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We predicted the biogeographic patterns of soil archaeal, bacterial, and fungal communities across 110 natural forest sites along a transect across four vegetation zones in Eastern China. The distance decay relationships demonstrated the distinct biogeographic patterns of archaeal, bacterial, and fungal communities. While historical processes mainly influenced bacterial community variations, spatially autocorrelated environmental variables mainly influenced the fungal community. Archaea did not display a distance decay pattern along the vegetation gradient. Bacterial community diversity and structure were correlated with the ratio of acid oxalate-soluble Fe to free Fe oxides (Feo/Fed ratio). Fungal community diversity and structure were influenced by dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and free aluminum (Ald), respectively. The role of these environmental variables was confirmed by the correlations between dominant operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and edaphic variables. However, most of the dominant OTUs were not correlated with the major driving variables for the entire communities. These results demonstrate that soil archaea, bacteria, and fungi have different biogeographic patterns and driving processes along this continental-scale natural vegetation gradient, implying different community assembly mechanisms and ecological functions for archaea, bacteria, and fungi in soil ecosystems. IMPORTANCE Understanding biogeographic patterns is a precursor to improving our knowledge of the function of microbiomes and to predicting ecosystem responses to environmental change. Using natural forest soil samples from 110 locations, this study is one of the largest attempts to comprehensively understand the different patterns of soil archaeal, bacterial, and fungal biogeography at the continental scale in eastern China. These patterns in natural forest sites could ascertain reliable soil microbial biogeographic patterns by eliminating anthropogenic influences. This information provides guidelines for monitoring the belowground ecosystems decline and restoration. Meanwhile, the deviations in the soil microbial communities from corresponding natural forest states indicate the extent of degradation of the soil ecosystem. Moreover, given the association between vegetation type and the microbial community, this information could be used to predict the long-term response of the underground ecosystem to the vegetation distribution caused by global climate change.",2017,2,10.1128/mSystems.00174-16

In the case of semi-arid plants, this interaction is strengthened by the harshness of the environment. We tested the hypothesis that dry season represents a constraint on the bacterial diversity of the rhizosphere from semi-arid plants. To accomplish this, we sampled two leguminous species at five locations during the dry and rainy seasons in the Caatinga biome and characterised bacterial community structures using qPCR and 16S rRNA sequencing. We found that the main differences between seasons were due to reduced phylogenetic diversity caused by dryness. Variation partitioning indicated that environmental characteristics significant impacts in beta-diversity. Additionally, distance decay relationship and taxa area relationship indicate a higher spatial turnover at the rainy season. During the dry season, decreased bacterial abundance is likely due to the selection of resistant or resilient microorganisms; with the return of the rain, the sensitive populations start to colonise the rhizosphere by a process that is strongly influenced by environmental characteristics. Thus, we propose that the reduction of PD and strong influence of environmental parameters on the assemblage of these communities make them prone to functional losses caused by climatic disturbances.",2017,73,10.1007/s00248-016-0835-4

Broad-leaved Korean pine mixed forest (Pinus koraiensis as an edificator) is the most representative zonal climax vegetation in the humid region of northeastern China; their vertical zonation is the most intact and representative on Changbai Mountain. In this study, we analyzed the composition and diversity of soil fungal communities in the Korean pine forest on Changbai Mountain at elevations ranging from 699 to 1177 m using Illumina High-throughput sequencing. We obtained a total 186,663 optimized sequences, with an average length of 268.81 bp. We found soil fungal diversity index was decreased with increasing elevation from 699 to 937 m and began to rise after reaching 1044 m; the richness and evenness indices were decreased with an increase in elevation. Soil fungal compositions at the phylum, class and genus levels varied significantly at different elevations, but with the same dominant fungi. Beta-diversity analysis indicated that the similarity of fungal communities decreased with an increased vertical distance between the sample plots, showing a distance-decay relationship. Variation partition analysis showed that geographic distance (mainly elevation gradient) only explained 20.53 % of the total variation of fungal community structure, while soil physicochemical factors explained 69.78 %.",2017,33,10.1007/s11274-016-2133-1
