"Hussain, AN; Al-Jubori, WKS; Kadom, HF","Hybrid Design of Optimal Capacitor Placement and Reconfiguration for Performance Improvement in a Radial Distribution System","JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING","Distribution System Reconfiguration (DSR) and Optimal Capacitor Placement (OCP) are the most alternative techniques for increasing the power system generation and covering the growth of power demands. These techniques reduce the Radial Distribution System (RDS) losses and enhance the voltage profile. Combining both techniques gives better performance than using the individual technique. In this paper, two operation modes were implemented. First, the individual mode of OCP is applied. Second, the dual mode of DSR after OCP process is applied. Multiobjective functions with considering the weighting factors are used for minimizing real losses, improving voltage profile, and increasing saving cost. The optimal selections of open switches, location, and size of capacitors in the individual and dual design for RDS are achieved using four different optimization algorithms. These algorithms are Modified Biogeography-Based Optimization (MBBO) algorithm, Cuckoo Search (CS) algorithm, Modified Imperialist Competitive (MIC) algorithm, and Modified Bacterial Foraging-Based Optimization (MBFBO) algorithm. These algorithms are applied for two standard networks (IEEE 33- and IEEE 69-bus). Comparisons among the proposed algorithms are done, and the results demonstrated that the MBBO algorithm is the most strong and fast algorithm to attain the optimum solution. In addition, comparisons with literature works are done to validate the effectiveness of proposed algorithms.","2019","2019","10.1155/2019/1696347","me","NO"

The biogeographic distribution of archaeal community in mangroves remains poorly known. In this study, six mangroves at different geographic locations in China were selected. Mangrove archaeal community was found to considerably change with geographic location, which might be driven by a variety of environmental variables (etc., pH and carbon and nitrogen contents). Archaeal communities were primarily comprised of Thaumarchaeota (54.7-85.2%) and Euryarchaeota (11.8-43.9%). This work could provide some new insights towards the distribution of archaeal community in mangrove ecosystem.","2019","231","10.1016/j.ecss.2019.106414","me","YES"
"Nguyen, CH; Beattie, GAC; Haigh, AM; Astuti, IP; Mabberley, DJ; Weston, PH; Holford, P","Molecular differentiation of the Murraya paniculata Complex (Rutaceae: Aurantioideae: Aurantieae)","BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY","Background: Orange jasmine has a complex nomenclatural history and is now known as Murraya paniculata (L.) Jack. Our interest in this common ornamental stemmed from the need to resolve its identity and the identities of closely related taxa as hosts of the pathogen Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus and its vector Diaphorina citri. Understanding these microbe-vector-plant relationships has been hampered by taxonomic confusion surrounding Murraya at both the generic and specific levels. Results: To resolve the taxonomic uncertainty, six regions of the maternally-inherited chloroplastal genome and part of the nuclear-encoded ITS region were amplified from 85 accessions of Murraya and Merrillia using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Clustering used maximum parsimony (MP), maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference (BI). Chronograms were produced for molecular dating, and to test the monophyly of Murraya rigorously, using selected accessions of Murraya and 26 accessions of the Rutaceae and Simarubaceae. Sequence data from the ITS and chloroplastal regions suggest that Murraya paniculata (sensu (Swingle WT and Reece CR, The Citrus Industry, p. 190-430, 1967)) can be separated into four distinct but morphologically somewhat cryptic taxa: Murraya paniculata (sensu (Mabberley DJ, Taxon 65:366-371, 2016)), M. elongata, M. sumatrana and M. lucida. In addition, Murraya omphalocarpa was identified as a putative hybrid of M. paniculata and M. lucida with two geographically isolated nothovarieties representing reciprocal crosses. Murraya is monophyletic, and molecular dating suggests that it diverged from Merrillia during the Miocene (23-5 Ma) with this Murraya group speciating and dispersing during the Middle Miocene onwards. Conclusions: The accessions from Asia and Australasia used in this study grouped into biogeographical regions that match herbarium specimen records for the taxa that suggest natural allopatric distributions with limited overlap and hybridity. Murraya paniculata has been distributed around the world as an ornamental plant. The division of the Murraya paniculata complex into four species with a rare hybrid also confirms morphological studies.","2019","19","10.1186/s12862-019-1555-4","me","NO"
"Chung, NC; Miasojedow, B; Startek, M; Gambin, A","Jaccard/Tanimoto similarity test and estimation methods for biological presence-absence data","BMC BIOINFORMATICS","Background: A survey of presences and absences of specific species across multiple biogeographic units (or bioregions) are used in a broad area of biological studies from ecology to microbiology. Using binary presence-absence data, we evaluate species co-occurrences that help elucidate relationships among organisms and environments. To summarize similarity between occurrences of species, we routinely use the Jaccard/Tanimoto coefficient, which is the ratio of their intersection to their union. It is natural, then, to identify statistically significant Jaccard/Tanimoto coefficients, which suggest non-random co-occurrences of species. However, statistical hypothesis testing using this similarity coefficient has been seldom used or studied. Results: We introduce a hypothesis test for similarity for biological presence-absence data, using the Jaccard/Tanimoto coefficient. Several key improvements are presented including unbiased estimation of expectation and centered Jaccard/Tanimoto coefficients, that account for occurrence probabilities. The exact and asymptotic solutions are derived. To overcome a computational burden due to high-dimensionality, we propose the bootstrap and measurement concentration algorithms to efficiently estimate statistical significance of binary similarity. Comprehensive simulation studies demonstrate that our proposed methods produce accurate p-values and false discovery rates. The proposed estimation methods are orders of magnitude faster than the exact solution, particularly with an increasing dimensionality. We showcase their applications in evaluating co-occurrences of bird species in 28 islands of Vanuatu and fish species in 3347 freshwater habitats in France. The proposed methods are implemented in an open source R package called jaccard (https://cran.r-project.org/package=jaccard). Conclusion: We introduce a suite of statistical methods for the Jaccard/Tanimoto similarity coefficient for binary data, that enable straightforward incorporation of probabilistic measures in analysis for species co-occurrences. Due to their generality, the proposed methods and implementations are applicable to a wide range of binary data arising from genomics, biochemistry, and other areas of science.","2019","20","10.1186/s12859-019-3118-5","me","NO"

However, information regarding the degree of overlap and partitions of microbial communities across different habitats in grasslands is limited. This study investigated the microbial communities in three distinct habitats from Xilingol steppe grassland, i.e. animal excrement, phyllosphere, and soil samples, by Illumina MiSeq sequencing. All microbial community structures, i.e. for bacteria, archaea, and fungi, were significantly distinguished according to habitat. A high number of unique microorganisms but few coexisting microorganisms were detected, suggesting that the structure of microbial communities was mainly regulated by species selection and niche differentiation. However, the sequences of those limited coexisting microorganisms among the three different habitats accounted for over 60% of the total sequences, indicating their ability to adapt to variable environments. In addition, the biotic interactions among microorganisms based on a co-occurrence network analysis highlighted the importance of Microvirga, Blastococcus, RB41, Nitrospira, and four norank members of bacteria in connecting the different microbiomes. Collectively, the microbial communities in the Xilingol steppe grassland presented strong habitat preferences with a certain degree of dispersal and colonization potential to new habitats along the animal excrement-phyllosphere-soil gradient. This study provides the first detailed comparison of microbial communities in different habitats in a single grassland, and offers new insights into the biogeographic patterns of the microbial assemblages in grasslands.","2019","9","10.1038/s41598-019-55940-y","me","YES"

Here, we tested how community structure and species interactions among diverse groups of soil microbes (bacteria, fungi, non-fungal eukaryotes) change across a fundamental ecological gradient, succession. Our study system is a high-elevation alpine ecosystem that exhibits variability in successional stage due to topography and harsh environmental conditions. We used hierarchical Bayesian joint distribution modeling to remove the influence of environmental covariates on species distributions and generated interaction networks using the residual species-to-species variance-covariance matrix. We hypothesized that as ecological succession proceeds, diversity will increase, species composition will change, and soil microbial networks will become more complex. As expected, we found that diversity of most taxonomic groups increased over succession, and species composition changed considerably. Interestingly, and contrary to our hypothesis, interaction networks became less complex over succession (fewer interactions per taxon). Interactions between photosynthetic microbes and any other organism became less frequent over the gradient, whereas interactions between plants or soil microfauna and any other organism were more abundant in late succession. Results demonstrate that patterns in diversity and composition do not necessarily relate to patterns in network complexity and suggest that network analyses provide new insight into the ecology of highly diverse, microscopic communities.","2019","10","10.3389/fmicb.2019.02887","me","NO"

However, it is still unclear how and to what extent bacterioplankton communities respond to the two factors, despite the functional importance of bacterioplankton in biogeochemical cycles. In this study, significant organic pollution index (OPI) and offshore distance gradients, as respective proxies of disturbance intensity and disturbance frequency, were detected in a regional scale across the East China Sea. A multiple regression on matrices (MRM) revealed that the biogeography of bacterioplankton community depended on spatial scale, which was governed by local characters. Bacterioplankton community compositions (BCCs) were primarily governed by the conjointly direct (-0.28) and indirect (-0.48) effects of OPI, while offshore distance contributed a large indirectly effect (0.52). A SEGMENTED analysis depicted non-linear responses of BCCs to increasing disturbance intensity and disturbance frequency, as evidenced by significant tipping points. This was also true for the dominant bacterial phyla. Notably, we screened 30 OPI-discriminatory taxa that could quantitatively diagnose coastal OPI levels, with an overall 79.3% accuracy. Collectively, the buffer capacity of bacterioplankton communities to increasing disturbance intensity and disturbance frequency is limited, of which the significant tipping points afford a warning line for coastal management. In addition, coastal pollution level can be accurately diagnosed by a few OPI-discriminatory taxa. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we characterize the gut microbiome in Darwins finches, comparing nine species that occupy diverse ecological niches on Santa Cruz island. The finch phylogeny showed moderate congruence with the microbiome, which was comprised mostly of the bacterial phyla Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria. Diet, as measured with stable isotope values and foraging observations, also correlated with microbiome differentiation. Additionally, each gut microbial community could easily be classified by the habitat of origin independent of host species. Altogether, these findings are consistent with a model of microbiome assembly in which environmental filtering via diet and habitat are primary determinants of the bacterial taxa present with lesser influence from the evolutionary history between finch species.","2019","9","10.1038/s41598-019-54869-6","me","YES"

In this study, we investigated the relationships between the composition of the soil bacterial, acidobacterial, and fungal communities and the transformation of wetlands by human activities in the Sanjiang Plain. Soil microbial communities were assessed in wetland soils collected from pristine marsh, neighboring cropland (wetland turned into arable land), and land that had been reforested with Larix gmelinii. The alpha-diversities of bacteria, Acidobacteria, and fungi were affected by land-use change and were highest in the arable land and lowest in the wetland soils. The soil microbial community structures were also altered with changing land-use. Canonical correlation analyses showed that beta-diversity was significantly affected by soil pH, available phosphorus, soil nitrogen, and total organic carbon. Overall, our results showed that the agricultural cultivation of wetlands changes the available soil carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus pools, thereby influencing the bacterial, acidobacterial, and fungal diversity and community structure. Once the soil microbial community has been altered by human activity, it might be difficult to restore it to its original state. These findings highlight the importance of effectively maintaining the diversity of soil bacterial, Acidobacterial, and fungal communities despite land use change in order to sustain a microbial community diversity and ecosystem function.","2019","9","10.1038/s41598-019-55063-4","me","YES"
"Zheng, Y; Gong, X","Niche differentiation rather than biogeography shapes the diversity and composition of microbiome of Cycas panzhihuaensis","MICROBIOME","Background Given their adaptation to nutrient-poor and drought environments, cycads are vital models for plant-microbiome interaction research because they are likely to host an important reservoir of beneficial microbes that may support cycad survival. However, a comprehensive understanding of the diversity and community composition of microbiome associated with different plant compartments as well as bulk soils of cycad species remains elusive. Method An extensive investigation of species diversity and community composition of bacterial and fungal microbiome in roots, seeds, unfertilized seeds, ovules, pollens, and soils of Cycas panzhihuaensis L. Zhou & S. Y. Yang has been conducted by high-through sequencing technology. Moreover, principal component analysis (PCA), hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), and heatmap analysis were applied to test the niche-specific effect and biogeography factor among different sample types of this cycad species. Results Highly diverse microbiota and significant variation of community structure were found among different compartments of C. panzhihuaensis. Soils exhibited a remarkable differentiation of bacterial community composition compared to the other five plant organs as revealed by PCA, HCA, and heatmap analyses. Different compartments possessed unique core microbial taxa with Pseudomonadaceae and Nectriaceae shared among them. According to the indicator species analysis, there was almost no differentiation of dominant microbiomes with regard to the geography of the host cycad. Two main transmission models existed in the C. panzhihuaensis. Conclusions Each sample type represented a unique niche and hosted a niche-specific core microbial taxa. Contrary to previous surveys, biogeography hardly exerted impact on microbial community variation in this study. The majority of the cycad-associated microbes were horizontally derived from soils and/or air environments with the rest vertically inherited from maternal plants via seeds. This study offers a robust knowledge of plant-microbiome interaction across various plant compartments and soils and lends guidelines to the investigation of adaptation mechanism of cycads in arid and nutrient-poor environments as well as their evolutionary conservation.","2019","7","10.1186/s40168-019-0770-y","me","YES"

However, little is known about the relative importance of the different ecological processes underlying the assembly of communities of sand microbiota. Here, we employed 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing to investigate the sand microbiota of two coastal beaches, in southern China. The results showed that sand microbial assemblages at intertidal and supratidal zones exhibited contrasting compositions that can be attributed to environmental filtering by electric conductivity. A consistent pattern of habitat generalists and specialists of sand microbiota was observed among different beach zones. Null and neutral model analyses indicated that the environmental filtering was mainly responsible for supratidal microbial communities, while the neutral processes could partially influence the assembly of intertidal communities. Moreover, environmental filtering was found to shape the habitat specialists, while random dispersal played a major role in shaping generalists. The neutral model analysis revealed that the habitat generalists exceeding the neutral prediction harbored a relatively higher proportion of microbial taxa than the specialist counterparts. An opposite pattern was observed for taxa falling below the neutral prediction. Collectively, these findings offer a novel insight into the assembly mechanisms of coastal sand microbiota.","2019","7","10.3390/microorganisms7120598","me","YES"

Result The dominant taxa in terms of abundance were found to be, Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, Gemmatimonadetes, Chloroflexi, and Proteobacteria. Bacterial communities were dominantly affected by soil pH, whereas soil organic carbon did not have a significant influence on bacterial communities. Soil pH was significantly positively correlated with bacterial operational taxonomic unit abundance and soil bacterial alpha-diversity (P<0.05) spatially rather than with soil nutrients. Bacterial functions were estimated using FAPROTAX, and the relative abundance of anaerobic and aerobic chemoheterotrophs, and nitrifying bacteria was 27.66%, 26.14%, and 6.87%, respectively, of the total bacterial community.

"Neal, AL; Glendining, MJ","Calcium exerts a strong influence upon phosphohydrolase gene abundance and phylogenetic diversity in soil","SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY","The mechanisms by which microbial communities maintain functions within the context of changing environments are key to a wide variety of environmental processes. In soil, these mechanisms support fertility. Genes associated with hydrolysis of organic phosphoesters represent an interesting set of genes with which to study maintenance of function in microbiomes. Here, we shown that the richness of ecotypes for each gene varies considerably in response to application of manure and various inorganic fertilizer combinations. We show, at unprecedented phylogenetic resolution, that phylogenetic diversity of phosphohydrolase genes are more responsive to soil management and edaphic factors than the taxonomic biomarker 16S rRNA gene. Available phosphorus - assessed by measuring Olsen-P - exerted some influence on alkaline phosphatase distribution: however, consistent and significant differences were observed in gene abundance between treatments that were inconsistent with bioavailable orthophosphate being the dominant factor determining gene abundance. Instead, we observed gene niche separation which was most strongly associated with soil exchangeable calcium. Our study suggests that the bioavailability of enzyme cofactors (exchangeable calcium in the case of phoD, phoX and beta PPhy studied here) influence the abundance of genes in soil microbial communities; in the absence of cofactors, genes coding for alternative enzyme families that do not require the limiting cofactor (for example, non-specific acid phosphatases which require vanadate) become more abundant.","2019","139","10.1016/j.soilbio.2019.107613","me","maybe"

However, only little is known about temporal variation in metacommunities and their underlying drivers. We examined temporal variation in the relative roles of environmental and spatial factors for diatom community composition among brackish-watered rock pools on the Baltic Sea coast over a 3-month period. We used a combination of direct ordination, variation partition, and Mantel tests to investigate the metacommunity patterns. The studied communities housed a mixture of freshwater, brackish, and marine species, with a decreasing share of salinity tolerant species along both temporal and spatial gradients. The community composition was explained by both environmental and spatial variables (especially conductivity and distance from the sea) in each month; the joint effect of these factors was consistently larger than the pure effects of either variable group. Community similarity was related to both environmental and spatial distance between the pools even when the other variable group was controlled for. The relative influence of environmental factors increased with time, accounting for the largest share of the variation in species composition and distance decay of similarity in July. Metacommunity organization in the studied rock pools was probably largely explained by a combination of species sorting and mass effect given the small spatial study scale. The found strong distance decay of community similarity indicates spatially highly heterogeneous diatom communities mainly driven by temporally varying conductivity gradient at the marine-freshwater transition zone.","2019","49","10.1007/s12526-019-01016-z","me","YES"

Sparsely-distributed freshwater systems in arid central Australia provide important refuges for mobile species and act as biotic reservoirs under adverse conditions. Some of these perennial systems are also evolutionary refugia that support relictual insects. Microbes play an important role in driving aquatic biogeochemical processes, but little is known about their composition and spatial patterns in and across these arid landscapes. Here we sought to assess the diversity and spatial distribution of aquatic Bacteria and Archaea in arid Australian waterbodies. We used 16s-rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to analyze the structure of microbial assemblages in biofilms and the water column from 8 waterbodies along a geographic axis across 2 drainage divisions. We used isotope hydrology to differentiate between groundwater-dominated waterbodies and those fed by surface water. We tested predictions and used metacommunity theory to explore spatial patterns between water column and biofilm microbiota, between perennial and temporary waterbodies, and between groundwater-fed and surface water-fed systems. We found greater similarity between assemblages of water column microbiota than those of the benthic biofilms. The spatial distributions of water column and biofilm assemblages were best explained by different metacommunity concepts. Distance decay matched the composition of the water column microbiota, whereas species sorting appeared to drive the composition of biofilm assemblages. The latter showed considerable within-site variability, changing with the type of benthic substrate present. Electrical conductivity and pH partly explained the composition of the water column and biofilm microbial assemblages, but only the water column microbiota was associated with the aquatic isotopic signatures. No distinctive microbiota were associated with perennial, groundwater-dominated sites previously identified as evolutionary refugia for aquatic insects. Temporary waterbodies contained significantly more heat and arid resilient microbial taxa commonly found in soils. Further investigation of temporal dynamics is now needed to determine how arid land aquatic microbiota might change under a warming climate.","2019","38","10.1086/706106","me","YES"

Unraveling the relative importance of stochastic versus deterministic processes in shaping biogeographic patterns of fungal communities has long been a challenge in microbial ecology, owing to high biodiversity and difficulties in identifying fungal taxa. Using a unique anthropogenic system of geographically isolated paddy islands, we collected 198 soil samples with a spatially explicit design to examine how ecological processes shaped fungal biogeographic patterns. Fungal community structure showed scale-dependent distance-decay relationships. Stochastic processes (dispersal and drift) contributed more to community assembly than deterministic processes (selection) at the local scale, which was largely attributed to drift. In contrast, deterministic processes contributed more to community assembly than stochastic processes at the regional scale, with soil dissolved organic carbon being the most important measured factor. Collectively, scale dependence of fungal biogeographical patterns in paddy soils is influenced by differential contribution of deterministic and stochastic processes.

Some Microcystis strains produce harmful toxins such as microcystin, impacting drinking water quality. Microcystis colony morphology, rather than genetic similarity, is often used to classify Microcystis into morphospecies. Yet colony morphology is a plastic trait, which can change depending on environmental and laboratory culture conditions, and is thus an inadequate criterion for species delineation. Furthermore, Microcystis populations are thought to disperse globally and constitute a homogeneous gene pool. However, this assertion is based on relatively incomplete characterization of Microcystis genomic diversity. To better understand these issues, we performed a population genomic analysis of 33 newly sequenced genomes mainly from Canada and Brazil. We identified 17 Microcystis clusters of genomic similarity, five of which correspond to monophyletic clades containing at least three newly sequenced genomes. Four out of these five clades match to named morphospecies. Notably, M. aeruginosa is paraphyletic, distributed across 12 genomic clusters, suggesting it is not a coherent species. A few clades of closely related isolates are specific to a unique geographic location, suggesting biogeographic structure over relatively short evolutionary time scales. Higher homologous recombination rates within than between clades further suggest that monophyletic groups might adhere to a Biological Species-like concept, in which barriers to gene flow maintain species distinctness. However, certain genes-including some involved in microcystin and micropeptin biosynthesis-are recombined between monophyletic groups in the same geographic location, suggesting local adaptation.","2019","13","10.1038/s41396-019-0481-1","me","NO"

Notably, members of the Rickettsiales genus Wolbachia influence several aspects of the fitness and evolution of their terrestrial hosts, but few analogous partnerships have been found in marine systems. We report here the genome, phylogenetics, and biogeography of a ubiquitous and novel Rickettsiales species that primarily associates with marine organisms. We previously showed that this bacterium was found in scleractinian corals, responds to nutrient exposure, and is associated with reduced host growth and increased mortality. This bacterium, like other Rickettsiales, has a reduced genome indicative of a parasitic lifestyle. Phylogenetic analysis places this Rickettsiales within a new genus we define as Candidatus Aquarickettsia. Using data from the Earth Microbiome Project and SRA databases, we also demonstrate that members of Ca. Aquarickettsia are found globally in dozens of invertebrate lineages. The coral-associated Candidatus A. rohweri is the first finished genome in this new Glade. Ca. A. rohweri lacks genes to synthesize most sugars and amino acids but possesses several genes linked to pathogenicity including Tlc, an antiporter that exchanges host ATP for ADP, and a complete Type IV secretion system. Despite its inability to metabolize nitrogen, Ca. A. rohweri possesses the NtrY-NtrX two-component system involved in sensing and responding to extracellular nitrogen. Given these data, along with visualization of the parasite in host tissues, we hypothesize that Ca. A. rohweri reduces coral health by consuming host nutrients and energy, thus weakening and eventually killing host cells.

However, the biogeography of soil fungi in the forest ecosystem is poorly understand, especially in arid or semiarid areas. Here, a regional scale study in an arid area was conducted on the Loess Plateau to illustrate the geographic distributions of soil fungi and their driving forces. The results showed that Ascomycota, Basidiomycota and Zygomycota were the most dominant phyla in 24 sample sites. Fungal Shannon diversity and OTUs richness were significantly correlated with mean annual precipitation (MAP), total soil nitrogen (TN), ammonium nitrogen (NH4N) and soil organic carbon (SOC) levels. The decay-curve analysis demonstrated that soil fungal Bray-Cutis dissimilarities were significantly regressed with geographic distance, revealing that the soil fungal community structure was affected by historical factors. Variation partitioning analysis revealed that the soil properties (15%) contributed more to the fungal community variations than geographic distance (9%). Additionally, there were many predictors of soil fungi geography that were not detected. These results suggest that the fungal geography on the Loess Plateau is mainly regulated by soil properties or other unmeasured variables. Such findings advance our understanding of fungal diversity patterns on the Loess Plateau, which will help us better understand the functions and services in underground ecosystems in arid areas.","2019","183","10.1016/j.catena.2019.104220","me","YES"

To what extent such legacy contamination affects the diversity and structure of the soil microbial communities is unclear. In this study, we used 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to investigate the prokaryotic microbiomes (bacteria and archaea) in the Ogosta river floodplain, which is contaminated because of historic mining and a tailings dam failure in 1964. We established a 700 m long soil transect exhibiting extreme contamination gradients particularly reflected in arsenic levels, ranging from < 50 mg to > 10 g per kg soil. Boosted regression trees analysis suggested that microbial biomass (soil DNA as proxy) and prokaryotic taxonomic and phylogenetic richness were mainly determined by the availability of limiting nutrients, first of all organic C, but were also positively related to the contamination. Taxonomic evenness was evidenced to be mainly determined by the contamination level, with more strongly contaminated soils harboring more even communities. Soil pH was indicated to play an important role in community shifts between the soils (beta-diversity). Functional profiling through hidden state prediction (HSP) evidenced that relative numbers of metal(loid) resistance and antioxidant defense genes were positively related to the level of contamination and tended to co-occur in the inferred genomes. Our results contrast the common prediction of decreased microbial biomass and diversity because of metal(loid) contamination. We suggest that in our study the net increase in prokaryotic community richness and evenness is related to mild toxicity diminishing competitive advantages of dominating OTUs, allowing other OTUs to thrive which were competitively excluded.","2019","144","10.1016/j.apsoil.2019.07.022","me","maybe"

Here we examine microbial (prokaryotic and eukaryotic) community changes associated with the surface low salinity layer (LSL) and underlying seawater in multiple fjords in Fiordland National Park (New Zealand). High rainfall (1200-8000 mm annually) and linked runoff from native forested catchments results in surface LSLs with high tannin concentrations within each fjord. These gradients are expected to drive changes in microbial communities. We used amplicon sequencing (16S and 18S) to assess the impact of these gradients on microbial communities and identified depth linked changes in diversity and community structure. With increasing depth, we observed significant increases in Proteobacteria (15%) and SAR (37%), decreases in Opisthokonta (35%), and transiently increased Bacteroidetes (3% increase from 0 to 40 m, decreasing by 8% at 200 m). Community structure differences were observed along a transect from the head to the mouth, specifically 25% mean relative abundance decreases in Opisthokonta and Bacteroidetes, and increases in SAR (25%) and Proteobacteria (>5%) at the surface, indicating changes based on distance from the ocean.

At least twelve distinct clades, or ecotypes, of Prochlorococcus have been discovered so far, and follow distinct distribution patterns over horizontal and vertical gradients in the oligotrophic ocean. However, multiple ecotypes (and sub-ecotypes) of Prochlorococcus always coexist in varying proportions. While laboratory experiments and genomic analysis suggest that ecotypes contribute differently to biogeochemical cycles, no studies have tested the differential activity of coexisting ecotypes in natural assemblages of Prochlorococcus. Here, we performed DNA stable isotope probing (DNA-SIP) experiments in on-deck incubations of oceanic microbial communities with C-13-labeled bicarbonate to identify ecotypes actively assimilating carbon. In addition, we identified cells in G1 and G2 phases of the cell cycle to determine the ecotypes engaged in cell division. We found that closely related ecotypes and sub-ecotypes could exhibit differential activity in carbon assimilation and cell division. In the case of cell division, the most actively dividing ecotype was among the most abundant ecotypes. In the case of carbon assimilation, both a rare OTU and an abundant OTU were the most active. We discuss how intrinsic genomic characteristics, acclimation state, microbial interactions, and physical dynamics of the ocean could contribute to these patterns of activity. Together, these experiments suggest that Prochlorococcus community structure is an important facet of Prochlorococcus contributions to the ocean ecosystem that should be studied further to predict the influence of Prochlorococcus on global processes.","2019","6","10.3389/fmars.2019.00701","me","NO"

From the environment where the vines grow, encompassing soil, topography, weather and climate through to management practices in vineyards, the microbes present can potentially change the composition of wine. Introduction of grapes into the winery and the start of winemaking processes modify microbial communities further. Recent advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology have progressed our understanding of microbial communities associated with grapes and fermentations. We now have a finer appreciation of microbial diversity across wine producing regions to begin to understand how diversity can contribute to wine quality and style characteristics. In this review, we highlight literature surrounding wine-related microorganisms and how these affect factors interact with and shape microbial communities and contribute to wine quality. By discussing the geography, climate and soil of environments and viticulture and winemaking practices, we claim microbial biogeography as a new perspective to impact wine quality and regionality. Depending on geospatial scales, habitats, and taxa, the microbial community respond to local conditions. We discuss the effect of a changing climate on local conditions and how this may alter microbial diversity and thus wine style. With increasing understanding of microbial diversity and their effects on wine fermentation, wine production can be optimised with enhancing the expression of regional characteristics by understanding and managing the microbes present.","2019","10","10.3389/fmicb.2019.02679","me","NO"

Additionally, patterns of genetic variation in interacting species can reveal ecological traits that are important to gene flow and co-evolution. In this study, we define patterns of spatial and temporal genetic variation of a coral reef fish, Siphamia tubifer, and its luminous bacterial symbiont, Photobacterium mandapamensis in the Okinawa Islands, Japan. Using restriction site-associated sequencing (RAD-Seq) methods, we show that populations of the facultative light organ symbiont of S. tubifer exhibit genetic structure at fine spatial scales of tens of kilometers despite the absence of physical barriers to dispersal and in contrast to populations of the host fish. These results suggest that the hosts behavioral ecology and environmental interactions between host and symbiont help to structure symbiont populations in the region, consequently fostering the specificity of the association between host generations. Our approach also revealed several symbiont genes that were divergent between host populations, including hfq and a homolog of varS, both of which play a role in host association in Vibrio cholerae. Overall, this study highlights the important role that a host animal can play in structuring the distribution of its bacterial symbiont, particularly in highly connected marine environments, thereby promoting specificity of the symbiosis between host generations.","2019","10","10.3389/fmicb.2019.02670","me","NO"

While surface nutrient supply impacts the elemental ratios of primary production, stoichiometric control by remineralization remains unclear. Here we develop a mechanistic description of remineralization and its stoichiometry in a marine microbial ecosystem model. The model simulates the observed elemental plasticity of phytoplankton and the relatively constant, lower C:N of heterotrophic biomass. In addition, the model captures the observed decreases in the C:N of more labile dissolved organic matter (DOM) and the C:N of its remineralization with depth, which are driven by a switch in the dominant source of DOM from phytoplankton to heterotrophic biomass. Only a model version with targeted remineralization of N-rich components is able to simulate the observed profiles of preferential remineralization of N relative to C and the elevated C:N of bulk DOM. The model suggests that more labile substrates are associated with C-limited heterotrophic growth and not with preferential remineralization, while less labile substrates are associated with growth limited by processing rates and with preferential remineralization. The resulting patterns of variable remineralization stoichiometry mediate the extent to which a proportional increase in carbon production resulting from changes in phytoplankton stoichiometry can increase the efficiency of the biological pump. Results emphasize the importance of understanding the physiology of both phytoplankton and heterotrophs for anticipating changes in biologically driven ocean carbon storage.","2019","33","10.1029/2019GB006375","me","NO"

Compared with the coastal ecosystem, studies comparing diversity and community structure of intertidal planktonic and benthic microeukaryotes are limited. Therefore, the ecological processes mediating their assemblies remain poorly understood. Environmental rRNA from two size fractions (nano- and micro-sized) of plankton and from seasonally collected (spring and summer) benthos, together with water and sediment chemistry and concentrations of heavy metals, were used to explore diversity and community structure of microeukaryotes in intertidal zones of southeast Fujian Province, China. Benthic microeukaryotes harbored significantly higher alpha-diversity than those of the plankton, whereas no distinct patterns of organism size/seasonal distribution were observed for either community. Community compositions differed significantly between planktonic and benthic microeukaryotes, with the former presenting size-fractionated discrepancies and the latter showing seasonal variation. Community turnover between planktonic and benthic microeukaryotes was mainly driven by stramenopiles and alveolates. Distance-decay patterns were found in both communities, with the rate of community turnover being higher for planktonic than benthic microeukaryotes. Among the environmental factors measured, the concentration of Cd and the water content of sediment were closely associated with benthic community variations, whereas none of the factors measured was identified as being responsible for planktonic community variation. Phylogenetic null model analysis indicated that dispersal limitation was the most crucial ecological process mediating community assembly for both planktonic and benthic microeukaryotes in intertidal zones, with heterogeneous selection making a higher contribution to community variation of benthic than planktonic microeukaryotes. Stochastic processes, mainly dispersal limitation, were found to prevail in both communities. This study thus provides new insights into the diversity distribution and assembly mechanism of microeukaryotes in intertidal zones.","2019","10","10.3389/fmicb.2019.02640","me","YES"

A close relationship between soil biodiversity and soil physicochemical properties (e.g. soil pH) is evident in most studies, but a large unexplained residual variance is usually reported. This suggests that a deeper exploration into the multidimensional nature of these biotic-abiotic interactions will help develop our understanding of how a combination of soil properties drives soil biodiversity more than any one soil attribute. This was tested by analysing the multivariate associations between soil microbial diversity and soil physicochemical heterogeneity across different Australian soil landscapes. The study area involved two orthogonal transects each of -1000 km across the state of New South Wales (NSW). A set of 33 abiotic attributes including soil properties and other key environmental covariates were correlated against a soil microbial DNA dataset (16S rRNA and ITS genes) to profile the soil bio-physicochemical relationships. This was undertaken for two land use archetypes representing natural and managed ecosystems. The study found that soil microbial communities were highly related to multiple soil attributes and vegetation. Even though the extent of these relationships varied depending on the environmental scenario and the structural microbial community component analysed, the multidimensional association with soil heterogeneity was evident beyond any single soil property, environmental gradient or land use.","2019","354","10.1016/j.geoderma.2019.07.018","me","maybe"

Previous studies report that anammox bacteria are distributed in a wide range of habitats and plays significant roles in the global nitrogen cycle. However, most studies focus only on individual ecosystems or datasets from public databases. To date, our understanding of how anammox bacteria respond to environmental properties and are distributed in different habitats on a global scale, remain unclear. To explore the global distribution of anammox bacteria, samples were collected from different habitats at different locations globally, including wetlands, drylands, groundwater aquifers and snow from 10 countries across six continents. We then used high-throughput amplicon sequencing targeting the functional gene hydrazine synthase (HZS) and generated community profiles. Results showed that Candidatus Brocadia is detected as the dominant genus on a global scale, accounting for 80.0% to 99.9% of the retrieved sequences in different habitats. The Jettenia-like sequences were the second most abundant group, accounting for no more than 19.9% of the retrieved sequences in all sites. The samples in drylands, wetlands and groundwater aquifers showed similar community composition and diversity, with the snow samples being the most different. Deterministic processes seem stronger in regulating the community composition of anammox bacteria, which is supported by the higher proportion explained by local-scale factors. Groundwater aquifers showed high gene abundance and the most complex co-occurrence network among the four habitat types, suggesting that it might be the preferred habitat of anammox bacteria. There is little competition between anammox bacterial species based on co-occurrence analysis. Hence, we could infer that environmental factors such as anaerobic and stable conditions, instead of substrate limitations, may be vital factors determining the anammox bacteria community. These results provide a better understanding of the global distribution of anammox bacteria and the ecological factors that affect their community structuring in diverse habitats.","2019","10","10.3389/fmicb.2019.02583","me","maybe"

Microbial communities found within peat-rich systems are important biogeochemical cyclers in terms of methane and carbon dioxide sequestration. To address the critical lack of knowledge about microbial communities in tropical (peat-draining) rivers, this study represents the first seasonal assessment targeted at establishing a foundational understanding of the microbial communities of the Rajang River-South China Sea continuum. This was carried out utilising 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing via Illumina MiSeq in size-fractionated samples (0.2 and 3.0 mu m GF/C filter membranes) covering different biogeographical features and sources from headwaters to coastal waters. The microbial communities found along the Rajang River exhibited taxa common to rivers (i.e. predominance of beta-Proteobacteria) while estuarine and marine regions exhibited taxa that were common to the aforementioned regions as well (i.e. predominance of alpha- and gamma-Proteobacteria). This is in agreement with studies from other rivers which observed similar changes along salinity gradients. In terms of particulate versus free-living bacteria, nonmetric multi-dimensional scaling (NMDS) results showed similarly distributed microbial communities with varying separation between seasons. Distinct patterns were observed based on linear models as a result of the changes in salinity along with variation of other biogeochemical parameters. Alpha diversity indices indicated that microbial communities were higher in diversity upstream compared to the marine and estuarine regions, whereas anthropogenic perturbations led to increased richness but less diversity. Despite the observed changes in bacterial community composition and diversity that occur along the continuum of the Rajang River to the sea, the PICRUSt predictions showed minor variations. The results provide essential context for future studies such as further analyses on the ecosystem response to anthropogenic land-use practices and probable development of biomarkers to improve the monitoring of water quality in this region.","2019","16","10.5194/bg-16-4243-2019","me","YES"

The typical argument has been that phytoplankton is ubiquitous, but that distinct assemblages form under environmental selection. It is well established that phytoplankton assemblages vary considerably between coastal ecosystems. However, the relative roles of compartmentalization of regional seas and site-specific environmental conditions in shaping assemblage structures have not been specifically examined. We collected data from coastal embayments that fall within two different water compartments within the same regional sea and are characterized by highly localized environmental pressures. We used principal coordinates of neighbour matrices (PCNM) and asymmetric eigenvector maps (AEM) models to partition the effects that spatial structures, environmental conditions and their overlap had on the variation in assemblage composition. Our models explained a high percentage of variation in assemblage composition (59-65%) and showed that spatial structure consistent with marine compartmentalization played a more important role than local environmental conditions. At least during the study period, surface currents connecting sites within the two compartments failed to generate sufficient dispersal to offset the impact of differences due to compartmentalization. In other words, our findings suggest that, even for a prototypical cosmopolitan group, everything is not everywhere.","2019","286","10.1098/rspb.2019.1890","me","YES"

However, it remains challenging to quantitatively evaluate the contribution of this process to the microbial diversity and function in the receiving ecosystems. Currently used methods, i.e., counting shared microbial species, microbial source tracking, and neutral community model, rely on abundance profile to reveal the extent of overlapping between the upstream and downstream communities. Thus, they cannot suggest the quantitative contribution of immigrants to the downstream community function because activities of individual immigrants are not considered after entering the receiving environment. This limitation can be overcome by using an approach that couples a mass balance model with high-throughput DNA sequencing, i.e., ecogenomics-based mass balance. It calculates the net growth rate of individual microbial immigrants and partitions the entire community into active populations that contribute to the community function and inactive ones that carry minimal function. Linking activities of immigrants to their abundance further provides quantification of the contribution from an upstream environment to the downstream community. Considering only active populations can improve the accuracy of identifying key environmental parameters dictating process performance using methods such as machine learning.","2019","7","10.1186/s40168-019-0760-0","me","NO"

In particular, recent work on quantitative resource allocation allow us to formulate mechanistic models of microbial growth that are physiologically meaningful while remaining computationally tractable. These models go beyond Michaelis-Menten and Monod-type growth models, and are capable of accounting for emergent properties that underlie the remarkable plasticity of microbial growth. We outline the utility and advantages of using biochemical resource allocation models by considering a coarse-grained model of cyanobacterial growth and demonstrate how the model allows us to address specific questions of relevance for the simulation of marine microbial ecosystems, including the physiological acclimation of protein expression to different environments, the description of co-limitation by several nutrients and the differential use of alternative nutrient sources, as well as the description of metabolic diversity based on our increasing knowledge about quantitative cell physiology.","2019","16","10.1098/rsif.2019.0474","me","NO"

However, it remains uncertain how these changes will impact the structure of downstream resident freshwater microbial communities and ensuing microbially driven freshwater ecosystem services. Using the Lake Hazen watershed (Nunavut, Canada; 82 degrees N, 71 degrees W) as a sentinel system, we related microbial community composition (16S rRNA gene sequencing) to physicochemical parameters (e.g. dissolved oxygen and nutrients) over an annual hydrological cycle in three freshwater compartments within the watershed: (i) glacial rivers; (ii) active layer thaw-fed streams and waterbodies and (iii) Lake Hazen, into which (i) and (ii) drain. Microbial communities throughout these freshwater compartments were strongly interconnected, hydrologically, and often correlated with the presence of melt-sourced chemicals (e.g. dissolved inorganic carbon) as the melt season progressed. Within Lake Hazen itself, water column microbial communities were generally stable over spring and summer, despite fluctuating lake physicochemistry, indicating that these communities and the potential ecosystem services they provide therein may be resilient to environmental change. This work helps to establish a baseline understanding of how microbial communities and the ecosystem services they provide in Arctic watersheds might respond to future climate change.","2019","95","10.1093/femsec/fiz161","me","YES"

However, it is often unclear to what extent differences in community composition across different regions are caused by dispersal limitation or selection, and if selection is caused by local environmental conditions alone or additional broad-scale region-specific factors. This is especially true for groundwater environments, which have been understudied in this context relative to other non-subsurface habitats. Here, we analyzed microbial community composition based on exact 16S rRNA amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) from four geographically separated aquifers located in different regions along a latitudinal transect of similar to 700 km across Germany. Using a combination of variation partitioning and ecological null models revealed that differences in microbial community composition were mainly the product of selection imposed by local environmental conditions and to a smaller but still significant extent dispersal limitation and drift across regions. Only similar to 23% of the total variation in microbial community composition remained unexplained, possibly due to underestimated effects of dispersal limitation among local communities within regions and temporal drift. No evidence was found for selection due to region-specific factors independent of local environmental conditions.","2019","95","10.1093/femsec/fiz160","me","YES"

While several studies have targeted the prokaryotic sand filter communities, little is known about the eukaryotic communities, despite the obvious need for knowledge of microorganisms that get in contact with human drinking water. With a new general eukaryotic primer set (18S, V1-V3 region), we performed FLX-454 sequencing of material from 21 waterworks sand filters varying in age (3-40 years) and geographical location on a 250 km east-west axis in Denmark, and put the data in context of their previously published prokaryotic communities. We find that filters vary highly in trophic complexity depending on age, from simple systems with bacteria and protozoa (3-6 years) to complex, mature systems with nematodes, rotifers and turbellarians as apex predators (40 years). Unlike the bacterial communities, the eukaryotic communities display a clear distance-decay relationship that predominates over environmental variations, indicating that the underlying aquifers feeding the filters harbor distinct eukaryotic communities with limited dispersal in between. Our findings have implications for waterworks filter management, and offer a window down to the largely unexplored eukaryotic microbiology of groundwater aquifers.","2019","95","10.1093/femsec/fiz148","me","YES"

However, the relative importance of different biotic and abiotic factors in determining the bacterial community has not been properly clarified. In this study, the effects of inocula and recipients on the assembly of the soil community were investigated to evaluate their importance by inoculation experiments with sterile soil. Two distinct soils, conventional nitrogen-fertilized soil and aromatic-compound-contaminated soil, were sterilized, cross inoculated, and incubated for 2 months under different inoculation doses and oxygen conditions. The results showed that the greatest variation in community structure emerged in the samples inoculated with distinct inocula rather than in the samples of different soil recipients. The phylogenies in the two inocula were diverse and dissimilar, although there were many ecologically equivalent bacteria. When the inocula with dissimilar ecologically equivalent species were used, the assembled communities were primarily determined by the inocula as indicated by the beta diversity and variation partitioning analyses. In contrast, environmental selection dominated the process when ecologically equivalent species in the inocula were similar, as when only one type of inoculum was used, where the soil habitat selected the most adaptive bacteria from the defined inoculum pool. These results indicate that inoculated bacteria are dominant over environmental selection if they are sufficiently dissimilar, although the effect of environmental selection is more obvious when similar bacteria are inoculated in the soil for community assembly. Our findings suggest that the immigration of exotic bacteria could be a primary factor impacting community assembly. IMPORTANCE The soil microbiota conducts important biological ecosystem functions, but the mechanism underlying community-environment interactions for soil microbiota remains unclear. By using two distinct soils for cross inoculation, we successfully simulated the assembly of the bacterial community in sterile soil. Thus, the reasons why inoculum and recipient have dominated community assembly in previous investigations are investigated in this study. We found that inoculated bacteria presided over environmental selection for community assembly due to the varied difference of ecological equivalent bacteria, either divergent or convergent. The significance of neutrality for the ecologically equivalent bacterial species that immigrated into the recipients should be emphasized in exploring the mechanisms of community assembly. Our finding is helpful for understanding the community- environment interaction, a basic question in ecology, and it would shed light on this issue that has perplexed scientists for many years.","2019","4","10.1128/mSystems.00496-19","me","maybe"

The distribution and biogeography of these ammonia oxidizers might be distinctive in high-elevation rivers, which are generally characterized by low temperature and low ammonium concentration but strong solar radiation; however, these characteristics have rarely been documented. This study explored the abundance, community, and activity of ammonia oxidizers in the overlying water of five rivers in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). Potential nitrification rates in these rivers ranged from 5.4 to 38.4 nmol N liter(-1) h(-1), and they were significantly correlated with ammonium concentration rather than temperature. Comammox were found in 25 of the total 28 samples, and they outnumbered AOA in three samples. Contrary to most studied low-elevation rivers, average AOB amoA gene abundance was significantly higher than that of AOA, and AOB/AOA ratios increased with decreasing water temperature. The Simpson index of the AOA community increased with elevation (P < 0.05), and AOA and AOB communities exhibited high dissimilarities with low-elevation rivers. Cold-adapted (Nitrosospira amoA cluster 1, 33.6%) and oligotrophic (Nitrosomonas amoA cluster 6a, 31.7%) groups accounted for large proportions in the AOB community. Suspended sediment concentration exerted significant effects on ammonia oxidizer abundance (r > 0.56), and owing to their elevational variations in source and concentration, suspended sediments facilitated distance-decay patterns for AOA and AOB community similarities. This study demonstrates distinctive biogeography and distribution patterns for ammonia oxidizers in high-elevation rivers of the QTP. Extensive research should be conducted to explore the role of these microbes in the nitrogen cycle of this zone. IMPORTANCE Ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB) as well as co-mammox contribute to ammonia oxidation, which plays significant roles in riverine nitrogen cycle and N2O production. Source regions of numerous rivers in the world lie in high-elevation zones, but the abundance, community, and activity of ammonia oxidizers in rivers in high-elevation regions have rarely been investigated. This study revealed distinctive distribution patterns and community structures for ammonia oxidizers in five high-elevation rivers of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and the individual and combined effects of low temperature, low nutrients, and strong solar radiation on ammonia oxidizers were elucidated. The findings of this study are helpful to broaden our knowledge on the biogeography and distribution pattern of ammonia oxidizers in river systems.

However, when compared with the northern Mid-Atlantic Ridge (NMAR), the SMAR has not been extensively explored. In particular, there is little information on the vent ecology, with no comprehensive ecological surveys conducted along the SMAR south of 10 degrees S. In 2011, a new hydrothermal vent field, named Deyin-1, was discovered on the SMAR at 15.17 degrees S. In this study, we recorded hydrothermal vent fauna and microbial diversity in both the hydrothermal plumes and deposits of Deyin-1. The biodiversity and distribution of the vent inhabitants were surveyed by phylogenetic analysis, high-throughput pyrosequencing, and in situ observation using a remotely operated vehicle. Results showed that the predominant primary consumers were shrimp (Rimicaris exoculate), crabs (Segonzacia maatlantica), and Bathymodiolus-like mussels, in addition to the common vent predators Macrouridae fish (Cetonurus globiceps), eelpout-like fish, and suspected octopuses. Phylogenetic analysis based on the mitochondria cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene and nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis based on the vent fauna occurrence data revealed that the Deyin-1 vent fauna was closely related to species found on the NMAR. Sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (SOB) of the SUP05 Glade and ammonia-oxidizing archaea belonging to the phylum Thaumarchaeota dominated the vent plume microbial community. Putative thermophilic hydrogenoxidizing chemo-lithoautotrophs, including those belonging to archaeal genera Archaeogiobus and Methanocaldococcus and bacterial genera Desulfurobacterium and Nautilia, dominated the active chimney community, as well as a putative hyperthermophilic sulfur-reducing chemo-organoheterotroph belonging to archaeal genus Thermococcus. While Sulfurovum SOB constituted the predominant episymbionts of the vent shrimp.

Here, microbial communities were characterized for 29 sites across multiple years in >700 samples. The composition of the seafloor microbiome was broadly consistent across the region and was well approximated by the overlying water depth and depth within the sediment column, while geographic distance played a limited role. Biogeographical distributions were employed to generate predictive models for over 4000OTU that leverage easy-to-obtain geospatial variables which are linked to measured sedimentary oxygen profiles. Depth stratification and putative niche diversification are evidenced by the distribution of taxa that mediate the microbial nitrogen cycle. Furthermore, these results demonstrate that sediments impacted by the DWH spill had returned to near baseline conditions after 2years. The distributions of benthic microorganisms in the Gulf can be constrained, and moreover, deviations from these predictions may pinpoint impacted sites and aid in future response efforts or long-term stability studies.","2019","21","10.1111/1462-2920.14794","me","maybe"

However, the distribution of fungal communities in the ocean, especially the vertical distribution along depth in the water column, remained poorly understood. Here, we assess the depth-related distribution pattern of fungal communities along the water column from epi- to abyssopelagic zones of the Western Pacific Ocean using internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) metabarcoding. Majority of the assigned OTUs were affiliated to Ascomycota, followed by three other minor phyla (Basidiomycota, Chytridiomycota, and Mucoromycota). The epipelagic zone harbored a higher OTU richness with distinct fungal communities as compared with meso-, bathy-, and abyssopelagic zones. Across the whole water column, depth appears as a key parameter for both fungal alpha- and beta-diversity. However, when the dataset was split into the upper (5-500 m) and deeper (below 500 m) layers, no significant correlation was observed between depth and community compositions. In the upper layer, temperature and dissolved oxygen were recognized as the primary environmental factors shaping fungal alpha- and beta- diversity. By parsing fungal OTUs into ecological categories, multi-trophic mode of nutrition was found to be more prevalent with increasing depth, suggesting a potential adaptation to the extreme conditions of the deep sea. This study provides new and meaningful information on the depth-stratified fungal diversity, community structure, and putative ecological roles in the open sea.","2019","78","10.1007/s00248-019-01374-y","me","maybe"

However, several different cotton-strip assays are routinely used, complicating the interpretation of results across studies, and hindering broader synthesis. Here, we compare the decay rates and assemblages of bacteria and fungi colonizing the three most commonly used cotton materials: Artists canvas, Calico cloth, and Empa fabric. Cotton strips from each material type were incubated in 10 streams that span a wide range of physicochemical properties across five ecoregions. Additionally, to evaluate responses to environmental stress without potentially confounding biogeographical effects, we deployed identical bioassays in five streams across an acidification gradient within a single ecoregion. Across all streams decomposition rates (as tensile strength loss [TSL]) differed among the three cotton materials; Calico cloth decomposed fastest (time to 50% TSL [T-50] = 16.7 d), followed by the Empa fabric (T-50 = 18.3 d) and then Artists canvas (T-50 = 21.4 d). Despite these differences, rates of TSL of the three cotton materials responded consistently to variation in environmental conditions; TSL of each fabric increased with stream temperature, dissolved-nutrient concentrations and acid-neutralizing capacity, although Artists canvas and Calico cloth were more sensitive than Empa fabric. Microbial communities were similar among the materials, and values of community structure (e.g., phylotype richness and diversity) were comparable to those reported for decaying leaves in streams from the same region, the major natural basal carbon resource in forested-stream ecosystems. We present linear calibrations among pairs of assays so that past and future studies can be expressed in a common currency (e.g., Artists-fabric equivalents) past and future studies repeated two times in the sentence. Lastly, given its relatively low within-site variability, and the large number of streams where it has been used ( > 700 across the globe), we recommend Artists fabric for future work. These results show that cotton provides an effective and realistic standardized substrate for studying heterotrophic microbial assemblages, and acts as a reasonable proxy for more chemically complex forms of detritus. These findings add to growing evidence that cotton-strip bioassays are simple, effective and easily standardized indicators of heterotrophic microbial activity and the ecosystem processes that result.","2019","106","10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.105466","me","NO"

However, whether this niche segregation is maintained under field conditions in terrestrial ecosystems remains unresolved, particularly at the global scale. We hypothesized that perennial vegetation might favor AOB vs. AOA communities compared with adjacent open areas devoid of perennial vegetation (i.e., bare soil) via several mechanisms, including increasing the amount of ammonium in soil. To test this niche-differentiation hypothesis, we conducted a global field survey including 80 drylands from 6 continents. Data supported our hypothesis, as soils collected under plant canopies had higher levels of ammonium, as well as higher richness (number of terminal restriction fragments; T-RFs) and abundance (qPCR amoA genes) of AOB, and lower richness and abundance of AOA, than those collected in open areas located between plant canopies. Some of the reported associations between plant canopies and AOA and AOB communities can be a consequence of the higher organic matter and available N contents found under plant canopies. Other aspects of soils associated with vegetation including shading and microclimatic conditions might also help explain our results. Our findings provide strong evidence for niche differentiation between AOA and AOB communities in drylands worldwide, advancing our understanding of their ecology and biogeography at the global scale.","2019","13","10.1038/s41396-019-0465-1","me","maybe"

How the specialization of guilds of organisms varies along environmental gradients underpins popular theories of biogeography and macroecology, whereas the degree of specialization of a species is typically considered fixed. However, the extent to which environmental context impacts specialization dynamics is seldom examined empirically. In this study, we examine how specialization within a bipartite network consisting of three co-occurring plant species and their foliar fungal endophyte symbionts changes along a 1000-meter elevation gradient where host species were held constant. The gradient, along the slope of Mauna Loa shield volcano, represents almost the entire elevational range of two of the three plants. Network and plant specialization values displayed a parabolic relationship with elevation, and were highest at middle elevations, whereas bipartite associations were least specific at low and high elevations. Shannons diversity of fungal endophytes correlated negatively with specificity, and was highest at the ends of the transects. Although plant host was a strong determinant of fungal community composition within sites, fungal species turnover was high among sites. There was no evidence of spatial or elevational patterning in fungal community compositon. Our work demonstrates that specificity can be a plastic trait, which is influenced by the environment and centrality of the host within its natural range.","2019","13","10.1038/s41396-019-0470-4","me","maybe"

We manually increased the abundance of six randomly chosen resident bacterial species in separate, closed, communities and allowed the communities to recover in situ for 1 year. The single episode of increase in the abundance of different species drove species-specific community divergence accompanied by a decline in local diversity. Four of the six added species caused a decrease in the abundance of their closely related species, suggesting an important role of interspecific competition in driving the observed community divergence. Our results also suggested a lack of effective population regulations to force the relative abundance of manipulated species to revert to original level, which would allow persistence of the divergence among soil bacterial communities. We concluded that biotic interactions were important in determining soil bacterial community composition, which could result in substantial variation in soil bacterial community composition in abiotically homogenous environment.","2019","13","10.1038/s41396-019-0477-x","me","maybe"

Here, we explored the response patterns of abundant and rare bacterial taxa to disturbances by invasive plant growth and oil contamination in agricultural soils across a large spatial scale (latitude gradient = 18.62 degrees-46.51 degrees). Our meta-analysis based on existing Illumina sequencing datasets showed that abundant taxa persisted under the disturbances whereas rare taxa were more easily affected, indicating the higher resilience or resistance of abundant taxa to disturbances. The responses of abundant taxa were associated with mean annual temperature at the sampling sites, while rare taxa instead showed stochastic responses. There were significantly negative linear regressions between bacterial alpha-diversity and community dissimilarities (disturbed vs. undisturbed soils), suggesting stronger resilience or resistance in those bacterial communities with higher alpha-diversity. This resilience or resistance was mainly associated with the alpha-diversity of abundant taxa. Our network analysis showed that the disturbances substantially decreased the strength of the connections, loosened the co occurrence relationships, and reshaped the complex bacterial interactions. In the undisturbed soils, abundant taxa were located in central positions within the network more often than were rare taxa, while these trends were reversed in the disturbed soils. Our results suggest that abundant taxa play a dominant role in the stability and maintenance of agro-soil bacterial communities, while rare taxa could greatly influence local bacterial interactions under environmental disturbances.

Rhodnius pallescens is a major vector of Chagas disease in Panama. Understanding the microbial ecology of disease vectors is important in the development of vector management strategies that target vector survival and fitness. In this study we examined the whole-body microbial composition of R. pallescens from three locations in Panama. Methods: We collected 89 R. pallescens specimens using Noireau traps in Attalea butyracea palms. We then extracted total DNA from whole-bodies of specimens and amplified bacterial microbiota using 16S rRNA metabarcoding PCR. The 16S libraries were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq and analyzed using QIIME2 software. Results: We found Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes to be the most abundant bacterial phyla across all samples. Geographical location showed the largest difference in microbial composition with northern Veraguas Province having the most diversity and Panama Oeste Province localities being most similar to each other. Wolbachia was detected in high abundance (48-72%) at Panama Oeste area localities with a complete absence of detection in Veraguas Province. No significant differences in microbial composition were detected between triatomine age class, primary blood meal source, or T. cruzi infection status. Conclusions: We found biogeographical regions differ in microbial composition among R. pallescens populations in Panama. While overall the microbiota has bacterial taxa consistent with previous studies in triatomine microbial ecology, locality differences are an important observation for future studies. Geographical heterogeneity in microbiomes of vectors is an important consideration for future developments that leverage microbiomes for disease control.","2019","12","10.1186/s13071-019-3761-8","me","NO"

In these ecosystems, bacteria and archaea can oxidize the released iron and therefore play an important role in the biogeochemical cycles of essential nutrients. These organisms often form microbial mats, and the primary producers in these communities can support diverse higher trophic levels. One such class of bacteria are the Zetaproteobacteria. This class of bacteria oxidize iron and commonly produce extracellular iron oxyhydroxide matrices that provide architecture to the microbial mats, so they are considered foundational members of the community and ecosystem engineers. Zetaproteobacteria are responsible for the majority of iron-oxidation in circumneutral, marine, low-oxygen environments. To study the composition of these communities, microbial mats were collected using a biomat sampler, which allows for fine-scale collection of microbial mats. DNA was then extracted and amplified for analysis of the SSU rRNA gene. After quality control and filtering, the SSU rRNA genes from Mariana Arc and Loihi Seamount microbial mat communities were compared pairwise to determine which site exhibits a greater microbial diversity and how much community overlap exists between the two sites. In-depth analysis was performed with the rule-based microbial network (RMN) algorithm, which identified a possible competitive relationship across oligotypes of a cosmopolitan Zetaproteobacteria operational taxonomic unit (OTU). This result demonstrated the ecological relevance of oligotypes, or fine-scale OTU variants. The oligotype distributions of the cosmopolitan ZetaOTUs varied greatly across the Pacific Ocean. The competitive relationship between dominant oligotypes at Loihi Seamount and the Mariana Arc and back-arc may be driving their differential distributions across the two regions and may result in species divergence within a cosmopolitan ZetaOTU. This implementation of the RMN algorithm can both predict directional relationships within a community and provide insight to the level at which evolution is occurring across ecosystems.","2019","10","10.3389/fmicb.2019.02389","me","maybe"

However, the relative importance of these processes in shaping riverine microeukaryotic biogeography is still poorly understood. Here, we compared the spatiotemporal and biogeographical patterns of microeukaryotic community using high-throughput sequencing of 18S rRNA gene and multivariate statistical analyses from a subtropical river during wet and dry seasons. Results Our results provide the first description of biogeographical patterns of microeukaryotic communities in the Tingjiang River, the largest river in the west of Fujian province, southeastern China. The results showed that microeukaryotes from both wet and dry seasons exhibited contrasting community compositions, which might be owing to planktonic microeukaryotes having seasonal succession patterns. Further, all components of the microeukaryotic communities (including total, dominant, always rare, and conditionally rare taxa) exhibited a significant distance-decay pattern in both seasons, and these communities had a stronger distance-decay relationship during the dry season, especially for the conditionally rare taxa. Although several variables had a significant influence on the microeukaryotic communities, the environmental and spatial factors showed minor roles in shaping the communities. Importantly, these microeukaryotic communities were strongly driven by stochastic processes, with 89.9%, 88.5%, and 89.6% of the community variation explained by neutral community model during wet, dry, and both seasons, respectively. The neutral community model also explained a large fraction of the community variation across different taxonomic groups and levels. Additionally, the microeukaryotic taxa, which were above and below the neutral prediction, were ecologically and taxonomically distinct groups, which might be interactively structured by deterministic and stochastic processes. Conclusions This study demonstrated that stochastic processes are sufficient in shaping substantial variation in river microeukaryotic metacommunity across different hydrographic regimes, thereby providing a better understanding of spatiotemporal patterns, processes, and mechanisms of microeukaryotic community in waters.","2019","7","10.1186/s40168-019-0749-8","me","YES"

Here, we describe the first systematic study of an archaeal plasmid family, the pT26-2 plasmid family. The in-depth analysis of the distribution, biogeography and host-plasmid co-evolution patterns of 26 integrated and 3 extrachromosomal plasmids of this plasmid family shows that they are widespread in Thermococcales and Methanococcales isolated from around the globe but are restricted to these two orders. All members of the family share seven core genes but employ different integration and replication strategies. Phylogenetic analysis of the core genes and CRISPR spacer distribution suggests that plasmids of the pT26-2 family evolved with their hosts independently in Thermococcales and Methanococcales, despite these hosts exhibiting similar geographic distribution. Remarkably, core genes are conserved even in integrated plasmids that have lost replication genes and/or replication origins suggesting that they may be beneficial for their hosts. We hypothesize that the core proteins encode for a novel type of DNA/protein transfer mechanism, explaining the widespread oceanic distribution of the pT26-2 plasmid family.","2019","21","10.1111/1462-2920.14800","me","NO"

Despite their importance, there is virtually no knowledge about bioaerosols emitted by pristine forests. Here we provide the very first survey of the prokaryotic community of a bioaerosol collected inside pristine Amazon forest at 2 m above ground. Total atmospheric particles were collected at the Amazon Tall Tower Observatory, subjected to metagenomic DNA extraction and the prokaryotic diversity was determined by 16S rRNA gene ampl icon sequencing. A total of 271,577 reads of 250 bp of the 16S rRNA gene amplicon were obtained. Only 27% of the reads could be classified using the 165 SILVA database. Most belonged to Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Firmicutes which is in good agreement with other bioaerosol studies. Further inspection of the reads using Blast searches and the 18S SILVA database revealed that most of the dataset was composed of Fungi sequences.

However, there is significant heterogeneity in salinity influences on TAI soil biogeochemical function. This heterogeneity is perhaps related to unrecognized mechanisms associated with carbon (C) chemistry and microbial communities. To investigate this potential, we evaluated hypotheses associated with salinity-associated shifts in organic C thermodynamics; biochemical transformations; and nitrogen-, phosphorus-, and sulfur-containing heteroatom organic compounds in a first-order coastal watershed on the Olympic Peninsula of Washington, USA. In contrast to our hypotheses, thermodynamic favorability of water-soluble organic compounds in shallow soils decreased with increasing salinity (43-867 mu S cm(-1)), as did the number of inferred biochemical transformations and total heteroatom content. These patterns indicate lower microbial activity at higher salinity that is potentially constrained by accumulation of less-favorable organic C. Furthermore, organic compounds appeared to be primarily marine- or algae-derived in forested floodplain soils with more lipid-like and protein-like compounds, relative to upland soils that had more lignin-, tannin-, and carbohydrate-like compounds. Based on a recent simulation-based study, we further hypothesized a relationship between C chemistry and the ecological assembly processes governing microbial community composition. Null modeling revealed that differences in microbial community composition - assayed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing - were primarily the result of limited exchange of organisms among communities (i.e., dispersal limitation). This results in unstructured demographic events that cause community composition to diverge stochastically, as opposed to divergence in community composition being due to deterministic selection-based processes associated with differences in environmental conditions. The strong influence of stochastic processes was further reflected in there being no statistical relationship between community assembly processes (e.g., the relative influence of stochastic assembly processes) and C chemistry (e.g., heteroatom content). This suggests that microbial community composition does not have a mechanistic or causal linkage to C chemistry. The salinity-associated gradient in C chemistry was, therefore, likely influenced by a combination of spatially structured inputs and salinity-associated metabolic responses of microbial communities that were independent of community composition. We propose that impacts of salinity on coastal soil biogeochemistry need to be understood in the context of C chemistry, hydrologic or depositional dynamics, and microbial physiology, while microbial composition may have less influence.","2019","16","10.5194/bg-16-3911-2019","me","maybe"

HGT events often involve mobile genetic elements like plasmids, which can promote their own dissemination by associating with adaptive traits in the gene pool of the so-called mobilome. Novel traits that evolve through HGT can therefore lead to the exploitation of new ecological niches, prompting an adaptive radiation of bacterial species. In this study, we present phylogenetic, biogeographic, and functional analyses of a previously unrecognized RepL-type plasmid found in diverse members of the marine Roseobacter group across the globe. Noteworthy, 100% identical plasmids were detected in phylogenetically and geographically distant bacteria, revealing a so-far overlooked, but environmentally highly relevant vector for HGT. The genomic and functional characterization of this plasmid showed a completely conserved backbone dedicated to replication, stability, and mobilization as well as an interchangeable gene cassette with highly diverse, but recurring motifs. The majority of the latter appear to be involved in mechanisms coping with toxins and/or pollutants in the marine environment. Furthermore, we provide experimental evidence that the plasmid has the potential to be transmitted across bacterial orders, thereby increasing our understanding of evolution and microbial niche adaptation in the environment.","2019","116","10.1073/pnas.1905878116","me","NO"

Most isolated to date infect nonmarine protists, leaving their strategies and prevalence in marine environments largely unknown. Using eukaryotic single-cell metagenomics in the Pacific, we discovered a Mimiviridae lineage of giant viruses, which infects choanoflagellates, widespread protistan predators related to metazoans. The ChoanoVirus genomes are the largest yet from pelagic ecosystems, with 442 of 862 predicted proteins lacking known homologs. They are enriched in enzymes for modifying organic compounds, including degradation of chitin, an abundant polysaccharide in oceans, and they encode 3 divergent type-1 rhodopsins (VirR) with distinct evolutionary histories from those that capture sunlight in cellular organisms. One (VirR(DTS)) is similar to the only other putative rhodopsin from a virus (PgV) with a known host (a marine alga). Unlike the algal virus, ChoanoViruses encode the entire pigment biosynthesis pathway and cleavage enzyme for producing the required chromophore, retinal. We demonstrate that the rhodopsin shared by ChoanoViruses and PgV binds retinal and pumps protons. Moreover, our 1.65-angstrom resolved VirRDTS crystal structure and mutational analyses exposed differences from previously characterized type-1 rhodopsins, all of which come from cellular organisms. Multiple VirR types are present in metagenomes from across surface oceans, where they are correlated with and nearly as abundant as a canonical marker gene from Mimiviridae. Our findings indicate that light-dependent energy transfer systems are likely common components of giant viruses of photosynthetic and phagotrophic unicellular marine eukaryotes.","2019","116","10.1073/pnas.1907517116","me","NO"
"Salmaso, N","Effects of Habitat Partitioning on the Distribution of Bacterioplankton in Deep Lakes","FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY","In deep lakes, many investigations highlighted the existence of exclusive groups of bacteria adapted to deep oxygenated and hypoxic and anoxic hypolimnia. Nevertheless, the extent of bacterial strain diversity has been much less scrutinized. This aspect is essential for an unbiased estimation of genetic variation, biodiversity, and population structure, which are essential for studying important research questions such as biogeographical patterns, temporal and spatial variability and the environmental factors affecting this variability. This study investigated the bacterioplankton community in the epilimnetic layers and in the oxygenated and hypoxic/anoxic hypolimnia of five large and deep lakes located at the southern border of the Alps using high throughput sequencing (HTS) analyses (16S rDNA) and identification of amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) resolving reads differing by as little as one nucleotide. The study sites, which included two oligomictic (Garda and Como) and three meromictic lakes (Iseo, Lugano, and Idro) with maximum depths spanning from 124 to 410 m, were chosen among large lakes to represent an oxic-hypoxic gradient. The analyses showed the existence of several unique ASVs in the three layers of the five lakes. In the case of cyanobacteria, this confirmed previous analyses made at the level of strains or based on oligotyping methods. As expected, the communities in the hypoxic/anoxic monimolimnia showed a strong differentiation from the oxygenated layer, with the exclusive presence in single lakes of several unique ASVs. In the meromictic lakes, results supported the hypothesis that the formation of isolated monimolimnia sustained the development of highly diversified bacterial communities through ecological selection, leading to the establishment of distinctive biodiversity zones. The genera identified in these layers are well-known to activate a wide range of redox reactions at low O-2 conditions. As inferred from 16S rDNA data, the highly diversified and coupled processes sustained by the monimolimnetic microbiota are essential ecosystem services that enhance mineralization of organic matter and formation of reduced compounds, and also abatement of undesirable greenhouse gasses.","2019","10","10.3389/fmicb.2019.02257","me","maybe"

Here, we aim to narrow this gap by comparing the diversity patterns of free-living microbes and macro-invertebrates across a natural experiment provided by the marine lakes of Palau: geographically discrete and environmentally heterogeneous bodies of seawater with comparable geological and climatic history, and a similar regional species pool. We find contrasting patterns of alpha-diversity but remarkably similar patterns of beta-diversity between microbial and macro-invertebrate communities among lakes. Pairwise dissimilarities in community composition among lakes are positively correlated between microbes and macro-invertebrates, and influenced to a similar degree by marked gradients in oxygen concentration and salinity. Our findings indicate that a shared spatio-temporal and environmental context may result in parallel patterns of beta-diversity in microbes and macro-invertebrates, in spite of key trait differences between these organisms. This raises the possibility that parallel processes also influence transitions among regional biota across the tree of life, at least in the marine realm.","2019","286","10.1098/rspb.2019.0999","me","YES"

This study took soil samples from 300 forest plots spanning six forest types along a latitudinal gradient in eastern China, which ranges from tropical rainforest to boreal forest ecosystems. A null-model analysis was used to compare the observed soil fungal beta diversity (beta-diversity) with the beta-diversity expected from random sampling of each local species pool. We also compared the relative importance of environmental and spatial variables on soil fungal beta-diversity among forest types along the latitudinal gradient. Our results found that observed beta-diversity was greater than expected beta-diversity in all six forest types, which means that species tend to be more aggregated than expected. We determined that this species aggregation resulted from both environmental filtering and species dispersal limitations. Further, environmental variables had stronger influences on beta-diversity than spatial dispersions. Additionally, the co-occurrence network showed that more species interactions occurred in the mid-latitude forests which lead to decreased soil fungal beta-diversity and low interpretations of environmental and spatial variables. Study of these processes in different forest types along latitudinal gradients will provide important insights that local differences in the relative importance of different community assembly processes creates different gradients in global biodiversity.","2019","10","10.3390/f10100863","me","YES"

However, only one stygobitic lineage, Speleonerilla nom. nov. (previously known as Longipalpa), seems obligate to this environment. We here provide new information on this lineage including the description of three new species, two new records, and the first phylogeny of the genus. All species have been collected from the water column of anchialine caves in the Caribbean, Bermuda, and Canary Islands, contrary to their benthic and interstitial nerillid relatives. New species were described combining light, scanning electron, and confocal laser scanning microscopy and named after traditional dances from their corresponding countries. Speleonerilla isa sp. n. is morphologically the most divergent species, characterized by the presence of nine segments, two pairs of spermioducts, and parapodial cirri present on all segments. Speleonerilla calypso sp. n. and S. salsa sp. n. are mainly distinguished from S. saltatrix by the presence of one additional pair of nephridia and are diagnosed based on unique combinations of characters including the specific arrangements of trunk ciliation, parapodial cirri, and number of chaetae. Two additional records from anchialine caves in Northeast Cuba and Mexico were not described due to limited available material. Phylogenetic analyses of four molecular markers recovered the East Atlantic S. isa as sister to a clade containing the West Atlantic species, the interrelationship of which did not further reflect the geographical distances within the Caribbean. Evolutionary adaptations are discussed, such as the long ciliated palps and pygidial lobes of Speleonerilla used for swimming and their high tolerance to changing salinities when apparently feeding on bacteria in the halocline of the anchialine cave systems.","2019","49","10.1007/s12526-018-0906-5","me","NO"

The results showed that common and rare taxa had similar patterns in species richness, while rare taxa exhibited a higher turnover, which caused their higher structural dissimilarity. Common species with wider niche breadths were more strongly influenced by deterministic filtering when compared to rare taxa, which occupied narrow niches and were primarily controlled by stochastic processes. Generally, species with wider niche breadths were always more strongly influenced by deterministic selection. The analysis of predicted functions revealed that rare taxa occupied more unique predicted functional traits than common taxa, suggesting that rare taxa played a key role in maintaining the functional diversity.

The growths of red-orange phototrophic biofilms have been widely reported in the literature and have commonly been associated with the order Trentepohliales, whose ecological and taxonomical information needs to be improved. Considering the recurrent presence of such biofilms throughout the Lazio region, we would identify the occurring species and define their favourable environmental conditions, through morphological, genetic and ecological analyses. Results Biofilms were collected across an altitude range of 0 to 860 m asl, occurring from the coast to 60-km inland. A dominant presence of the filamentous terrestrial green alga Trentepohlia umbrina (Kutzing) Bornet was confirmed in all sites sometimes mixed with cyanobacteria of the genus Gloeocapsa. The distribution of Trentepohliales is generally given as pan-tropical, but some species, such as T. umbrina, are also distributed in temperate climates. Here, it is reported for the first time a Mediterranean occurrence of the species. Low humidity and light conditions, such as those occurring on vertical surfaces with mainly northern aspects, are the preferred environmental conditions. Coastal areas were more favourable for its growth, probably due to the higher nocturnal condensation that occurs here. Concrete and mortars were particularly bioreceptive to T. umbrina, but marble and trachyte were also colonised under favourable conditions.

However, the impact of long-term conservation pasture management on soil microbial communities remains unclear. Therefore, soil microbiome responses to conservation pasture management is an important component of soil health, especially in the largest agricultural land-use in the US. The aim of this study was to identify soil microbiome community differences following 13-years of pasture management (hayed (no cattle), continuously grazed, rotationally grazed with a fenced, un-grazed and unfertilized buffer strip, and a control (no poultry litter or cattle manure inputs)). Since 2004, all pastures (excluding the control) received annual poultry litter at a rate of 5.6 Mg ha(-1). Soil samples were collected at a 0-15 cm depth from 2016-017 either pre or post poultry litter applications, and bacterial communities were characterized using Illumina 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Overall, pasture management influenced soil microbial community structure, and effects were different by year (P < 0.05). Soils receiving no poultry litter or cattle manure had the lowest richness (Chao). Continuously grazed systems had greater (P < 0.05) soil community richness, which corresponded with greater soil pH and nutrients. Consequently, continuously grazed systems may increase soil diversity, owing to continuous nutrient-rich manure deposition; however, this management strategy may adversely affect aboveground plant communities and water quality. These results suggest conservation pasture management (e.g., rotationally grazed systems) may not improve microbial diversity, albeit, buffer strips were reduced nutrients and bacterial movement as evident by low diversity and fertility in these areas compared to areas with manure or poultry litter inputs. Overall, animal inputs (litter or manure) increased soil microbiome diversity and may be a mechanism for improved soil health.","2019","7","10.7717/peerj.7839","me","maybe"

The microbiota colonizing the endophytic compartment (endorhizosphere) and the rhizosphere contribute to productivity, plant growth, phytoremediation and carbon sequestration. The main objective of this study was to investigate how fungal communities are enriched in different habitats outside and inside of grapevine roots. For this purpose, the spatial dynamics of the fungal communities associated with three soil-plant compartments (bulk soil, rhizosphere and endorhizosphere) were characterized by ITS high-throughput amplicon sequencing (HTAS). Fungal communities were largely affected in their diversity and composition by soil-plant compartments, whereas the spatial variation (i.e. across five vineyards) was low. The endorhizosphere compartment differed most from the other two, suggesting that the root tissues entail a barrier for fungal colonization. The results of functional prediction via FUNGuild suggested an increase in the relative abundances of potential plant pathogens, endophytes and arbuscular mycorrhiza, and a decrease in wood, dung and undefined saprotrophs from bulk soil towards the endorhizosphere. Roots of asymptomatic vines were a microbial niche that is inhabited by soilborne fungi associated with grapevine trunk diseases, which opens up new perspectives in the study of the endophytic role of these pathogens on grapevines.

Based on data from 1103 genomes of environmental and clinical isolates, we show that V. parahaemolyticus is divided into four diverse populations, VppUS1, VppUS2, VppX and VppAsia. The first two are largely restricted to the US and Northern Europe, while the others are found worldwide, with VppAsia making up the great majority of isolates in the seas around Asia. Patterns of diversity within and between the populations are consistent with them having arisen by progressive divergence via genetic drift during geographical isolation. However, we find that there is substantial overlap in their current distribution. These observations can be reconciled without requiring genetic barriers to exchange between populations if long-range dispersal has increased dramatically in the recent past. We found that VppAsia isolates from the US have an average of 1.01% more shared ancestry with VppUS1 and VppUS2 isolates than VppAsia isolates from Asia itself. Based on time calibrated trees of divergence within epidemic lineages, we estimate that recombination affects about 0.017% of the genome per year, implying that the genetic mixture has taken place within the last few decades. These results suggest that human activity, such as shipping, aquatic products trade and increased human migration between continents, are responsible for the change of distribution pattern of this species.","2019","13","10.1038/s41396-019-0461-5","me","NO"

Evidence from regional scale studies suggests that foliar fungal symbiont distributions are influenced both by plant hosts and environmental variation in climate and soil resources. However, previous surveys have focused on either one plant host across an environmental gradient or one gradient and multiple plant hosts, making it difficult to disentangle the influence of host identity from the influence of the environment on foliar endophyte communities. We used a culture-based approach to survey fungal symbiont composition in the leaves of nine C-3 grass species along replicated elevation gradients in grasslands of the Colorado Rocky Mountains. In these ecosystems, the taxonomic richness and composition of foliar fungal symbionts were mostly structured by the taxonomic identity of the plant host rather than by variation in climate. Plant traits related to size (height and leaf length) were the best predictors of foliar fungal symbiont composition and diversity, and composition did not vary predictably with plant evolutionary history. The largest plants had the most diverse and distinctive fungal communities. These results suggest that across the similar to 300 m elevation range that we sampled, foliar fungal symbionts may indirectly experience climate change by tracking the shifting distributions of plant hosts rather than tracking climate directly.","2019","78","10.1007/s00248-019-01336-4","me","maybe"

Associated microbial communities, in particular, eukaryotes, play significant roles in nutrient fixation and turnover. In order to understand better the ecological processes driven by these organisms, the first step is to characterise these associated organisms. We characterised the taxonomic diversity, and from this, inferred the functional diversity of microeukaryotes in Sphagnum mosses in tropical, subtropical and temperate climatic zones through an environmental DNA diversity metabarcoding survey of the V9 region of the gene coding for the RNA of the small subunit of the ribosomes (SSU rRNA). As microbial processes are strongly driven by temperatures, we hypothesised that saprotrophy would be highest in warm regions, whereas mixotrophy, an optimal strategy in oligotrophic environments, would peak under colder climates. Phylotype richness was higher in tropical and subtropical climatic zones than in the temperate region, mostly due to a higher diversity of animal parasites (i.e. Apicomplexa). Decomposers, and especially opportunistic yeasts and moulds, were more abundant under warmer climates, while mixotrophic organisms were more abundant under temperate climates. The dominance of decomposers, suggesting a higher heterotrophic activity under warmer climates, is coherent with the generally observed faster nutrient cycling at lower latitudes; this phenomenon is likely enhanced by higher inputs of nutrients most probably brought in the system by Metazoa, such as arthropods.","2019","78","10.1007/s00248-019-01325-7","me","maybe"

Yet, despite increasing efforts to characterize soil bacterial and fungal assemblages, it is challenging to disentangle the influences of sampling design on assessments of communities. Here, we sought to determine whether composite samples-often analyzed as a low cost and effort alternative to replicated individual samples-provide representative summary estimates of microbial communities. At three Minnesota agricultural research sites planted with an oat cover crop, we conducted amplicon sequencing for soil bacterial and fungal communities (16S(V4) and ITS2) of replicated individual or homogenized composite soil samples. We compared soil microbiota from within and among plots and then among agricultural sites using both sampling strategies. Results indicated that single or multiple replicated individual samples, or a composite sample from each plot, were sufficient for distinguishing broad site-level macroecological differences among bacterial and fungal communities. Analysis of a single sample per plot captured only a small fraction of the distinct OTUs, diversity, and compositional variability detected in the analysis of multiple individual samples or a single composite sample. Likewise, composite samples captured only a fraction of the diversity represented by the six individual samples from which they were formed, and, on average, analysis of two or three individual samples offered greater compositional coverage (i.e., greater number of OTUs) than a single composite sample. We conclude that sampling design significantly impacts estimates of bacterial and fungal communities even in homogeneously managed agricultural soils, and our findings indicate that while either strategy may be sufficient for broad macroecological investigations, composites may be a poor substitute for replicated samples at finer spatial scales.","2019","78","10.1007/s00248-019-01318-6","me","maybe"

However, our current understanding of the drivers of soil microbial diversity lags our understanding of macroorganisms. Here, we used Illumina sequencing of 16S and ITS rRNA genes to explore which factor(s) controlled soil microbial (i.e., bacteria and fungi) richness and diversity in a 25-ha karst broadleaf forest in Southwest China. Across the plot, all bacterial and fungal richness (number of OTUs) and diversity indices (Shannon diversity and phylogenetic diversity) showed strong spatial autocorrelations. Soil microbial richness and diversity indices displayed a unimodal pattern from south to north in the karst forest, with peaks in the low and middle areas of the plot. Slope was found to be the best predictor of soil bacterial and fungal richness and diversity indices. Soil pH was negatively related with bacterial richness, and with bacterial and fungal phylogenetic diversity. Tree Shannon diversity and density together explained much of the variations in fungal OTUs and diversity indices. Spatial factors explained much less of the variation in soil microbial richness and diversity indices than the selected environmental variables, which indicated that habitat heterogeneity rather than dispersal limitation played an important role in soil microbial richness and diversity in the karst forest. In conclusion, slope was the major driver of the spatial distribution of soil microbial richness and diversity in the karst forest due to its effects on plant (i.e., tree Shannon diversity and tree density) and soil characteristics (i.e., soil pH and available phosphorus).","2019","449","10.1016/j.foreco.2019.03.033","me","YES"

Soil microbial fuel cells (MFCs) can promote the degradation efficiency of contaminants while generating bioelectricity under anaerobic conditions. MFC performance varies amongst different types of soils due to distinctive soil properties. This study assesses the performance of soil MFCs filled with four typical Chinese soils and explores key factors regulating bioelectricity generation and tetracycline degradation. Except for the MFCs filled with black soil, tetracycline degradation rates improved in soil MFCs, particularly in those filled with Chao soil, which enhanced the degradation rate by 39% relative to the corresponding control. Additionally, soil MFCs filled with Chao soil exhibited the highest charge output of 1347 +/- 357C, which was 100-499% higher than that of MFCs with other soils. According to redundancy analysis, soil particle size, pH, conductivity and dissolved organic carbon content showed positive association with tetracycline degradation and charge output, while the adsorption of tetracycline had a negative association with degradation rate. Thus, the adsorption of tetracycline restricted its removal efficiency in soil MFCs, and high soil conductivity and large particle size promoted electron transfer, enhancing biocurrent intensity, which increased tetracycline degradation efficiency.

Currently, for archived soils, there is a concern whether the spatial differences are still preserved in them after long-term storage. Considering plenty of archived soils being stored by institutions, we tried to explore whether they could provide certain information about microbial biogeography. In the present study, high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene was conducted for archived soil samples, which were collected in different years from four agricultural long-term experimental stations of the Chinese Ecosystem Research Network and had been stored for approximate 1, 6 and 11 years. After processing the raw high-throughput sequencing data, a total of 10,623 OTUs belonging to 46 phyla were detected across all 72 soil samples. The results of OTU analysis showed that the overlap ratio (> 57.35%) of bacterial OTUs between sampling years at the same station was higher than that (< 32.39%) between experimental stations in the same year. Simultaneously, the differences in taxonomic counts among stations in the same sampling year overwhelmed those among sampling years at the same station, and a similar result was observed for bacterial alpha-diversity as well. More importantly, soil bacterial communities were distinctly different among geographic locations (ANOSIM R = 0.997 and p < 0.001), while differed far less among sampling years (R = 0.085, p = 0.005). Altogether, the results from this investigation demonstrated that soils archived for about a decade were still applicable in revealing spatial differences in soil bacterial communities, and these differences were hardly obscured by storage time, suggesting the potential of archived soils in studies on microbial geography.","2019","142","10.1016/j.apsoil.2019.05.021","me","YES"

However, the biogeography of microorganisms, especially ciliated protozoa, remains understudied. Here, we analyzed a comprehensive database of marine benthic ciliates found along the coast of China from 1991 to 2018 to examine the geographical patterns in species and trait composition and functional diversity. According to redundancy analysis conducted at large spatial scales, environmental variables, i.e. habitat type and salinity, explained more variance in species composition than latitude. In contrast, trait composition was better explained by spatial and climatic variables. At small spatial scales, both species and trait composition were probably influenced by mass effects due to the high dispersal ability of ciliates at such small scales, resulting in spatially homogenized communities. Several traits, including body size, feeding type and mobility, exhibited significant positive or negative latitudinal gradients. Functional diversity showed a significant positive correlation with latitude between 20 and 40 degrees N, which may be caused by certain groups of ciliates possessing particular traits related to temperature. Our study is the first comprehensive evaluation of how trait composition and functional diversity of marine ciliated protozoa vary at large scales and can thus make a major contribution to the study of microbial biogeography.","2019","627","10.3354/meps13086","me","YES"

Here, an integrative approach, combining high-throughput cDNA sequencing and quantitative protargol stain, was used to analyze ciliate communities collected temporally along a transect from coastal to oceanic regions at depths ranging from the surface to 1000 m. The mesopelagic zone exhibited comparable alpha diversity to surface water which was consistent over temporal variation, with high diversity occurring at the interface with the euphotic zone. Comparison with the northeastern and the western Pacific Ocean revealed consistency of this vertical distribution of ciliates across oceanic basins. Mesopelagic ciliates harbored distinct community structure without significant seasonal differences, with the vertical variations driven largely by members of the classes Spirotrichea and Oligohymenophorea. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) affiliated with Scuticociliatia, Astomatida and Apostomatida, members of which are known to be bacterivorous and/or commensal/parasitic species, were more abundant in mesopelagic waters than above, implying they are an important component of food webs in the mesopelagic zone. A combination of depth, geographic distance and environment shaped the ciliate communities, with depth being the most influential factor. Phylogenetic null modeling analysis further indicated that 57.1 and 33.3% of mesopelagic community variation was governed by dispersal limitation and heterogeneous selection, respectively, probably due to the marked biochemical and physical gradients down the water column. This suggests that ciliate community structure in the mesopelagic zone is mainly controlled by stochastic processes. Collectively, this study reports mesopelagic ciliates exhibited high diversity and distinct community structure across spatiotemporal scales and informs the processes mediating ciliate assembly in the mesopelagic zone. These should be fully considered in future studies to build a more comprehensive understanding of mesopelagic microbial assemblages.","2019","10","10.3389/fmicb.2019.02178","me","maybe"

Methanotrophs represent a widespread and phylogenetically complex guild, yet the biogeography of this functional group and the factors that explain the taxonomic structure of the methanotrophic assemblage are still poorly understood. Here, we used high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene of the bacterial community to study the methanotrophic community composition and the environmental factors that influence their distribution and relative abundance in a wide range of freshwater habitats, including lakes, streams and rivers across the boreal landscape. Within one region, soil and soil water samples were additionally taken from the surrounding watersheds in order to cover the full terrestrial-aquatic continuum. The composition of methanotrophic communities across the boreal landscape showed only a modest degree of regional differentiation but a strong structuring along the hydrologic continuum from soil to lake communities, regardless of regions. This pattern along the hydrologic continuum was mostly explained by a clear niche differentiation between type I and type II methanotrophs along environmental gradients in pH, and methane concentrations. Our results suggest very different roles of type I and type II methanotrophs within inland waters, the latter likely having a terrestrial source and reflecting passive transport and dilution along the aquatic networks, but this is an unresolved issue that requires further investigation.","2019","28","10.1111/mec.15223","me","YES"

Results We investigated the vertical soil microbial community structure in a primary Korean pine-broadleaved mixed forest in Changbai Mountain (from 699 to 1177 m) and analyzed the relationship between the microbial community and both C and N components in the soil. The results showed that the total phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) of soil microbes and Gram-negative bacteria (G-), Gram-positive bacteria (G+), fungi (F), arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), and Actinomycetes varied significantly (p < 0.05) at different sites (elevations). The ratio of fungal PLFAs to bacterial PLFAs (F/B) was higher at site H1, and H2. The relationship between microbial community composition and geographic distance did not show a distance-decay pattern. The coefficients of variation for bacteria were maximum among different sites (elevations). Total soil organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), soil water content (W), and the ratio of breast-height basal area of coniferous trees to that of broad-leaved tree species (RBA) were the main contributors to the variation observed in each subgroup of microbial PLFAs. The structure equation model showed that TOC had a significant direct effect on bacterial biomass and an indirect effect upon bacterial and fungal biomass via soil readily oxidized organic carbon (ROC). No significant relationship was observed between soil N fraction and the biomass of fungi and bacteria. Conclusion The total PLFAs (tPLFA) and PLFAs of soil microbes, including G-, G+, F, AMF, and Actinomycetes, were significantly affected by elevation. Bacteria were more sensitive to changes in elevation than other microbes. Environmental heterogeneity was the main factor affecting the geographical distribution pattern of microbial community structure.

In this study, we aim to identify the efficacy of feces as a gut proxy in birds using chickens as a model. We collected 1,026 samples from 206 chickens, including duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, and feces samples, for 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing analyses. In this study, the efficacy of feces as a gut proxy was partitioned to microbial community membership and community structure. Most taxa in the small intestine (84.11-87.28%) and ceca (99.39%) could be identified in feces. Microbial community membership was reflected with a gut anatomic feature, but community structure was not. Excluding shared microbes, the small intestine and ceca contributed 34.12 and 5.83% of the total fecal members, respectively. The composition of Firmicutes members in the small intestine and that of Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria members in the ceca could be well mirrored by the observations in fecal samples (p = 0.54-0.71 and 0.71-0.78, respectively, P < 0.001). However, there were few significant correlations for each genus between feces and each of the four gut segments, and these correlations were not high (p = -0.2-0.4, P < 0.05) for most genera. Our results suggest that fecal microbial community has a good potential to identify most taxa in the chicken gut and could moderately mirror the microbial structure in the intestine at the microbial population level with phylum specificity.

Abundant-weighted UniFrac metric partitioned bacterial assemblies into two categories (the top community and the base community) by principal coordinates analysis, consisting with the grouping of sampling stations by environmental variables. Differences in depth and physicochemical properties of the surrounding environment (e.g., concentrations of dissolved oxygen and geochemical elements) between the top and the base of the guyot may cause this partition of bacterial communities, whereas the typical fluid flow around the guyot may potentially contribute to the bacterial dispersal and environmental homogeneity along the same layer, resulting in the similarity of bacterial community structure within the same region (the top or the base). The surface sediment on the top of the guyot harbored the bacterial communities with greater diversity and evenness, represented by Gamma- and Deltaproteobacteria involved in sulfur cycling. At the base of the guyot, Gammaproteobacteria related to sulfur-oxidizing and Chloroflexi functioning in the decomposition of refractory organic matter dominated, suggesting that the redox condition at the interface of the sediment and the water can influence bacteria-mediated elemental cycling, eventually shaping the physicochemical and geological characteristics of a guyot.","2019","124","10.1029/2019JG005066","me","YES"

Here we revisit Altig, Whiles, and Taylor (2007)s paper, which highlighted the knowledge gaps in tadpole feeding ecology and the application of modern techniques, such as stable isotope and fatty acid analyses to better quantify dominant food resources, food assimilation, and the trophic status of tadpoles. We reviewed the ecological studies that have been published since 2007 that used stable isotopes and fatty acid analyses, also metagenomics and ecological stoichiometry analyses. We describe the ecological roles of tadpoles in freshwater ecosystems and identify knowledge gaps regarding tadpole feeding ecology across biogeographic regions. Worldwide declines in amphibian abundance and diversity create an urgent need to document their feeding ecology and trophic status. As consumers, tadpoles play important functional roles in nutrient cycling, energy flow, and bioturbation. They also exhibit context-dependent trophic plasticity in response to abiotic and biotic gradients, which complicates understanding of their trophic roles. Most studies of tadpole trophic ecology have been conducted primarily on species from the families Ranidae, Bufonidae, and Hylidae from Neotropic and Nearctic regions, while species in tropical regions such as Africa and Asia lack ecological information for tadpoles. There continues to be a need for studies of tadpole diets and/or trophic ecology in Africa and Southeast Asia regions where species endemism is threated by the growth of anthropogenic activities. The majority of studies have focused on trophic ecology of tadpoles from the perspective of single species or at relatively small spatial and temporal scales.

Despite the ecological significance of bacterial communities, the integrated biogeography of planktonic and sedimentary bacterial communities in response to anthropogenic activities is not adequately understood. Here, we examined environmental parameters and the composition of planktonic and sedimentary bacteria in the Yulin River, a tributary of Three Gorges Reservoir, in response to changes in land use and dam construction. The results revealed that human-induced land use changes enhanced the nutrient concentrations in surface water and dam construction reduced the content of carbon and nitrogen in immediately downstream sediments. Intensified human-dominated land use showed a slight impact on sedimentary bacterial communities but largely reduced the diversity of planktonic bacterial communities. Moreover. human-induced land use changes increased the abundance of genes associated with denitrification, nitrification, and anammox in planktonic bacterial communities by 19.04%, 32.40% and 30.45%, respectively. In dam construction regions, the diversity and nutrient-related metabolic activity of sedimentary bacterial communities immediately downstream of the dam were decreased, whereas these changes were not observed in planktonic bacterial communities. Additionally, bacterial community composition was significantly related to nutrient concentrations variability and followed a distance-decay pattern. Furthermore, environmental effects explained more of the variation in planktonic bacterial community composition as compared with spatial effects did, whereas, sedimentary bacterial communities were more closely related to spatial effects.

The A pathotype has a broad host spectrum, while A* and A(w) are more restricted both in hosts and in geography. Two previous phylogenomic studies led to contrasting well-supported clades for sequenced genomes of these pathotypes. No extensive biogeographical or divergence dating analytic approaches have been so far applied to available genomes. Results Based on a larger sampling of genomes than in previous studies (including six new genomes sequenced by our group, adding to a total of 95 genomes), phylogenomic analyses resulted in different resolutions, though overall indicating that A + A(W) is the most likely true clade. Our results suggest the high degree of recombination at some branches and the fast diversification of lineages are probable causes for this phylogenetic blurring effect. One of the genomes analyzed, X. campestris pv. durantae, was shown to be an A* strain; this strain has been reported to infect a plant of the family Verbenaceae, though there are no reports of any X. citri subsp. citri pathotypes infecting any plant outside the Citrus genus. Host reconstruction indicated the pathotype ancestor likely had plant hosts in the family Fabaceae, implying an ancient jump to the current Rutaceae hosts. Extensive dating analyses indicated that the origin of X. citri subsp. citri occurred more recently than the main phylogenetic splits of Citrus plants, suggesting dispersion rather than host-directed vicariance as the main driver of geographic expansion.

While the relationships between biological community structures and ecological functions are a central issue in ecological theory, these relationships remain poorly understood at the large scale. We selected nine forests along the North-South Transect of Eastern China (NSTEC) to determine how plant functional traits influence the latitudinal pattern of soil microbial functions and how soil microbial communities and functions are linked at the regional scale. We found that there was considerable latitudinal variation in the profiles of different substrate use along the NSTEC. Specifically, we found that the substrate use by microorganisms was highest in the temperate forest soils (soil microbial substrate use intensities of 10-12), followed by the subtropical forest soils (soil microbial substrate use intensities of 7-10), and was least in the coniferous forest soils (soil microbial substrate use intensities of 4-7). The latitudinal variation in soil microbial function was more closely related to plant functional traits (leaf dry matter content, leaf C concentrations, and leaf N concentrations, P = 0.002) than climate (mean annual precipitation, P = 0.022). The soil silt, leaf dry matter, and leaf C and N contents were the main controls on the biogeographical patterns of microbial substrate use in these forest soils. The soil microbial community structures and functions were significantly correlated along the NSTEC. Soil carbohydrate and polymer substrate use were mainly related to soil Gram-positive (G(+)) bacterial and actinomycic phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs), while the use of amine and miscellaneous substrates were related to soil Gram-negative (G(-)) bacterial and fungal PLFAs. The enzyme production varied with changes in the soil microbial communities. The soil enzyme activities were positively correlated with the bacterial PLFAs but were not correlated with the fungal PLFAs. The soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition rates were significantly higher in the temperate forests than in the subtropical and tropical forests, emphasizing the rapid degradability of high-energy substrates such as soil microbial biomass carbon, carbohydrates, and amino acids. The SOM decomposition rates were significantly and negatively related to soil dissolved organic carbon concentrations, carboxylic acids, polymers, and miscellaneous substrate use. The relationships between soil PLFAs and microbial substrate use, enzyme activities, and SOM decomposition rate show that as the soil microbial community structure changes, soil biogeochemical processes also change.","2019","16","10.5194/bg-16-3333-2019","me","maybe"

Their extensive diversity challenges emerging operational boundaries defined for microbial species  and complicates efforts of population genetics to study their evolution. Here, we employed single-amino acid variants (SAAVs) to investigate ecological and evolutionary forces that maintain the genomic heterogeneity within ubiquitous SAR11 populations we accessed through metagenomic read recruitment using a single isolate genome. Integrating amino acid and protein biochemistry with metagenomics revealed that systematic purifying selection against deleterious variants governs non-synonymous variation among very closely related populations of SAR11. SAAVs partitioned metagenomes into two main groups matching large-scale oceanic current temperatures, and six finer proteotypes that connect distant oceanic regions. These findings suggest that environmentally-mediated selection plays a critical role in the journey of cosmopolitan surface ocean microbial populations, and the idea everything is everywhere but the environment selects has credence even at the finest resolutions.","2019","8","10.7554/eLife.46497","me","maybe"

However, most research has focused on the topsoil, while the subsoil is assumed to have microbial diversity patterns similar to those of the topsoil. Here we compared patterns and drivers of microbial alpha and beta diversity in and between topsoils (0 to 10 cm) and subsoils (30 to 50 cm) of temperate grasslands in Inner Mongolia of China, covering an similar to 1,500-km transect along an aridity gradient. Counter to the conventional assumption, we find contrasting biogeographic patterns of diversity and influencing factors for different bacterial and archaeal groups and between depths. While bacterial diversity remains constant or increases with increasing aridity in topsoil and decreases in subsoil, archaeal diversity decreases in topsoil and remains constant in subsoil. Microbial diversity in the topsoil is most strongly influenced by aboveground vegetation and contemporary climate but is most strongly influenced by the factor historical temperature anomaly since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and by soil pH in the subsoil. Moreover, the biogeographic patterns of topsoil-subsoil community dissimilarities vary for different microbial groups and are overall most strongly influenced by soil fertility differences between depths for bacteria and by contemporary climate for archaea. These findings suggest that diversity patterns observed in the topsoil may not be readily applied to the subsoil horizons. For the subsoil in particular, historical climate plays a vital role in the spatial variation of bacterial diversity. Overall, our study provides novel information for understanding and predicting soil microbial diversity patterns at depth. IMPORTANCE Exploring the biogeographic patterns of soil microbial diversity is critical for understanding mechanisms underlying the response of soil processes to climate change. Using top- and subsoils from an similar to 1,500-km temperate grassland transect, we find divergent patterns of microbial diversity and its determinants in the topsoil versus the subsoil. Furthermore, we find important and direct legacy effects of historical climate change on the microbial diversity of subsoil yet indirect effects on topsoil. Our findings challenge the conventional assumption of similar geographic patterns of soil microbial diversity along soil profiles and help to improve our understanding of how soil microbial communities may respond to future climate change in different regions with various climate histories.","2019","4","10.1128/mSystems.00566-19","me","YES"

Mangroves lie in special locations connecting coastal and estuarine areas and experience fluctuating conditions, which are expected to intensify with climate change, creating a need to better understand the relative roles of stochastic and deterministic processes in shaping microbial community assembly. Here, a study of microbial communities inhabiting mangrove sediments across southeastern China, spanning mangroves in six nature reserves, was conducted. We performed high-throughput DNA sequencing of these samples and compared them with data of 1,370 sediment samples collected from the Earth Microbiome Project (EMP) to compare the microbial diversity of mangroves with that of other biomes. Our results showed that prokaryotic alpha diversity in mangroves was significantly higher than that in other biomes and that microbial beta diversity generally clustered according to biome types. The core operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in mangroves were mostly assigned to Gammaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Euryarchaeota. The majority of beta nearesttaxon index values were higher than 2, indicating that community assembly in mangroves was better explained through a deterministic process than through a stochastic process. Mean annual precipitation (MAP) and total organic carbon (TOC) were main deterministic factors explaining variation in the microbial community. This study fills a gap in addressing the unique microbial diversity of mangrove ecosystems and their microbial community assembly mechanisms. IMPORTANCE Understanding the underlying mechanisms of microbial community assembly patterns is a vital issue in microbial ecology. Mangroves, as an important and special ecosystem, provide a unique environment for examining the relative importance of stochastic and deterministic processes. We made the first global-scale comparison and found that microbial diversity was significantly different in mangrove sediments compared to that of other biomes.

We quantified the impact of spatial and environmental factors on bacterial community structure using variation partitioning analysis, illustrating a nonrandom distribution across the region. pH was confirmed as the key environmental driver structuring Arctic soil bacterial communities, while total organic carbon (TOC), moisture and conductivity were shown to have little effect. Specialist taxa were more abundant in acidic and alkaline soils while generalist taxa were more abundant in acidoneutral soils. Of the 48 147 bacterial taxa, a core microbiome composed of only 13 taxa that were ubiquitously distributed and present within 95% of samples was identified, illustrating the high potential for endemism in the region.

Fungi play major roles in ecosystem processes, but the determinants of fungal diversity and biogeographical patterns in saline agricultural systems remain poorly understood. Here we performed Illumina MiSeq high throughput sequencing of the fungal ITS1 region from 31 soils covering representative saline agricultural lands in northwest China. The results showed that Dothideomycetes, Eurotiomycetes and Sordariomycetes were the dominant taxonomic groups across all soil samples (>5% of all sequences), while saprotroph, pathotroph-saprotroph-symbiotroph and pathotroph were the main functional guilds across all soil samples. Interestingly, the fungal abundance and alpha diversity increased with increasing longitudinal gradient from 84 degrees 13 E to 89 degrees 11 E. Soil moisture, followed by salinity and total potassium, were the primary environmental drivers of the fungal community; these soil parameters were significantly (P < 0.05) correlated with longitude, and therefore potentially result in longitudinal fungal gradients. Furthermore, the fungal community assembly was mainly stochastic; fungal community exhibited distance-decay distribution patterns, which were mainly influenced by geographical distance. By contrast, environmental factors (such as salinity pH, soil moisture, or nutrients) mainly contributed to the variation in trophic guilds. These findings enhance our understanding of fungal biogeography in saline agricultural soils.","2019","83","10.2136/sssaj2019.03.0082","me","YES"

We tracked relationships between the soil microbiome and the human intestinal microbiome. We propose a novel environmental microbiome hypothesis, which implies that a close linkage between the soil microbiome and the human intestinal microbiome has evolved during evolution and is still developing. From hunter-gatherers to an urbanized society, the human gut has lost alpha diversity. Interestingly, beta diversity has increased, meaning that people in urban areas have more differentiated individual microbiomes. On top of little contact with soil and feces, hygienic measures, antibiotics and a low fiber diet of processed food have led to a loss of beneficial microbes. At the same time, loss of soil biodiversity is observed in many rural areas. The increasing use of agrochemicals, low plant biodiversity and rigorous soil management practices have a negative effect on the biodiversity of crop epiphytes and endophytes. These developments concur with an increase in lifestyle diseases related to the human intestinal microbiome. We point out the interference with the microbial cycle of urban human environments versus pre-industrial rural environments. In order to correct these interferences, it may be useful to adopt a different perspective and to consider the human intestinal microbiome as well as the soil/root microbiome as superorganisms which, by close contact, replenish each other with inoculants, genes and growth-sustaining molecules.","2019","7","10.3390/microorganisms7090287","me","NO"

HTS-based characterization of metabolically active (RNA-derived) and total (DNA-derived) fungal communities in different terrestrial habitats has revealed profound differences in both richness and community compositions. However, such DNA- and RNA-based HTS comparisons are widely missing for fungal communities of groundwater aquifers in the terrestrial biogeosphere. Therefore, in this study, we extracted DNA and RNA from groundwater samples of two pristine aquifers in the Hainich CZE and employed paired-end Illumina sequencing of the fungal nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) region to comprehensively test difference/similarities in the total and active fungal communities. We found no significant differences in the species richness between the DNA- and RNA-derived fungal communities, but the relative abundances of various fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) appeared to differ. We also found the same set of environmental parameters to shape the total and active fungal communities in the targeted aquifers. Furthermore, our comparison also underlined that about 30%-40% of the fungal OTUs were only detected in RNA-derived communities. This implies that the active fungal communities analyzed by HTS methods in the subsurface aquifers are actually not a subset of supposedly total fungal communities.

However, few studies have attempted to interpret the microbial distance-decay pattern from the perspective of quantifying underlying processes. In this study, we examined the processes governing bacterial community assembly at multiple spatial scales in maize fields of Northeast China using Illumina MiSeq sequencing. Results showed that the processes governing spatial turnover in bacterial community composition shifted regularly with spatial scale, with homogenizing dispersal dominating at small spatial scales and variable selection dominating at larger scales, which in turn explained the distance-decay pattern that closer located sites tended to have higher community similarity. Together, homogenizing dispersal and dispersal limitation resulting from geographic factors governed about 33% of spatial turnover in bacterial community composition. Deterministic selection processes had the strongest influence, at 57%, with biotic factors and abiotic environmental filtering (mainly imposed by soil pH) respectively contributing about 37% and 63% of variation. Our results provided a novel and comprehensive way to explain the distance-decay pattern of soil microbiome via quantifying the assembly processes at multiple spatial scales, as well as the method to quantify the influence of abiotic, biotic, and geographic factors in shaping microbial community structure, thus enabling understanding of widely acknowledged microbial biogeographic patterns and microbial ecology.","2019","8","10.1002/mbo3.851","me","YES"

A Comprehensive Review","CUREUS","Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is the autoimmune-mediated destruction of platelets. ITP is a diagnosis of exclusion after other identifiable etiologies have been ruled out. After the first report by Gasbarrini et al. (1998) showing rising platelet counts in ITP patients following Helicobacter pylori (HP) eradication therapy, there is growing evidence that highlights the role of HP in triggering ITP. However, the exact pathophysiology of HP-associated ITP is still unclear, but many theories have been implicated in this regard. According to various reports, the postulated mechanisms for the role of HP in cITP include molecular mimicry, increased plasmacytoid dendritic cell numbers, phagocytic perturbation, and variable host immune response to HP virulence factors. One famous theory suggested molecular mimicry between platelet surface antigen and bacterial virulence factor, i.e. cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA). It is thought that a chronic inflammatory response following an HP infection induces the host autoantibodies response against CagA, which cross-reacts with platelet surface glycoproteins; therefore, it may accelerate platelet destruction in the host reticuloendothelial system. However, further studies are mandated to better understand the causal link between ITP and HP and study the role of biogeography. Nowadays, it is recommended that every patient with ITP should undergo HP diagnostic testing and triple therapy should be administered in all those candidates who test positive for HP infection. In our review, there were a few pregnant female ITP patients who took HP eradication therapy mainly after 20 weeks of gestation without maternal or fetal worst outcomes. However, large-scale studies are advisable to study the adverse fetal outcomes following triple therapy use.","2019","11","10.7759/cureus.5551","me","NO"
"Ma, ZS","A new DTAR (diversity-time-area relationship) model demonstrated with the indoor microbiome","JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY","Aim The spatio-temporal distribution of biodiversity is a core field of biogeography, and the so-termed species-time-area relationship (STAR), together with its siblings, that is the SAR (species-area relationship) and STR (species-time relationship), has achieved the rare status of classic laws in ecology and biogeography. Traditionally, the STAR or its recent generalization DTAR (diversity-time-area relationship) has been described with the bivariate power law (BPL) model or more recently with Whittaker, Triantis, and Ladle (2008, Journal of Biography; 35: 18) general dynamic model (GDM). We propose to extend the classic BPL into a more flexible DTAR model, which offers new quantitative methods for estimating maximal global diversity and charactering the relationship between local and regional diversity. Location Indoor microbiome. Taxon Microbes. Method We revise the BPL model by introducing two taper-off (cut-off) parameters or BPLEC (bivariate power law with exponential cutoffs) model, which eventually overwhelms the unsaturated increase of diversity over time and/or space and consequently can offer more realistic modelling of the joint spatio-temporal distribution of biodiversity. Based on the BPLEC model, we further define three new concepts for DTAR: maximal accrual diversity (MAD) profile, local-to-regional diversity (LRD) ratio profile and local-to-global diversity (LGD) ratio profile. Results We introduce and demonstrate the new BPLEC model with the indoor microbiome datasets (Lax et al., 2014, Science; 345: 1048-1052). The new model fitted to the microbiome datasets equally well or slightly better than existing BPL and GDM models, but it possesses two advantages stated below. Main conclusion First, the new BPLEC model overcomes the unlimited diversity accrual in temporal and/or spatial dimensions and hence offers more realistic modelling to the DTAR. Second, the MAD and LRD/LGD offer useful methods for estimating the dark or potential diversity, which accounts for the species locally absent but present in a habitat-specific regional species pool.","2019","46","10.1111/jbi.13636","me","NO"

Land-use intensification drives changes in microbial communities and the soil functions they regulate, but the mechanisms underlying these changes are poorly understood as land use can affect soil communities both directly (e.g. via changes in soil fertility) and indirectly (e.g. via changes in plant inputs). 2. The speed of microbial responses is also poorly understood. For instance, whether it is long-term legacies or short-term changes in land-use intensity that drive changes in microbial communities. 3. To address these topics, we measured multiple microbial functions, bacterial and fungal biomass and abiotic soil properties at two time intervals 3 years apart. This was performed in 150 grassland sites differing greatly in management intensity across three German regions. 4. Observed changes in microbial soil properties were related to both long-term means and short-term changes in: abiotic soil properties, land-use intensity, community abundance-weighted means of plant functional traits and plant biomass properties in regression and structural equation models. Plant traits, particularly leaf phosphorus, and soil pH were the best predictors of change in soil microbial function, as well as fungal and bacterial biomass, while land-use intensity showed weaker effects. 5. Indirect legacy effects, in which microbial change was explained by the effects of long-term land-use intensity on plant traits, were important, thus indicating a time lag between plant community and microbial change. Whenever the effects of short-term changes in land-use intensity were present, they acted directly on soil microorganisms. 6. Synthesis. The results provide new evidence that soil communities and their functioning respond to short-term changes in land-use intensity, but that both rapid and longer time-scale responses to changes in plant functional traits are at least of equal importance. This suggests that management which shapes plant communities may be an effective means of managing soil communities and the functions and services they provide.","2019","107","10.1111/1365-2745.13182","me","maybe"

Moniliophthora spp. species are endemic from South America and infect Americas cocoa crops. Objetive. The objective of the study was to analyze the potential distribution and the fundamental niche of Moniliophthora roreri (Mr) and M. perniciosa (Mp) in America and Africa. Materials and methods. The occurrence records were obtained from a bibliographic review. Bioclimatic variables were used as predictors in the maximum entropy niche model (MaxEnt) and for its visualization in Niche Analyst 3.0. Results. The areas where Mr was most likely to occur were Esmeraldas and Los Rios, Ecuador, coastal zones of Costa Rica, Santander and Antioquia of Colombia, and for Mp the States of Bahia and Acre of Brazil. The variables that most influenced the distribution of Mr are those associated with precipitation. Temperature-related conditions were more important in the Mp model. The risk of Mr invasion was identified in the Acre and Para regions, Brazil. The transfer of the models evidenced the potential of Mr and Mp invasion in cocoa crops in Africa. The fundamental niche of pathogens and cocoa showed average similarity values, while the niche of fungal species showed a low similarity. Low pathogen niche similarity and differences in bioclimatic variables affecting pathogens distribution were related to a process of niche partitioning. Conclusion. Geographical regions with a greater potential distribution of pathogens and bioclimatic characteristics that would favor their probability of presence in Americas cocoa crops were identified. It is necessary to regulate the transport of contaminated plant material and equipment between regions to avoid the introduction of pathogens in healthy cocoa crops.","2019","30","10.15517/am.v30i3.35038","me","NO"

We used 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to determine the bacterial community structure of the suspensions and the soils. When the different diluted suspensions were used to inoculate their native soils, the regrown soil bacterial communities clustered together; by contrast, the communities were separated when the same suspensions were used to inoculate soils other than their native soils. The diversity indices of the suspensions decreased significantly upon dilution. The strength of selection of bacterial communities by soil was stronger for the 10(-1) diluted soil samples than for the 10(-9) diluted soil samples.

Members of this group have been associated with human and other animal diseases, including the nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), which are of growing relevance to public health worldwide. Although soils are often considered an important source of environmentally acquired NTM infections, the biodiversity and ecological preferences of soil mycobacteria remain largely unexplored across contrasting climates and ecosystem types. Using a culture-independent approach by combining 16S rRNA marker gene sequencing with mycobacterium-specific hsp65 gene sequencing, we analyzed the diversity, distributions, and environmental preferences of soil-dwelling mycobacteria in 143 soil samples collected from a broad range of ecosystem types. The surveyed soils harbored highly diverse mycobacterial communities that span the full extent of the known mycobacterial phylogeny, with most soil mycobacteria (97% of mycobacterial clades) belonging to previously undescribed lineages. While mycobacteria tended to have higher relative abundances in cool, wet, and acidic soil environments, several individual mycobacterial clades had contrasting environmental preferences. We identified the environmental preferences of many mycobacterial clades, including the clinically relevant Mycobacterium avium complex that was more commonly detected in wet and acidic soils. However, most of the soil mycobacteria detected were not closely related to known pathogens, calling into question previous assumptions about the general importance of soil as a source of NTM infections. Together, this work provides novel insights into the diversity, distributions, and ecological preferences of soil mycobacteria and lays the foundation for future efforts to link mycobacterial phenotypes to their distributions. IMPORTANCE Mycobacteria are common inhabitants of soil, and while most members of this bacterial group are innocuous, some mycobacteria can cause environmentally acquired infections of humans and other animals. Human infections from nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are increasingly prevalent worldwide, and some areas appear to be hotspots for NTM disease. While exposure to soil is frequently implicated as an important mode of NTM transmission, the diversity, distributions, and ecological preferences of soil mycobacteria remain poorly understood. We analyzed 143 soils from a range of ecosystems and found that mycobacteria and lineages within the group often exhibited predictable preferences for specific environmental conditions. Soils harbor large amounts of previously undescribed mycobacterial diversity, and lineages that include known pathogens were rarely detected in soil. Together, these findings suggest that soil is an unlikely source of many mycobacterial infections. The biogeographical patterns we documented lend insight into the ecology of this important group of soil-dwelling bacteria.","2019","85","10.1128/AEM.01180-19","me","maybe"

PERMANOVA analysis of the microbial community composition revealed significant differences among different patios in their structure at every fermentation stage. In contrast, SIMPER analyses showed that, as fermentation progressed, the overall dissimilarities among patios were reduced. Discriminant species were identified for each fermentation stage. Among these, L. pentosus and P. parvulus were eu-constant species, while L. collinides/paracollinoides and Marinilactibacillus psychrotolerans group were constant species that could be considered microbial key taxa based on the occurrence stability index. The characteristic and, presumably, well adapted microbiota associated to the Spanish-style olive fermentations at the specific geographic area described here is a valuable natural resource which should be preserved conveniently. To our knowledge, this is the first study on the microbial biogeography of table olive fermentations, both at the species and strain levels.","2019","82","10.1016/j.fm.2019.02.004","me","YES"

Interrogating crustal life is difficult due to habitat inaccessibility, low-biomass and contamination challenges. Subseafloor observatories have facilitated the study of planktonic life in crustal aquifers, however, studies of life in crust-attached biofilms are rare. Here, we investigate biofilms grown on various minerals at different temperatures over 1-6 years at subseafloor observatories in the Eastern Pacific. To mitigate potential sequence contamination, we developed a new bioinformatics tool - TaxonSluice. We explore ecological factors driving community structure and potential function of biofilms by comparing our sequence data to previous amplicon and metagenomic surveys of this habitat. We reveal that biofilm community structure is driven by temperature rather than minerology, and that rare planktonic lineages colonize the crustal biofilms. Based on 16S rRNA gene overlap, we partition metagenome assembled genomes into planktonic and biofilm fractions and suggest that there are functional differences between these community types, emphasizing the need to separately examine each to accurately describe subseafloor microbe-rock-fluid processes. Lastly, we report that some rare lineages present in our warm and anoxic study site are also found in cold and oxic crustal fluids in the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, suggesting global crustal biogeography patterns.","2019","10","10.3389/fmicb.2019.01983","me","maybe"

However, these studies mainly focused on a few sites. Here, we studied the near-surface (0-30 cm) soil microbial communities of 35 soil samples collected from most of the areas of the Qaidam Basin, which is the largest basin on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. A total of 32 phyla and 838 genera were detected from all the samples, in which Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Acidobacteria were the most dominant and cosmopolitan phyla. The most abundant phyla (relative abundance > 5%) detected in all 35 soil samples were also the most dominant, which could be explained by their great dispersal ability. The microbial community structures correlated strongly with variations in pH and Mg2+ and were distinct between the high Mg2+ content (>20 g/kg) samples and other samples (Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Chloroflexi were significantly less abundant in the high Mg2+ content group, but the abundance of Firmicutes was significantly greater). Finally, the microbial spatial pattern was influenced by both the local environment and spatial distance, but environmental factors were the primary drivers of microbial spatial patterns in the Qaidam Basin.","2019","8","10.1002/mbo3.909","me","YES"

Despite the crucial ecological role of bacteria, our understanding of their large-scale biogeography patterns across longitude (east-west transect), and the processes that determine these patterns lags significantly behind that of macro-organisms. Here, we used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to evaluate the geographic distributions of bacterial diversity and their driving factors across different longitude sites along an 800-km east-west transect in the Loess Plateau. Twenty-four phyla were detected across all soil samples and the most sequence-abundant bacterial phyla were Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Chloroflexi and Gemmatimonadetes (average relative abundance >5%). Soil bacterial a-diversity, expressed by the richness of soil bacterial communities and Shannon diversity, differed among climates (MAP) but showed strong correlations with MAP (r = -0.537 and r = -0.42, respectively: p < 0.05 in both bacterial diversity indices). Variation partition analysis demonstrated that the bacterial community structure was closely correlated with environmental variables and geographic distance, which together explained 62% of the community variation. Soil properties contributed more to bacterial community variation than the combined geographic distance (historical contingencies) and climate factors. Among all environmental factors, soil pH exhibited a dominant role in structuring bacterial communities in this arid area. Our findings provide new evidence of bacterial biogeography patterns in an arid area (MAP ranged from 473 mm to 547 mm). Additionally, the results indicated a close linkage among soil bacterial community, climate and edaphic variables, which is critical for predicting promoting sustainable ecosystem services in the Loess Plateau.

However, information on the role of viruses in such ecosystems and their interactions with prokaryotic hosts is very limited. Here, we investigated activities of benthic viruses and prokaryotes and their interactions in three hadal trenches (Japan, Izu-Ogasawara and Mariana trenches) and in their nearby abyssal sites. Our findings reveal that these hadal trenches, compared with the surrounding abyssal sites, support higher abundances and biomasses of prokaryotes. In addition, the high prokaryotic biomasses of hadal trenches could favor high rates of viral infection and cell lysis, especially in the Japan Trench. Hadal viruses can release large amounts of highly labile and promptly available organic material by inducing cell lysis, which could contribute to sustain benthic prokaryotes and decrease their dependency on the enzymatic digestion of the more refractory fraction of sediment organic matter. Our results suggest that this process can contribute to explain the discrepancy between high prokaryote biomass and apparent low efficiency in the utilization of the sedimentary organic matter in the hadal ecosystems. Concluding, hadal trenches may be characterized by a highly dynamic viral component, which can boost prokaryotic biomass production, thereby profoundly influencing the functioning of these remote and extreme ecosystems.","2019","10","10.3389/fmicb.2019.01952","me","NO"

These profiles are used as features for city classification in a machine learning algorithm that allows the extraction of the most relevant features for the classification. Conclusions We demonstrate here that the use of functional profiles not only predict accurately the most likely origin of a sample but also to provide an interesting functional point of view of the biogeography of the microbiota.

The size, species composition, and biogeography of microbial communities is shaped by host interactions, and, in turn, the microbiota influences many aspects of human health. Here we discuss the concept of microbiota-nourishing immunity, a host-microbe chimera composed of the microbiota and host factors that shape the microbial ecosystem, which functions in conferring colonization resistance against pathogens. We propose that dysbiosis is a biomarker of a weakening in microbiota-nourishing immunity and that homeostasis can be defined as a state of immune competence. Microbiota-nourishing immunity thus provides a conceptual framework to further examine the mechanisms that preserve a healthy microbiome and the drivers and consequences of dysbiosis.","2019","51","10.1016/j.immuni.2019.08.003","me","NO"

We employ multivariate general additive modeling of recent global soil bacterial datasets to elucidate dependencies of bacterial richness on key soil and climatic attributes. Although results support the well-known association between bacterial richness and soil pH, a hierarchy of novel covariates offers surprising new insights. Defining climatic soil water content explains both, the extent and connectivity of aqueous micro-habitats for bacterial diversity and soil pH, thus providing a better causal attribution. Results show that globally rare and abundant soil bacterial phylotypes exhibit different levels of dependency on environmental attributes.

"Soininen, J; Teittinen, A","Fifteen important questions in the spatial ecology of diatoms","FRESHWATER BIOLOGY","Recently, studies about the spatial distribution of microbial species and communities have increased substantially. Freshwater diatoms are used as one of the most popular model taxa in such macroecological studies, but the most exciting patterns in the spatial ecology of diatoms have not been reviewed. Here, we identify 15 important questions about freshwater diatom ecology, review the major findings, and suggest novel research avenues. We found that diatoms do not support classical latitudinal diversity gradient, species-area relationship or Rapoports rule. We found some, albeit inconsistent support for an elevational diversity gradient, Bergmanns rule and niche conservation. Diatoms do support a positive interspecific abundance-occupancy relationship like nearly all other taxa. With regards to metacommunity dynamics, diatom communities are typically structured by species sorting, but neutral dynamics or mass effects are also evident at large or small spatial scale, respectively. Taken together, this review suggests that diatoms follow some classical biogeographical patterns similarly to larger taxa, but patterns are typically weaker than for macro-organisms. This may result because diatoms are typically relatively strongly controlled by local factors and often exhibit efficient stochastic dispersal processes both at small and large scales. More research is needed to build a more comprehensive view of diatom species-area relationships and latitudinal gradients in diversity, for example. In the future, well-replicated macroecological field experiments, diatom studies with intercontinental or global coverage, trait-based approaches, and DNA-based species identification would be fruitful avenues to shed more light into the spatial ecology of diatoms.","2019","64","10.1111/fwb.13384","me","NO"

Although these changes should affect bacterioplankton community composition (BCC), little is known about which factors drive spatial and temporal patterns of bacterioplankton in these Amazonian floodplains. We used high-throughput sequencing (Illumina MiSeq) of the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene to investigate spatial and temporal patterns of BCC of two size fractions, and their correlation with environmental variables in an Amazon floodplain lake (Lago Grande do Curuai). We found a high degree of novelty in bacterioplankton, as more than half of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) could not be classified at genus level. Spatial habitat heterogeneity and the flood pulse were the main factors shaping free-living (FL) BCC. The gradient of organic matter from transition zone lake -Amazon River was the main driver for particle-attached (PA) BCC. The BCC reflected the complexity of the system, with more variation in space than in time, although both factors were important drivers of the BCC in this Amazon floodplain system.","2019","14","10.1371/journal.pone.0220695","me","YES"

Although the V4 hypervariable fragment of the SSU rDNA gene is widely used as a first-step barcode marker for microbial HTS analyses, it has provided inconclusive results based on the dataset investigated. However, the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2-5rDNA and COI mtDNA fragments indicate the possibility of the delimitation of the cryptic species of P. jenningsi (which is crucial from the point of view of metabarcoding surveys).

However, there is a lack of data at large spatial scales, on the biodiversity of soil microorganisms; national or more extensive studies to date have typically consisted of low replication of haphazardly collected samples. This has led to large spatial gaps in soil microbial biodiversity data. Using a pre-existing dataset of bacterial community composition across a 16-km regular sampling grid in France, we show that the number of detected OTUs changes little under different sampling designs (grid, random, or representative), but increases with the number of samples collected. All common OTUs present in the full dataset were detected when analyzing just 4% of the samples, yet the number of rare OTUs increased exponentially with sampling effort. We show that far more intensive sampling, across all global biomes, is required to detect the biodiversity of soil microorganisms. We propose avenues such as citizen science to ensure these large sample datasets can be more realistically achieved. Furthermore, we argue that taking advantage of pre-existing resources and programs, utilizing current technologies efficiently and considering the potential of future technologies will ensure better outcomes from large and extensive sample surveys. Overall, decreasing the spatial gaps in global soil microbial diversity data will increase our understanding on what governs the distribution of soil taxa, and how these distributions, and therefore their ecosystem contributions, will continue to change into the future.","2019","10","10.3389/fmicb.2019.01820","me","maybe"

Lichens comprise one particularly diverse group of organisms in the park. In this study, we review data from our 11 years of lichenological research in Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Based on approximately 6,000 new field collections generated, the park checklist now includes 920 species, a 129% increase over estimatesmade two decades ago. Nearly a quarter of the lichens reported in the park are known from only a single occurence whereas only 7% of the lichens are known from 20 or more occurences.

The diversity of alpine stream biota is largely reflective of environmental heterogeneity stemming from varying hydrological sources. Globally, alpine stream diversity is under threat as meltwater sources recede and stream conditions become increasingly homogeneous. Much attention has been devoted to macroinvertebrate diversity in alpine headwaters, yet to fully understand the breadth of climate change threats, a more thorough accounting of microbial diversity is needed. We characterized microbial diversity (specifically Bacteria and Archaea) of 13 streams in two disjunct Rocky Mountain subranges through 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Our study encompassed the spectrum of alpine stream sources (glaciers, snowfields, subterranean ice, and groundwater) and three microhabitats (ice, biofilms, and streamwater). We observed no difference in regional (.) diversity between subranges but substantial differences in diversity among (beta) stream types and microhabitats. Within-stream (a) diversity was highest in groundwater-fed springs, lowest in glacierfed streams, and positively correlated with water temperature for both streamwater and biofilm assemblages. We identified an underappreciated alpine stream type-the icy seep-that are fed by subterranean ice, exhibit cold temperatures (summer mean <2 degrees C), moderate bed stability, and relatively high conductivity. Icy seeps will likely be important for combatting biodiversity losses as they contain similar microbial assemblages to streams fed by surface ice yet may be buffered against climate change by insulating debris cover. Our results show that the patterns of microbial diversity support an ominous trend for alpine stream biodiversity; as meltwater sources decline, stream communities will become more diverse locally, but regional diversity will be lost. Icy seeps, however, represent a source of optimism for the future of biodiversity in these imperiled ecosystems.","2019","25","10.1111/gcb.14683","me","maybe"

Much of these efforts focus on taxonomic variation of microbiota within or between animal populations, but rarely test the proportional impacts of ecological components that may affect animal-associated microbiota. Using larvae from the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis from the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, we test the hypothesis that, under natural conditions, inter-population differences in the composition of larval-associated bacterial communities are larger than intra-population variation due to a heterogeneous feeding environment. Despite significant differences in bacterial community structure within each S. droebachiensis larval population based on food availability, development, phenotype, and time, variation in OTU membership and community composition correlated more strongly with geographic location. Moreover, 20-30% of OTUs associated with larvae were specific to a single location while less than 10% were shared. Taken together, these results suggest that inter-populational variation in symbiont communities may be more pronounced than intra-populational variation, and that this difference may suggest that broad-scale ecological variables (e.g., across ocean basins) may mask smaller scale ecological variables (e.g., food availability).","2019","95","10.1093/femsec/fiz103","me","NO"

Regardless of its origin, P. diazotrophica promoted a superior accumulation of plant biomass than other bacterial species.

The Mediterranean Sea is an oligotrophic to ultra-oligotrophic marginal sea, which neighbors northern Africa (a major source of natural aerosols) and Europe (a source of mostly anthropogenic aerosols). Previous studies demonstrated that airborne bacteria deposited during dust events over the Mediterranean Sea may significantly alter the ecology and function of the surface seawater layer, yet little is known about their abundance and diversity during background non-storm conditions. Here, we describe the abundance and genetic diversity of airborne bacteria in 16 air samples collected over an East-West transect of the entire Mediterranean Sea during non-storm conditions in April 2011. The results show that airborne bacteria represent diverse groups with the most abundant bacteria from the Firmicutes (Bacilli and Clostridia) and Proteobacteria (Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, and Gammaproteobacteria) phyla. Most of the bacteria in our samples have previously been observed in the air at other open ocean locations, in the air over the Mediterranean Sea during dust storms, and in the Mediterranean seawater. Airborne bacterial abundance ranged from 0.7 x 10(4) to 2.5 x 10(4) cells m(-3) air, similar to abundances at other oceanic regimes. Our results demonstrate that airborne bacterial diversity is positively correlated with the mineral dust content in the aerosols and was spatially separated between major basins of the Mediterranean Sea. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive biogeographical dataset to assess the diversity and abundance of airborne microbes over the Mediterranean Sea.

Here we use approximately 16,000 phytoplankton samples from two large coastal ecosystems-the Baltic Sea and Chesapeake Bay-to analyze the relationship between salinity and phytoplankton species richness. Alpha diversity showed a consistent variation along the salinity gradient, with a minimum at mesohaline salinities of around 7-9. Rarefied species pools at narrow salinity intervals also showed reduced diversity at intermediate salinities, surrounded by high richness toward both ends of the gradient. The cumulative likelihood of species presence validated the minimum at intermediate salinities. Community composition changed abruptly at the alpha diversity minimum in the Baltic Sea, while it changed gradually along the salinity gradient in Chesapeake Bay. We conclude that the Remane concept is in every respect valid for phytoplankton.","2019","194","10.1086/703657","me","maybe"

This study focussed on the previously uncharacterised inland nunataks of the Jutulsessen and Ahlmannryggen ranges in Dronning Maud Land. As with many oligotrophic soils in Antarctica, bacteria from the phyla Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria were prevalent. High relative abundances of Bacteroidetes and Chloroflexi were also observed in these soils. Potential phototrophic capabilities of these bacterial populations were indicated by the presence of genes involved in the Calvin-Benson reductive pentose phosphate cycle as well as that of aerobic phototrophic bacteriochlorophyll. Clear spatial patterns of bacterial biodiversity between nunataks in this study were observed, particularly between the Jutulsessen and Ahlmannryggen nunataks which are geographically separated by the Jutulstraumen glacier. Not unexpectedly, the bacterial community profiles found in these nunataks were distinct from those found in alternate biogeographic regions (e.g. Dry Valleys, Peninsula and Larsemann Hills). Despite belonging to the same bioregion (i.e. Dronning Maud Land), however, the clear differentiation of bacterial communities between the Jutulsessen/Ahlmannryggen and that of Sor Rondane suggests that, based on bacterial phylogeography, the Dronning Maud Land bioregion can be divided into sub-bioregions.","2019","42","10.1007/s00300-019-02532-1","me","YES"

Although half of the soil C and N is stored in deep soils (below 30 cm), no regional-scale study of microbial properties and their functions through the soil profile has been conducted in these drylands. To explore the distribution and determinants of microbial properties and C and N mineralization rates through soil profile along aridity gradient at a regional scale, we investigated these variables for four soil layers (0-20, 20-40, 40-60 and 60-100 cm) in 132 plots on the Mongolia Plateau. Soil microbial properties (biomass and bacteria:fungi ratio) and C and N mineralization rates decreased with increasing soil depth and aridity at the regional scale. Aridity-induced declines in soil microbial properties mainly resulted from the negative effects of aridity on ANPP/root biomass and soil organic C (SOC) in the surface soil layers (0-20 and 20-40 cm) but from the direct and indirect (via SOC and soil C/N) negative effects of aridity in the deep soil layers (40-60 and 60-100 cm). Aridity-induced declines in soil C mineralization rates mainly resulted from the negative indirect effect of aridity on SOC and microbial properties in each soil layer, with weaker effects of SOC and stronger effects of soil microbes in the deep soil layers. Aridity-induced declines in soil N mineralization rates mainly resulted from the negative indirect effect of aridity on SOC in the three soil layers above 60 cm and mainly resulted from the negative direct effect of aridity in the 60-100 cm soil layer. Aridity via direct or indirect effects strongly determined the patterns of soil microbial properties and C and N mineralization throughout soil profiles on the Mongolian Plateau. These findings suggest that the increases in aridity are likely to induce changes in soil micro-organisms and their associated functions across soil depths of semi-arid grasslands, and future models should consider the dynamic interactions between substrates and microbial properties across soil depths in global drylands.

We developed and applied high-throughput sequencing for the 16S-23S rRNA internally transcribed spacer (ITS) to examine ecotype and fine-scale genotypic community dynamics for monthly surface water samples spanning 5 years at the San Pedro Ocean Time-series site. Ecotype-level structure displayed regular seasonal patterns including succession, consistent with strong forcing by seasonally varying abiotic parameters (e.g. temperature, nutrients, light). We identified tens to thousands of amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) within ecotypes, many of which exhibited distinct patterns over time, suggesting ecologically distinct populations within ecotypes. Community structure within some ecotypes exhibited regular, seasonal patterns, but not for others, indicating other more irregular processes such as phage interactions are important. Network analysis including T4-like phage genotypic data revealed distinct viral variants correlated with different groups of cyanobacterial ASVs including time-lagged predator-prey relationships. Variation partitioning analysis indicated that phage community structure more strongly explains cyanobacterial community structure at the ASV level than the abiotic environmental factors. These results support a hierarchical model whereby abiotic environmental factors more strongly shape niche partitioning at the broader ecotype level while phage interactions are more important in shaping community structure of fine-scale variants within ecotypes.","2019","21","10.1111/1462-2920.14687","me","maybe"
"Herren, CM","Asexual Reproduction Can Account for the High Diversity and Prevalence of Rare Taxa Observed in Microbial Communities","APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY","Recent studies evaluating the community structures of microorganisms and macroorganisms have found greater diversity and rarity within micro-scale communities, compared to macro-scale communities. However, reproductive method has been a confounding factor in these comparisons; the microbes considered generally reproduce asexually, while the macroorganisms considered generally reproduce sexually. Sexual reproduction imposes the constraint of mate finding, which can have significant demographic consequences by depressing birth rates at low population sizes. First, I construct an island biogeography model to study the organization of ecological communities under neutral stochastic processes. Then, I examine theoretically how the effects of mate finding in sexual populations translate to the emergent community properties of diversity, rarity, and dominance (size of the largest population). In mate-limited sexual populations, the decreased growth rates at low population densities translate to a higher extinction rate; this increased extinction rate had a disproportionately strong effect on taxa with low population densities. Thus, mate limitation decreased diversity, primarily by excluding small populations from communities. However, the most abundant taxa were minimally affected by mate limitation. Therefore, mate limitation affected the diversity and rarity of taxa in communities but did not alter the dominance of the largest population. The observed shifts in community structure mirror recent empirical studies of micro-scale versus macro-scale communities, which have shown that microbial communities have greater diversity and rarity than macrobial communities but are not different in dominance. Thus, reproductive method may contribute to observed differences in emergent properties between communities at these two scales. IMPORTANCE There have been numerous recent efforts to integrate microbes into broad-scale ecological theories. Microbial communities are often structurally distinct from macrobial communities, but it is unclear whether these differences are real or whether they are due to the different methodologies used to study communities at these two scales. One major difference between macroorganisms and microorganisms is that microbes are much more likely to reproduce asexually. Sexually reproducing taxa have diminished growth rates at low population size, because they must encounter another member of their species before reproducing. This study shows that communities of asexually reproducing taxa are expected to be more diverse, because taxa persist longer. Furthermore, asexually reproducing taxa can exist at much lower densities than sexually reproducing taxa. Thus, asexual reproduction by microbes can account for two major differences between microbial and macrobial communities, namely, greater diversity and greater prevalence of rare taxa for microbes.","2019","85","10.1128/AEM.01099-19","me","NO"

Here, we explore whether spatial scale-dependent patterns of beta-diversity vary between microbial functional groups and bacterial taxa (i.e., diazotrophic and bacterial communities) across local to regional scales (from metres to hundreds of kilometres). Location Eastern China. Time period October and November 2015. Major taxa studied Diazotrophic and bacterial communities. We use two complementary statistical tools to unveil biotic mechanisms (i.e., species association) underlying variation in beta-diversity of diazotrophic and bacterial communities. We examined distance-decay slopes of both communities at the local (1-113 m), meso- (3.4-39 km) and regional (103-668 km) scales. We used an environmentally constrained checkerboard score and topological features of association networks as indices of species association. We then calculated contributions of species association, abiotic factors and geographical distance to explain community beta-diversity. The scale-dependent distance-decay relationships were also examined in ubiquitous (high occupancy across samples) and endemic communities of diazotrophs and bacteria. Diazotrophs displayed steeper distance-decay slopes than bacteria, suggesting that the beta-diversity of diazotrophic communities was more variable. The distance-decay slopes were dependent on spatial scales in both communities, owing to different contributions of geographical distance, abiotic factors and species association at three spatial scales. Intriguingly, species association was greater and contributed more to community beta-diversity than other forces at the local scale, implying that species association could greatly alter community structures. Drivers of diazotrophic and bacterial community beta-diversity depended on spatial scales, resulting in different distance-decay patterns. Moreover, this was the first study to use two methods to demonstrate that species association played important, but as yet unrecognized, roles in driving spatial scale-dependent beta-diversity.

We collected soil samples from different micro-topographic positions and elevational levels in two mountain regions of the Scandes, Central Norway. Microbial community composition was characterized by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and was dependent on microtopography and elevation. Underlying environmental drivers were identified by integration of microbial community data with a comprehensive set of site-specific long-term recorded temperature and soil moisture data. Partial least square regression analysis allowed the description of ecological response patterns and the identification of the important environmental drivers for each taxonomic group. This demonstrated for the first time that taxa responding to elevation were indeed most strongly defined by temperature, rather than by other environmental factors. Micro-topography affected taxa were primarily controlled by temperature and soil moisture. In general, 5-year datasets had higher explanatory power than 1-year datasets, indicating that the microbial community composition is dependent on long-term developments of near-ground temperature and soil moisture regimes and possesses a certain resilience, which is in agreement with an often observed delayed response in global warming studies in arctic-alpine regions.","2019","13","10.1038/s41396-019-0409-9","me","YES"

Yet, our knowledge of temporal controls is comparatively limited. This is a major uncertainty in microbial ecology, as there is increasing evidence that microbial community composition is important for predicting microbial community function in the future. Here, we use continental- and global-scale soil fungal community surveys, focused within northern temperate latitudes, to estimate the relative contribution of time and space to soil fungal community turnover. We detected large intra-annual temporal differences in soil fungal community similarity, where fungal communities differed most among seasons, equivalent to the community turnover observed over thousands of kilometers in space. inter-annual community turnover was comparatively smaller than intra-annual turnover. Certain environmental covariates, particularly climate covariates, explained some spatial-temporal effects, though it is unlikely the same mechanisms drive spatial vs. temporal turnover. However, these commonly measured environmental covariates could not fully explain relationships between space, time and community composition. These baseline estimates of fungal community turnover in time provide a starting point to estimate the potential duration of legacies in microbial community composition and function.","2019","13","10.1038/s41396-019-0420-1","me","YES"

In autoclaved river water, the community was more even and became dominated by several strains growing faster or exclusively in that medium. Those strains have been reported in the literature to degrade complex compounds. Their growth rate in the community was 1.5- to 7-fold greater than that observed in monoculture.

Publishing of Red Lists of animals or higher plants is quite common, but practical protection of algae and especially microalgae is quite a complex task with several difficulties. These complications are the result of our quite poor knowledge about biodiversity (taxonomy, phylogeny) of microalgae together with insufficient data about worldwide distribution of microalgae taxa (undersampling). The need to protect microorganisms, microalgae and heterotrophic protists is a crucial matter due to their role in bioindication and evaluation of the quality of their habitats. That is why it is necessary to have a Red List of these phototrophic organisms as a practical manual for the protection of their habitat and, subsequently, also to have it as a basis for the protection of these organisms. Generally, microorganisms must be viewed not as rare species (in terms of their poor knowledge about distribution, ecology and taxonomy), but as little-known species and a Red List would reflect this idea. We propose a Red List of microalgae, using euglenophytes as a model group, with reflection of taxonomy and autecology of listed species with links to endangered habitats: habitat protection must be understood as a synonym for species conservation. Our proposal is the starting point for the evaluation of microalgal biodiversity of the Czech Republic and for deducting conclusions that can be used in the practical habitat conservation.","2019","28","10.1007/s10531-019-01792-x","me","NO"

We used a global-level hierarchical sampling scheme to comprehensively characterize the evolutionary relationships and distributional limitations of the nitrogen-fixing bacterial symbionts of the crop chickpea, generating 1,027 draft whole-genome sequences at the level of bacterial populations, including 14 high-quality PacBio genomes from a phylogenetically representative subset. We find that diverse Mesorhizobium taxa perform symbiosis with chickpea and have largely overlapping global distributions. However, sampled locations cluster based on the phylogenetic diversity of Mesorhizobium populations, and diversity clusters correspond to edaphic and environmental factors, primarily soil type and latitude. Despite long-standing evolutionary divergence and geographic isolation, the diverse taxa observed to nodulate chickpea share a set of integrative conjugative elements (ICEs) that encode the major functions of the symbiosis. This symbiosis ICE takes 2 forms in the bacterial chromosome-tripartite and monopartite-with tripartite ICEs confined to a broadly distributed superspecies Glade. The pairwise evolutionary relatedness of these elements is controlled as much by geographic distance as by the evolutionary relatedness of the background genome. In contrast, diversity in the broader gene content of Mesorhizobium genomes follows a tight linear relationship with core genome phylogenetic distance, with little detectable effect of geography.

The influence of bacteria and fungi on wine fermentation is well known. However, little is known about the role of soil microbes, other than microbial pathogens, on grape composition or their role in vintage or site (terroir) impacts on grape composition. In this study, we used an amplicon sequencing approach to investigate the potential relationships between soil microbes and inherent spatial variation in grape metabolite composition - specifically, the concentration of the impact aroma compound rotundone in Shiraz grapes (Vitis vinifera L.) grown in a 6.1 ha vineyard in the Grampians region of Victoria, Australia. Previous work had demonstrated temporal stability in patterns of within-vineyard spatial variation in rotundone concentration, enabling identification of defined zones of inherently low or high concentration of this grape metabolite. 16S rRNA and ITS region-amplicon sequencing analysis of microbial communities in the surface soils collected from these zones indicated marked differences between zones in the genetic diversity and composition of the soil bacterial and fungal microbiome. Soils in the High rotundone zone exhibited higher diversity of bacteria, but lower diversity of fungi, compared to the soils in the Low rotundone zone. In addition, the network analysis of the microbial community in the High rotundone zone soils appeared well structured, especially with respect to the bacterial community, compared to that in the Low rotundone zone soils. The key differences in the microbial community structure between the rotundone zones are obvious for taxa/groups of both bacteria and fungi, particularly for bacteria belonging to Acidobacteria-GP4 and GP7, Rhizobiales, Gaiellaceae, Alphaproteobacteria and the Nectriaceae and Tremellaceae families of fungi. Although mulching in some parts of the vineyard caused changes in bacterial and fungal composition and overall microbial catabolic diversity and activity, its effects did not mask the rotundone zone-based variation.

These patterns across phyla were consistent with their different niche positions of water depth, while the occupancy-abundance relationships were not dependent on phylum attributes. Consistently, phylum abundance was best explained by water depth; other physical and chemical factors, such as metal ion concentrations, SiO2, and pH, can also explain the variations in some bacterial phyla.

The next decade is poised to focus on microbial traits and function. Most existing methods for doing this perform pathway analysis using reference databases. This has both benefits and drawbacks. Function can go undetected if reference databases are coarse-grained or incomplete. Likewise, detection of a pathway does not guarantee expression of the associated function. Finally, function cannot be connected to specific microbial constituents, making it difficult to ascertain the types of organisms exhibiting particular traits-something that is important for understanding microbial success in specific environments. A complementary approach to pathway analysis is to use the wealth of microbial trait information collected over years of lab-based, culture experiments.MethodsHere, we use journal articles and Bergeys Manual of Systematic Bacteriology to develop a trait-based database for 971 human skin bacterial taxa. We then use this database to examine functional traits that are over/underrepresented among skin taxa. Specifically, we focus on three trait classes-binary, categorical, and quantitative-and compare trait values among skin taxa and microbial taxa more broadly. We compare binary traits using a Chi-square test, categorical traits using randomization trials, and quantitative traits using a nonparametric relative effects test based on global rankings using Tukey contrasts.ResultsWe find a number of traits that are over/underrepresented within the human skin microbiome. For example, spore formation, acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase, pigment production, catalase, and oxidase are all less common among skin taxa. As well, skin bacteria are less likely to be aerobic, favoring, instead, a facultative strategy. They are also less likely to exhibit gliding motility, less likely to be spirillum or rod-shaped, and less likely to grow in chains. Finally, skin bacteria have more difficulty at high pH, prefer warmer temperatures, and are much less resilient to hypotonic conditions.ConclusionsOur analysis shows how an approach that relies on information from culture experiments can both support findings from pathway analysis, and also generate new insights into the structuring principles of microbial communities.","2019","7","10.1186/s40168-019-0698-2","me","NO"

Phylogenetic analyses (based on SSU rRNA and ITS-1,2 for microalgae, or the SSU-LSU ITS region for cyanobacteria) provided unambiguous identifications of 20 strains (37.7% of all strains investigated) to species level; the identifications had to be corrected after preliminary morphological determination of eight strains. For 27 strains (50.9%), identification with molecular markers was possible only to genus or group of closely related species, because a modern taxonomic revision of these taxa is preliminary, incomplete or non-existent. Identification to genus was problematic for six strains (11.3%). This combination of morphological and molecular methods (integrative approach) resulted in the discovery of rare, taxonomically or ecologically interesting taxa, and in the description of a new species of Tetradesmus (T. arenicola sp. nov.), a new combination for Chlamydomonas callunae (Heterochlamydomonas callunae comb. nov.), epitypification of the rare alga Actinochloris sphaerica and emendation of the recently described Eremochloris sphaerica. A microscopic culture-dependent method and an integrative approach provided similar results concerning the cyanobacterial and algal diversity of BSCs of Baltic sand dunes in general. However, this investigation using an integrative approach allowed us to precisely identify species of several important taxa (the most common and dominant species) in the community structure of BSCs, and also certain rare representatives.","2019","54","10.1080/09670262.2018.1557257","me","not yet"

However, our knowledge of their diversity and regional biogeographic patterns in high-altitude alpine lakes is limited. In this study, to investigate the diversity and geographic patterns of the FL and PA bacterial communities and to quantify the relative influence of environmental filtering and dispersal limitation in shaping the FL and PA bacterial communities, we collected surface water samples from 26 lakes over 1000 kilometers on the Tibetan Plateau. The majority of sequences exclusively in the FL bacteria were Actinobacteria (29.4%), Proteobacteria (27.7%) and Bacteroidetes (21.6%), while sequences exclusively in the PA bacteria were dominated by Proteobacteria (57.9%). The alpha-diversity indices, including Shannon index and Pielous evenness, were significantly lower in the FL bacteria than that in PA bacteria. The surrounding soils as an important potential source contributed more to the diversity of the PA bacteria than the FL bacteria. Both of the FL and PA bacterial communities exhibited a significant regional distance-decay pattern. Environmental filtering and dispersal limitation were significantly related to the spatial variation of the FL and PA bacterial communities, whereas the environmental filtering/dispersal limitation effect ratio was higher in the FL bacterial communities.

"Bartelme, RP; Smith, MC; Sepulveda-Villet, OJ; Newton, RJ","Component Microenvironments and System Biogeography Structure Microorganism Distributions in Recirculating Aquaculture and Aquaponic Systems","MSPHERE","Flowthrough and pond aquaculture system microbiome management practices aim to mitigate fish disease and stress. However, the operational success of recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) depends directly on system microbial community activities. In RAS, each component environment is engineered for a specific microbial niche for waste management, as the water continuously flowing through the system must be processed before returning to the rearing tank. In this study, we compared waste management component microbiomes (rearing tank water, pH correction tank, solid-waste clarifier, biofilter, and degassing tower) within a commercial-scale freshwater RAS by high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing. To assess consistency among freshwater RAS microbiomes, we also compared the microbial community compositions of six aquaculture and aquaponic farms. Community assemblages reflected site and source water relationships, and the presence of a hydroponic subsystem was a major community determinant. In contrast to the facility-specific community composition, some sequence variants, mainly classified into Flavobacterium, Cetobacterium, the family Sphingomonadaceae, and nitrifying guilds of ammonia-oxidizing archaea and Nitrospira, were common across all facilities. The findings of this study suggest that, independently of system design, core taxa exist across RAS rearing similar fish species but that system design informs the individual aquatic microbiome assemblages. Future RAS design would benefit from understanding the roles of these core taxa and then capitalizing on their activities to further reduce system waste/added operational controls. IMPORTANCE Recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) are agroecosystems for intensive on-land cultivation of products of fisheries. Practitioners that incorporate edible plant production into RAS refer to these facilities as aquaponic systems (AP). RAS have the potential to offset declining production levels of wild global fisheries while reducing waste and product distance to market, but system optimization is needed to reduce costs. Both RAS and AP rely on microbial consortia for maintaining water quality and promoting fish/plant health, but little is known about the microorganisms actually present. This lack of knowledge prevents optimization of designs and operational controls to target the growth of beneficial microbial species or consortia. The significance of our research is in identifying the common microorganisms that inhabit production RAS and AP and the operational factors that influence which microorganisms colonize and become abundant. Identifying these organisms is a first step toward advanced control of microbial activities that improve reproducibility and reduce costs.","2019","4","10.1128/mSphere.00143-19","me","not yet"

To explore the contributions of these factors to skin microbiome variation, we profiled the bacterial microbiomes of 495 North American subjects (ages, 9 to 78 years) at four skin surfaces plus the oral epithelium using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. We collected subject metadata, including host physiological parameters, through standardized questionnaires and noninvasive biophysical methods. Using a combination of statistical modeling tools, we found that demographic, lifestyle, and physiological factors collectively explained 12 to 20% of the variability in microbiome composition. The influence of health factors was strongest on the oral microbiome. Associations between host factors and the skin microbiome were generally dominated by operational taxonomic units (OTUs) affiliated with the Clostridiales and Prevotella. A subset of the correlations between microbial features and host attributes were site specific. To further explore the relationship between age and the skin microbiome of the forehead, we trained a Random Forest regression model to predict chronological age from microbial features. Age was associated mostly with two mutually coexcluding Corynebacterium OTUs. Furthermore, skin aging variables (wrinkles and hyperpigmented spots) were independently correlated to these taxa. IMPORTANCE Many studies have highlighted the importance of body site and individuality in shaping the composition of the human skin microbiome, but we still have a poor understanding of how extrinsic (e.g., lifestyle) and intrinsic (e.g., age) factors influence its composition. We characterized the bacterial microbiomes of North American volunteers at four skin sites and the mouth. We also collected extensive subject metadata and measured several host physiological parameters. Integration of host and microbial features showed that the skin microbiome was predominantly associated with demographic, lifestyle, and physiological factors. Furthermore, we uncovered reproducible associations between chronological age, skin aging, and members of the genus Corynebacterium. Our work provides new understanding of the role of host selection and lifestyle in shaping skin microbiome composition. It also contributes to a more comprehensive appreciation of the factors that drive interindividual skin microbiome variation.","2019","10","10.1128/mBio.00839-19","me","not yet"

In continuous cropping, however, the concentrations of root exudates of which daidzein is one of the major secretions might influence nodulating rhizobium communities and cause ineffective nitrogen fixation in soybean. The dynamics of indigenous rhizobia that form nodules with the soybean cultivars Tamahomare, Enrei and Tamabaguro at three cycles of a continuous cropping plot under different experimental conditions were examined. PCR-RFLP analysis targeted to the 16S-23S rRNA gene internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of a bacterium, confirmed by sequencing analysis, was used to determine the bacterial type for each root nodule. The results showed that as the number of cycles increased, the proportion of B. diazoefficiens USDA110 of all cultivars decreased. Under all experimental conditions, the average differences between the proportion of B. diazoefficiens USDA110 of the first and third cycles in Tamahomare, Enrei and Tamabaguro were 67%, 70% and 44%, respectively. After the HPLC analysis of the root-secreted isoflavonoids, the results showed that the root-secreted daidzein from Tambaguro was excreted in the highest levels among the three cultivars. Increase of the proportion of B. diazoefficiens USDA110 among seedlings treated with daidzein was also noted. Therefore, the present study reports that the symbiotic relationship of soybean with B. diazoefficiens USDA110 decreases in continuous cropping and suggests that root-secreted daidzein helps to maintain populations of this rhizobial strain in rhizosphere of some cultivars.","2019","93","10.1016/j.ejsobi.2019.103098","me","not yet"

Although measurements of pelagic marine N-2 fixation are predominantly from oligotrophic oceanic regions, where N limitation is thought to favor growth of diazotrophic microbes, here we report high rates of N-2 fixation from seven cruises spanning four seasons in temperate, western North Atlantic coastal waters along the North American continental shelf between Cape Hatteras and Nova Scotia, an area representing 6.4% of the North Atlantic continental shelf area. Integrating average areal rates of N-2 fixation during each season and for each domain in the study area, the estimated N input from N-2 fixation to this temperate shelf system is 0.02 Tmol N/year, an amount equivalent to that previously estimated for the entire North Atlantic continental shelf. Unicellular group A cyanobacteria (UCYN-A) were most often the dominant diazotrophic group expressing nifH, a gene encoding the nitrogenase enzyme, throughout the study area during all seasons. This expands the domain of these diazotrophs to include coastal waters where dissolved N concentrations are not always depleted. Further, the high rates of N-2 fixation and diazotroph diversity along the western North Atlantic continental shelf underscore the need to reexamine the biogeography and the activity of diazotrophs along continental margins.

However, the diversity of microorganisms and the factors that control it are poorly understood. Using a systematic global-sampling effort, we analysed the 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequences from similar to 1,200 activated sludge samples taken from 269 WWTPs in 23 countries on 6 continents. Our analyses revealed that the global activated sludge bacterial communities contain similar to 1 billion bacterial phylotypes with a Poisson lognormal diversity distribution. Despite this high diversity, activated sludge has a small, global core bacterial community (n = 28 operational taxonomic units) that is strongly linked to activated sludge performance. Meta-analyses with global datasets associate the activated sludge microbiomes most closely to freshwater populations. In contrast to macroorganism diversity, activated sludge bacterial communities show no latitudinal gradient. Furthermore, their spatial turnover is scale-dependent and appears to be largely driven by stochastic processes (dispersal and drift), although deterministic factors (temperature and organic input) are also important. Our findings enhance our mechanistic understanding of the global diversity and biogeography of activated sludge bacterial communities within a theoretical ecology framework and have important implications for microbial ecology and wastewater treatment processes.","2019","4","10.1038/s41564-019-0426-5","me","not yet"

Microbiome studies that combine population genetic, environment, and geographic data for wild organisms can be very informative, especially in situations where host genetic variation and the environment both influence microbiome variation. The few studies that have related population genetic and microbiome variation in wild populations have been constrained by observation-based kinship data or incomplete genomic information. Here we integrate population genomic and microbiome analyses in wild threespine stickleback fish distributed throughout western Oregon, USA. We found that gut microbiome diversity and composition partitioned more among than within wild host populations and was better explained by host population genetic divergence than by environment and geography.

To gain an on-site overview of the remote, ultraoligotrophic microbial community of the SPG, we developed a novel on-board analysis pipeline, which combines next-generation sequencing with fluorescence in situ hybridization and automated cell enumeration. We tested the pipeline during the SO-245 UltraPac cruise from Chile to New Zealand and found that the overall microbial community of the SPG was highly similar to those of other oceanic gyres. The SPG was dominated by 20 major bacterial clades, including SAR11, SAR116, the AEGEAN-169 marine group, SAR86, Prochlorococcus, SAR324, SAR406, and SAR202. Most of the bacterial clades showed a strong vertical (20m to 5,000 m), but only a weak longitudinal (80 degrees W to 160 degrees W), distribution pattern. Surprisingly, in the central gyre, Prochlorococcus, the dominant photosynthetic organism, had only low cellular abundances in the upper waters (20 to 80 m) and was more frequent around the 1% irradiance zone (100 to 150 m). Instead, the surface waters of the central gyre were dominated by the SAR11, SAR86, and SAR116 clades known to harbor light-driven proton pumps. The alphaproteobacterial AEGEAN-169 marine group was particularly abundant in the surface waters of the central gyre, indicating a potentially interesting adaptation to ultraoligotrophic waters and high solar irradiance. In the future, the newly developed community analysis pipeline will allow for on-site insights into a microbial community within 35 h of sampling, which will permit more targeted sampling efforts and hypothesis-driven research. IMPORTANCE The South Pacific Gyre, due to its vast size and remoteness, is one of the least-studied oceanic regions on earth. However, both remote sensing and in situ measurements indicated that the activity of its microbial community contributes significantly to global biogeochemical cycles. Presented here is an unparalleled investigation of the microbial community of the SPG from 20- to 5,000-m depths covering a geographic distance of similar to 7,000 km. This insight was achieved through the development of a novel on-board analysis pipeline, which combines next-generation sequencing with fluorescence in situ hybridization and automated cell enumeration. The pipeline is well comparable to onshore systems based on the Illumina platforms and yields microbial community data in less than 35 h after sampling. Going forward, the ability to gain on-site knowledge of a remote microbial community will permit hypothesis-driven research, through the generation of novel scientific questions and subsequent additional targeted sampling efforts.","2019","85","10.1128/AEM.00184-19","me","not yet"

Microbial diversity and biogeography in this region is still not understood. Here, we present the first molecular characterization of fungal, bacterial, and archaeal communities in soils from different habitats within the largest Fijian island, Viti Levu. Soil samples were collected from under native vegetation in maritime-, forest-, stream-, grassland-, and casuarina-dominated habitats, as well as from under the introduced agricultural crops sugarcane, cassava, pine, and mahogany. Soil microbial diversity was analyzed through MiSeq amplicon sequencing of 16S (for prokaryotes), ITS, LSU ribosomal DNA (for fungi). Prokaryotic communities were dominated by Proteobacteria (similar to 25%), Acidobacteria (similar to 19%), and Actinobacteria (similar to 17%), and there were no indicator species associated with particular habitats. ITS and LSU were congruent in -diversity patterns of fungi, and fungal communities were dominated by Ascomycota (similar to 57-64%), followed by Basidiomycota (similar to 20-23%) and Mucoromycota (similar to 10%) according to ITS, or Chytridiomycota (similar to 9%) according to LSU. Indicator species analysis of fungi found statistical associations of Cenococcum, Wilcoxina, and Rhizopogon to Pinus caribaea. We hypothesize these obligate biotrophic fungi were co-introduced with their host plant. Entoloma was statistically associated with grassland soils, and Fusarium and Lecythophora with soils under cassava. Observed richness varied from 65 (casuarina) to 404 OTUs (cassava) for fungi according to ITS region, and from 1268 (pine) to 2931 OTUs (cassava) for bacteria and archaea. A major finding of this research is that nearly 25% of the fungal OTUs are poorly classified, indicative of novel biodiversity in this region.

"Beyer, JE; Zamor, RM; Hambright, KD","Detection limits affect the predictability of the presence of an invasive harmful alga across geographic space","BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS","To better comprehend microbial invasions, researchers need more insight into how environmental conditions affect biogeographic patterns in microbes. Recent study suggests that environmental conditions are important predictors for when invasive microbes might become established, actively participating members of a community, but that dispersal also can be important in determining invasion success in conducive environments. In this study, we explored how detection limits affected the ability of a local-scale environmental model to predict the presence of the putative microbial invader Prymnesium parvum at a regional scale. The local-scale model was robust when applied to the regional dataset. Regardless of sensitivity (i.e., minimum detection limit used), P. parvum presence was well predicted by environmental parameters. The highest accuracy was obtained at a detection limit that corresponds with detection limits routinely achieved using standard microscope-based analysis, while lower detection limits typical of molecular approaches worsened the models predictive capabilities. Although many mechanisms may be limiting our ability to predict P. parvum presence at low abundances (e.g., dispersal, source-sink dynamics, methodological limitations), we argue here that environmental filtering plays a role in regulating population growth above these low abundances. The importance of environmental traits in predicting the presence of this microbial species suggests that environmental conditions are critical determinants of the establishment and spread of P. parvum.","2019","21","10.1007/s10530-019-01977-z","me","not yet"

This study explored the dynamics of soil bacterial communities during the plant growing season and their interaction with soil carbon and nitrogen, physicochemical properties, plant biomass and diversity following afforestation. The study investigated afforested lands containing Robinia pseudoacacia L (RP) and Caragana korshinskii Kom (CK), as well as abandoned land (AL) and farmland (FL) in the Loess Hilly Region of northern China. After establishment on former FL for 40 years, the Richness and Shannons index, above-ground herbaceous biomass (AGB) and below-ground biomass (BGB) in RP and CK increased by 0.5, 0.1, 1.2 and 1.7 times, respectively, compared with AL. Additionally, the soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), dissolved organic carbon/nitrogen (DOC/N) and microbial biomass carbon/nitrogen (MBC/N) increased by 1.7, 1.9, 0.8 and 2.5 times, respectively, while the soil bacterial abundance and alpha diversity (Shannon index) increased by 4.7% and 2.0% compared with FL. During the growing season, the soil carbon and nitrogen content was higher in August or October than in April or June. Particularly, the AGB, DOC and MBC showed a temporal pattern of normal distribution that was 36.7%, 48.2% and 74.9% higher in August than the rest of the study period. The BGB also increased by 123.5% in October compared with June in all study areas. The soil bacterial abundance in afforested lands was also higher in October, and beta bacterial diversity (Principal coordinates analysis plots: PCoA) was greater in June and August than in April and October. The dominant bacterial taxa, Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes, were significantly higher in afforested lands than in FL, and Proteobacteria increased from April to October, while Actinobacteria and Acidobacteria peaked in June or August. These seasonal changes in the soil bacterial community were significantly correlated with carbon and nitrogen levels of soil and plant biomass, especially with DOC and BGB. Additionally, soil variables explained 41.2% of the total variation in bacterial dominant phyla, while plant biomass only explained 20.2% of it, which indicates that soil properties are more important controlling factors of the bacterial community than plant biomass. In conclusion, soil variables change seasonally, which drives the composition and diversity of the soil bacterial community to exhibit a temporal pattern over the growing season after return of AL to forest.","2019","178","10.1016/j.catena.2019.03.021","me","not yet"

This ecosystem also has a great ecological importance, but is highly susceptible to anthropogenic disturbances. The balance of mangrove ecosystem depends largely on the microbial communities in mangrove sediments. Thus, understanding how the mangrove microbial communities respond to spatial differences is essential for more accurate assessment of mangrove ecosystem health. To this end, we performed the first medium-distance (150 km) research on the biogeographic distribution of mangrove microbial communities. The hypervariable regions of 165 rRNA gene was sequenced by Illumina to compare the microbial communities in mangrove sediments collected from six locations (i.e. Zhenzhu harbor, Yuzhouping, Maowei Sea, Qinzhou harbor, Beihai city and Shankou) along the coastline of Beibu Gulf in Guangxi province, China. Collectively, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, Actinobacteria, Parvarchaeota, Acidobacteria and Cyanobacteria were the predominant phyla in the mangrove sediments of this area. At genus level, the heat map of microbial communities reflected similarities between study sites and was in agreement with their biogeographic characteristics. Interestingly, the genera Desulfococcus, Arcobacter, Nitrosopumilus and Sulfurimonas showed differences in abundance between study sites. Furthermore, the principal component analysis (PCA) and unweighted UniFrac cluster tree of beta diversity were used to study the biogeographic diversity of the microbial communities. Relatively broader variation of microbial communities was found in Beihai city and Qinzhou harbour, suggesting that environmental condition and historical events may play an important role in shaping the bacterial communities as well. This is the first report on medium-distance range distribution of bacteria in the mangrove swamp ecosystem. Our data is valuable for monitoring and evaluation of the impact of human activity on mangrove habitats from the perspective of microbiome.","2019","9","10.1038/s41598-019-45804-w","me","not yet"

The relative importance of deterministic and stochastic processes for key bacterial and archaeal assemblages (i.e., core-satellite and habitat generalist-specialist) in AS from 13 wastewater treatment plants in China was investigated using 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing. The results obtained indicated 1,388 and 369 core operational taxonomic units (OTUs), 1,038 and 1,683 satellite OTUs, 255 and 48 habitat generalist OTUs, and 192 and 111 habitat specialist OTUs for Bacteria and Archaea, respectively. The proportions of shared OTUs between core and habitat specialist communities were similar to or higher than those between core and habitat generalist communities, suggesting a stronger inter-linkage between the former two groups. Deterministic processes, indicated by abundance-based beta-null models, were responsible for shaping core communities, in which NH4-N, OrgC/OrgN, Cr, and Ni were the main controlling factors. In contrast, satellite communities were predominantly influenced by stochastic processes. Moreover, we found that deterministic and stochastic processes were mainly responsible for shaping the assembly of habitat specialists and generalists, respectively. However, the influence of deterministic factors on habitat specialists remains unclear. The present study provides novel insights into the assembly mechanisms of AS microbial communities.","2019","34","10.1264/jsme2.ME18107","me","not yet"

To investigate the structural composition of the microbiome associated with tomato roots under natural systems, we characterized the bacterial, archaeal, and fungal communities of three belowground compartments (rhizosphere, endosphere, and bulk soil) of tomato plants collected from 23 greenhouses in 7 geographic locations of South Korea. The microbial diversity and structure varied by rhizocompartment, with the most distinctive community features found in the endosphere. The bacterial and fungal communities in the bulk soil and rhizosphere were correlated with soil physicochemical properties, such as pH, electrical conductivity, and exchangeable cation levels, while this trend was not evident in the endosphere samples. A small number of core bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) present in all samples from the rhizosphere and endosphere represented more than 60% of the total relative abundance. Among these core microbes, OTUs belonging to the genera Acidovorax, Enterobacter, Pseudomonas, Rhizobium, Streptomyces, and Variovorax, members of which are known to have beneficial effects on plant growth, were more relatively abundant in the endosphere samples. A co-occurrence network analysis indicated that the microbial community in the rhizosphere had a larger and more complex network than those in the bulk soil and endosphere. The analysis also identified keystone taxa that might play important roles in microbe-microbe interactions in the community. Additionally, profiling of predicted gene functions identified many genes associated with membrane transport in the endospheric and rhizospheric communities. Overall, the data presented here provide preliminary insight into bacterial, archaeal, and fungal phylogeny, functionality, and interactions in the rhizocompartments of tomato roots under real-world environments.","2019","9","10.1038/s41598-019-45660-8","me","not yet"

Nearly all bacterial 16S rDNA sequences were classified into the order Bacillales. Fifteen genera were detected, with Bacillus, Paenibacillus, and Brevibacillus being the three most abundant genera. Although more than 2,000 OTUs were obtained across all samples, 33 OTUs were confirmed as the abundant species with a relative abundance over 5% in at least one sample. Pairwise analysis showed that the diversity of Bacillus-like bacterial communities were significantly and positively correlated with soil total carbon contents and soil sampling latitudes, which suggests that a latitudinal gradient diversity of Bacillus-like bacterial communities exists in the black soil zone. The principal coordinates analysis revealed that the Bacillus-like bacterial communities were remarkably affected by soil sampling latitudes and soil total carbon content. In general, this study demonstrated that a distinct biogeographic distribution pattern of cultivable Bacillus-like bacterial communities existed in the black soil zone, which emphasizes that the strategy of local isolation and application of beneficial Bacillus-like strains is rather important in black soil agriculture development.","2019","10","10.3389/fmicb.2019.01424","me","not yet"

In this work, the antagonistic interactions among 82 strains belonging to different Pseudomonas species isolated from six different environmental niches have been investigated to check whether it might be related to the environmental niches and/or to the taxonomical affiliation. The bacterial panel included 20 strains from Echinacea purpurea (12 from roots, 8 from the rhizosphere), 19 from Phragmites australis, 20 from the Acquarossa river (13 and 7 from red and black epilithon, respectively), 9 strains from red epilithon of the Infernaccio waterfalls, 5 Antarctic strains, and 9 strains from the Amazon rainforest. Data obtained revealed that 81 out of the 82 strains exhibited an antagonistic activity (even though at a different extent) and that the environmental characteristics, which also determine different adaptative strategies, might be the main factor affecting antagonism among bacteria, even more than taxonomy. Strains isolated from heavy metal enriched river biofilms were described as the most active, while endophytic and rhizospheric strains were the most sensitive. This research, representing the first report in which Pseudomonas bacterial strains isolated from different ecological niches have been tested for their interaction abilities, opens new perspectives in discovering putative new antimicrobial compounds from different (extreme) environments.","2019","31","10.1080/03949370.2019.1621391","me","not yet"
"Hassett, BT; Thines, M; Buaya, A; Ploch, S; Gradinger, R","A glimpse into the biogeography, seasonality, and ecological functions of arctic marine Oomycota","IMA FUNGUS","High-latitude environments are warming, leading to changes in biological diversity patterns of taxa. Oomycota are a group of fungal-like organisms that comprise a major Glade of eukaryotic life and are parasites of fish, agricultural crops, and algae. The diversity, functionality, and distribution of these organisms are essentially unknown in the Arctic marine environment. Thus, it was our aim to conduct a first screening, using a functional gene assay and high-throughput sequencing of two gene regions within the 18S rRNA locus to examine the diversity, richness, and phylogeny of marine Oomycota within Arctic sediment, seawater, and sea ice. We detected Oomycota at every site sampled and identified regionally localized taxa, as well as taxa that existed in both Alaska and Svalbard. While the recently described diatom parasite Miracula helgolandica made up about 50% of the oomycete reads found, many lineages were observed that could not be assigned to known species, including several that clustered with another recently described diatom parasite, Olpidiopsis drebesii. Across the Arctic, Oomycota comprised a maximum of 6% of the entire eukaryotic microbial community in Barrow, Alaska May sediment and 10% in sea ice near the Svalbard archipelago. We found Arctic marine Oomycota encode numerous genes involved in parasitism and carbon cycling processes. Ultimately, these data suggest that Arctic marine Oomycota are a reservoir of uncharacterized biodiversity, the majority of which are probably parasites of diatoms, while others might cryptically cycle carbon or interface other unknown ecological processes. As the Arctic continues to warm, lower-latitude Oomycota might migrate into the Arctic Ocean and parasitize non-coevolved hosts, leading to incalculable shifts in the primary producer community.","2019","10","10.1186/s43008-019-0006-6","me","not yet"

In this study, soils were sampled from 30 grasslands across >2000 km on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau to determine the distribution patterns of methanotrophs and their driving factors at a regional scale. Methanotroph abundance and community composition were analyzed using quantitative PCR and Illumina Miseq sequencing of pmoA genes, respectively. The pmoA gene copies ranged from 8.2 x 10(5) to 1.1 x 10(8) per gram dry soil. Among the 30 grassland soil samples, Upland Soil Cluster Gamma (USC gamma) dominated the methanotroph communities in 26 samples. Jasper Ridge Cluster (JR3) was the most dominant methanotrophic cluster in two samples; while Methylocystis, cluster FWs, and Methylobacter were abundant in other two wet soil samples. Interestingly, reanalyzing the pmoA genes sequencing data from existing publications suggested that USC gamma was also the main methanotrophic cluster in grassland soils in other regions, especially when their mean annual precipitation was <500 mm. Canonical Analysis of Principal Coordinates including all soil samples indicated that the methanotrophic community composition was significantly correlated with local environmental factors, among which mean annual precipitation and pH showed the strongest correlations. Variance partitioning analysis showed that environmental factors and spatial distance were significant factors affecting the community structure of methanotrophs, and environmental properties were more important factors. Collectively, these findings indicate that atmospheric methane may be mainly oxidized by USC gamma in upland soils. They also highlight the key role of water availability and pH in determining the abundance and community profiles of grassland soil methanotrophs. (C) 2019 The Authors.

While there is a pressing need to remediate polluted ecosystems, human intervention might unwittingly oppose selection for natural detoxification, which is primarily carried out by microbes. We test this possibility in the context or a ubiquitous chemical remediation strategy aimed at targeting metal pollution: the addition of lime-containing material. Here, we show that raising pH by liming decreased the availability of toxic metals in acidic mine-degraded soils, hut as a consequence selected against microbial taxa that naturally remediate soil through the production of metal-binding siderophores. Our results therefore highlight the crucial need to consider the eco-evolutionary consequences of human environmental strategies on microbial ecosystem services and other traits.","2019","286","10.1098/rspb.2019.0804","me","not yet"

Here, we investigated the diversity and composition of microorganisms in karst and non-karst environments under natural restoration and artificial rehabilitation conditions. The results showed no significant differences in soil microbial diversity, but the microbial communities associated with geological conditions and tree species differed significantly. Variation partitioning analysis (VPA) showed that a total of 77.3% of the variation in bacteria and a total of 69.3% of the variation in fungi could be explained by vegetation type and geological background. There were significant differences in six bacterial classes (Actinobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Ktedonobacteria, TK10, Gammaproteobacteria, and Anaerolineae) and nine fungal classes (Eurotiomycetes, Agaricomycetes, unclassified _p_Ascomycota, Sordariomycetes, Tremellomycetes, norank_k_Fungi, Pezizomycetes, Leotiomycetes and Archaeorhizomycetes) among the soils collected from six plots. A Spearman correlation heatmap showed that the microbial community was affected by the major soil properties. Principal coordinates analysis indicated that the microbial community of Pinus yunnanensis in the artificial forest, which was established for the protection of the environment was most similar to that in the natural secondary forest in the karst ecosystem.

Absorption coefficients at 254 nm (a(254)) and 325 nm (a(325)), indices (a(254)/a(365)) and spectral slopes (between 275 and 295 nm, S275-295) were calculated from the dissolved fraction of the UV absorption spectra to describe the amount and quality of CDOM. Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) were applied to evaluate the relevance of physical and biogeochemical drivers for the variability of CDOM. Besides the low CDOM values, a first division of our data following the Longhursts biogeographic classification showed significant differences in CDOM levels among provinces. The lowest values of a(254) and a(325) were found in the oligotrophic gyres, particularly in the Indian Ocean, and the highest in the upwelling areas, particularly in the Equatorial Pacific. Opposite distributions were obtained for S275-295 and a(254)/a(365), indicative of higher photobleaching in the gyres. Within each province, whereas a(254) was constant through the photic layer, a(325) increased significantly with depth as a result of the dominance of photobleaching over biological production in the surface layer and the opposite at depth. The Pacific provinces, including the subtropical gyres, showed, however, significantly higher a(325) values, indicative of lower photobleaching/higher biological production. The GAM analysis indicates that a(254) and a(325) were primarily related to chlorophyll a (Chl a), exhibiting a significant positive linear response. Interestingly, Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus abundances were related to these absorption coefficients. Apparent oxygen utilization also contributed to explain the distributions of these absorption coefficients, being inversely related to a(254) and directly related to a(325). These results are consistent with the premise that a(254) could be a proxy for the concentration of dissolved organic carbon and a(325) for the aromatic by-products of biological degradation. The GAM analysis also shows that a(254)/a(365) and S275-295 exhibited inverse relationships with solar radiation, indicating that the biological production of CDOM counteracts photodegradation as solar radiation increases. In summary, whereas photobleaching dictates the vertical distribution of CDOM, Chl a explains the CDOM differences among the photic layer of the tropical and subtropical ocean provinces visited during the circumnavigation.","2019","6","10.3389/fmars.2019.00320","me","not yet"

The present study examined the spatial variability of the physicochemical characteristics of an extreme alkaline saline soil and how they controlled the archaeal and bacterial communities so as to determine the main spatial community drivers. Methods: The archaeal and bacterial community structure, and soil characteristics were determined at 13 points along a 211 m transect in the former lake Texcoco. Geostatistical techniques were used to describe spatial patterns of the microbial community and soil characteristics and determine soil properties that defined the prokaryotic community structure. Results: A high variability in electrolytic conductivity (EC) and water content (WC) was found. Euryarchaeota dominated Archaea, except when the EC was low. Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria were the dominant bacterial phyla independent of large variations in certain soil characteristics. Multivariate analysis showed that soil WC affected the archaeal community structure and a geostatistical analysis found that variation in the relative abundance of Euryarchaeota was controlled by EC. The bacterial alpha diversity was less controlled by soil characteristics at the scale of this study than the archaeal alpha diversity. Discussion: Results indicated that WC and EC played a major role in driving the microbial communities distribution and scale and sampling strategies were important to define spatial patterns.","2019","7","10.7717/peerj.6127","me","not yet"

Mitochondrial cytb sequence near-identity with sympatric R. robustus (genotype II) raised doubts about the taxonomic status of R. montenegrensis, but comparative studies have reported fairly clear morphological and genetic differences between R. montenegrensis and laboratory stocks identified as R. robustus. Here, we use a transcriptome-based approach to investigate this apparent paradox.ResultsWe retrieved publicly-available transcriptome sequence-reads from R. montenegrensis and from the R. robustus stocks used as the taxonomic benchmark in comparative studies. We (i) aligned transcriptome sequence-reads to mitochondrial (cytb) and nuclear (ITS2, D2-28S and AmpG) query sequences (47 overall) from members of the R. prolixus-R. robustus cryptic-species complex and related taxa; (ii) computed breadth- and depth-coverage for the 259 consensus sequences generated by these alignments; and, for each locus, (iii) appraised query sequences and full-breadth-coverage consensus sequences in terms of nucleotide-sequence polymorphism and phylogenetic relations. We found evidence confirming that R. montenegrensis and R. robustus genotype II are genetically indistinguishable and, hence, implying that they are, in all likelihood, the same species. Furthermore, we found compelling genetic evidence that the benchmark R. robustus stocks used in R. montenegrensis description and in later transcriptome-based comparisons are in fact R. prolixus, although likely mixed to some degree with R. robustus (probably genotype II, a.k.a. R. montenegrensis).ConclusionsWe illustrate how public-domain genetic/transcriptomic data can help address challenging issues in disease-vector systematics. In our case-study, taxonomic confusion apparently stemmed from the misinterpretation of sequence-data analyses and misidentification of taxonomic-benchmark stocks. More generally, and together with previous reports of mixed and/or misidentified Rhodnius spp. laboratory colonies, our results call into question the conclusions of many studies (on morphology, genetics, physiology, behavior, bionomics or interactions with microorganisms including trypanosomes) based on non-genotyped R. prolixus or R. robustus stocks. Correct species identification is a prerequisite for investigating the factors that underlie the physiological, behavioral or ecological differences between primary domestic vectors of Chagas disease, such as R. prolixus, and their sylvatic, medically less-relevant relatives such as R. robustus (s.l.) including R. montenegrensis.","2019","12","10.1186/s13071-019-3558-9","me","not yet"

However, the relative contributions of abiotic and biotic factors to soil denitrification potential at the regional and sub-regional scales in grassland ecosystems remain elusive. In this study, soil samples were collected from 21 sites at three steppes of China, including the Inner Mongolia Plateau (IMP), the Xinjiang Autonomous Region (XAR) and the Tibetan Plateau (TP) grasslands. Results showed that the key factors controlling the denitrification potential were regional and scale-dependent. At the sub-regional scales, soil pH, aridity index (AI) and total organic carbon (TOC) explained the highest variances on denitrification potential in the IMP, XAR and TP steppe, respectively. At the regional scale, the mean annual precipitation (MAP) was the most important environmental driver for the denitrification potential. Partial least squares (PLS) path modeling revealed that the MAP might regulate denitrification potential directly and indirectly by its effects on the plant and soil properties. Overall, these results help to improve our understandings on the prediction of the denitrification potential under global changes and revealed that the denitrification potential at various scales could be regulated by the multiple interactions of abiotic and biotic factors.

However, we know little about their relationships with plants at large scales. Here, using soil fungal data collected from 28 forest reserves across China, we explored the latitudinal diversity gradients of overall fungi and different fungal functional guilds, including putative plant pathogens, EMF, and saprotrophic fungi. We further linked the spatial patterns of alpha diversities of putative plant pathogens and EMF to the variation of plant species richness. We found that the relationships between latitude and alpha diversities of putative plant pathogens and EMF were region-dependent with sharp diversity shifts around the mid-latitude (similar to 35 degrees N), which differed from the unimodal diversity distributions of the overall and saprotrophic fungi. The variations in the diversities of putative plant pathogens and EMF were largely explained by the spatial regions (south vs. north/subtropical zone vs. temperate zone). Additionally, the alpha diversities of these two fungal guilds exhibited opposing trends across latitude. EMF could alter the relationship between diversities of putative plant pathogens and plants in the south/subtropical region, but not vice versa. We also found that the ratio of their alpha diversities (EMF to putative plant pathogens) was negatively related to plant species richness across the spatial regions (north to south), and explained similar to 10% of the variation of plant species richness. Overall, our findings suggest that plant-microbe interactions not only shape the local plant diversity but also may have non-negligible contributions to the large-scale patterns of plant diversity in forest ecosystems.","2019","7","10.3389/fevo.2019.00216","me","not yet"

To characterize the effects of hypoxia on bacterioplankton, bacterial community structure and function were investigated in the Changjiang Estuary. Water samples were collected from three layers (surface, middle, and bottom) at ten sampling sites in the Changjiang Estuary hypoxic and non-hypoxic zones. The community structure was analyzed using high-throughput sequencing of 16S rDNA genes, and the predictive metagenomic approach was used to investigate the functions of the bacterial community. Co-occurrence networks are constructed to investigate the relationship between different bacterioplankton. The results showed that community composition in hypoxic and non-hypoxic zones were markedly different. The diversity and richness of bacterial communities in the bottom layer (hypoxic zone) were remarkably higher than that of the surface layer (non-hypoxic). In the non-hypoxic zone, it was found that Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Flavobacteriia were the dominant groups while Alphaproteobacteria, SAR406 and Deltaproteobacteria were the dominant groups in the hypoxic zone. From the RDA analysis, it was shown that dissolved oxygen (DO) explained most of the bacterial community variation in the redundancy analysis targeting only hypoxia zones, whereas nutrients and salinity explained most of the variation across all samples in the Changjiang Estuary. To understand the genes involved in nitrogen metabolism, an analysis of the oxidation state of nitrogen was performed. The results showed that the bacterial community in the surface layer (non-hypoxic) had more genes involved in dissimilatory nitrate reduction, assimilatory nitrate reduction, denitrification, and anammox, while that in the middle and bottom layers (hypoxic zone) had more abundant genes associated with nitrogen fixation and nitrification. Co-occurrence networks revealed that microbial assemblages in the middle and bottom layers shared more niche spaces than in the surface layer (non-hypoxic zone). The environmental heterogeneity in the hypoxic and non-hypoxic zones might be important environmental factors that determine the bacterial composition in these two zones.","2019","14","10.1371/journal.pone.0217431","me","not yet"

In the current study, soil samples from agricultural-pastoral land, crop land, and an artificial economic forest were collected from Tongliao, Siping, and Yanji, respectively. The structure and composition of bacterial and fungal communities was investigated by a next generation sequencing protocol, and soil physicochemical properties were also determined. Pair-wise analysis showed some soil parameters were significantly different between agricultural-pastoral land and crop land or forest land, while those soil parameters shared more similarities in crop land and forest land soils. Principal coordinates analysis and dissimilarity analyses jointly indicated that bacterial and fungal communities from each sampling site were quite different. Canonical correspondence analysis and a partial Mantel test showed that the community structures of bacteria and fungi were mainly affected by clay, pH, water soluble organic carbon (WSOC), and total soluble nitrogen (TN). Co-occurrence network analysis and the associated topological features revealed that the network of the bacterial community was more complex than that of the fungal community. Clay, pH, WSOC, and NH4+-N were major drivers and pH and WSOC were major factors in shaping the network of the bacterial community and the fungal community, respectively.

In temperate climates of the northern hemisphere, plant-root associated bacteria of the genus Frankia are the major nitrogen fixers in forest environments. Trees belonging to the genus Alnus are the most widespread hosts of Frankia in the Pacific Northwest, and a myriad of biotic and abiotic factors can influence the robustness of this symbiosis. Host identity and bacterial strain are important features that can impact Alnus-Frankia association, but little is known about the interplay of intrageneric hosts that co-occur in natural settings. In this study we investigated the genetic diversity and host specificity of Frankia bacteria associated with sympatrically occurring populations of Alnus rubra (red alder) and Alnus rhombifolia (white alder) in Oregon. Based on sequence analysis of the nifty gene recovered from mot nodules we found low overall bacterial diversity. One dominant Frankia genotype was associated with both host species, indicating a lack of strong host specificity in this system. Our results suggest that certain intrageneric plant hosts with overlapping distributions show cross-compatibility with symbiotic actinorhizal bacteria, and that low strain diversity of these bacteria can persist across mixed host populations.","2019","93","10.3955/046.093.0307","me","not yet"

Of the 807 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) observed, Chlorophyta and Charophyta were the groups with greater abundance. Beta diversity was high, and the similarity of communities decreased as the geographic distance increased. We found a shared explanation between environmental and spatial predictors for total and autotrophic microbiota. Environmental variables influence only mixotrophic microbiota. These results suggest an OTU turnover along the floodplain and a spatially structured composition.

However, most of those retrospective studies on microorganisms in archived soils were mainly conducted through PCR-DGGE or T-RFLP analysis, which was less sensitive to low-abundance species. In order to assess whether archived soils could reveal the spatial distribution of microbial communities at large spatial scale, especially the rare microbial taxa, a total of 117 serial time-historical samples from eight long-term field experimental stations of the Chinese Ecosystem Research Network were analyzed using high-throughput sequencing. The non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analyses showed that both the total bacterial communities and the rare bacterial subcommunities were distinctly clustered into different groups corresponding to each experimental station, and that analogous distribution patterns of bacterial communities existed between each two sampling years for both the total and the rare taxa, though the microbial community composition changed over time. The corresponding hierarchical clustering analyses demonstrated that soil bacterial communities for both the total and the rare taxa could be clustered into five groups for all samples and for the sub-samples of each sampling year, which corresponded to five eco-geographic regions in the Eco-Geographic Regional System of China. The results from this investigation highlighted the great value of serial time-archived soils in revealing the spatial distribution patterns of bacterial communities for both the total and the rare taxa at large spatial scale.","2019","133","10.1016/j.soilbio.2019.02.020","me","not yet"

In contrast, microbial taxa have been almost neglected or examined without sufficient spatial coverage. Here, we examined the spatial distribution of soil bacterial communities and their relation to local environmental gradients in ice-free regions of the maritime Antarctic. Soils in this region were dominated by Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria, which are typically found in Antarctic soils. Notably, candidate divisions AD3 and WPS-2, which rarely occur in other biomes, were found in high abundance in acidic surface soils. Soil pH and total organic carbon (TOC) were the primary drivers of the bacterial community structure and various geochemical variables also played important roles in structuring bacterial community composition. Bacterial communities were significantly correlated to measured environmental variables, most of which are spatially structured at the local spatial scale (0.5-8 km). This suggests that spatial heterogeneity of environmental factors is an important driver of shifts in bacterial communities. Although various sets of environmental variables were related to bacterial communities, a large proportion of community variation remained unexplained. This indicates that bacterial communities in Antarctic soils may be governed by other biotic or abiotic factors which are not typically measured in other biome studies.","2019","133","10.1016/j.soilbio.2019.03.011","me","not yet"

Total archaeal communities were extremely dominated by MGI and/or MGII (98.9% in average relative abundance). Niche partitioning between MGI and MGII or within each group was found across multiple environmental gradients. Selection was more important than dispersal limitation in governing biogeographic patterns of total archaeal, MGI, and MGII communities, and basic abiotic parameters (such as salinity) and inorganic/organic resources as a whole could be the main driver of selection. While homogenizing dispersal also considerably governed their biogeography. MGI-Nitrospira assemblages were speculatively responsible for complete nitrification. MGI taxa commonly had negative correlations with members of Synechococcus but positive correlations with members of eukaryotic phytoplankton, suggesting that competition or synergy between MGI and phytoplankton depends on specific MGI-phytoplankton assemblages. MGII taxa showed common associations with presumed (photo)heterotrophs including members of SAR11, SAR86, SAR406, and Candidatus Actinomarina. This study sheds light on ecological processes and drivers shaping archaeal biogeography and many strong MGI/MGII-bacterial associations across complex subtropical coastal waters. Future efforts should be made on seasonality of archaeal biogeography and biological, environmental, or ecological mechanisms underlying these statistical microbial associations.","2019","28","10.1111/mec.15105","me","not yet"

In particular, relating distribution patterns to the underlying ecological processes for plankton communities in highly dynamic ecosystems, such as river-reservoirs subjected to anthropogenic impacts, remains largely unstudied. Here, we analyzed taxonomic distribution patterns, and unraveled community assembly processes underlying the core and random bacterioplankton and microeukaryotes from a subtropical river-reservoir system. These plankton domains were modelled using the spatial abundance distributions (SpADs) of the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) as a proxy for abundant and rare taxa delineation. Both bacterioplankton and microeukaryote plankton communities exhibited significant distance-decay relationships, and samples were grouped depending on reservoir or river habitats. The neutral community model showed that 35-45% of the plankton community variation could be explained by neutral processes. The phylogenetic null model revealed that dispersal limitation accounted for the largest percentage of pairwise comparisons (42-68%), followed by environmental selection (18-25%). We concluded that similar prevalence of ecological processes acting on particular subsets of the bacterioplankton and microeukaryotes might have resulted from similar responses to environmental change, potentially induced by human activities in the watershed.","2019","11","10.3390/w11061127","me","not yet"

Here, we examined soil prokaryote communities at three elevations to explore soil prokaryote community distribution and mediation factors in Noijin Kangsang Peak, Tibetan Plateau. Results showed prokaryote community compositions differed significantly by elevations. Topsoil or subsoil prokaryote richness and Shannon diversity were significantly lower at the middle than other elevations, while significantly higher aboveground biomass (AGB) and available P (AP) were found at the middle elevation. The importance of P for both soil layers was discovered by variation partitioning analysis based on redundancy analysis, finding that soil AP and total phosphorus, interacted with pH, explained 43% the variance in topsoil prokaryote community compositions, while soil AP, as well as AGB, explained 44% in subsoil. Consistently, structural equation model also revealed that AP was a mediating factor for prokaryote community diversity. Other than plant beta diversity, soil prokaryote beta diversity positively correlated with AP difference significantly. Taken together, the distribution patterns of soil prokaryote community were distinct along elevations even in a small scale in Noijin Kangsang Peak and was likely mediated predominantly by soil AP in both topsoil and subsoil.","2019","95","10.1093/femsec/fiz076","me","not yet"

However, our understanding of the microbial community characteristics and the core components of soil microbiome in different succession scenarios of boreal forest is still limited. Here, we compared the diversity, activities and community composition of both bacteria and fungi between upland and swamp boreal forest soils. The microbial diversity and activity were remarkably lower in swamp than upland soils. The bacterial and fungal community compositions were significantly different between the swamp and upland soils. Linear Discriminant Analysis Effect Size analysis identified Firmicutes and Ascomycota as molecular markers for the swamp while Actinobacteria and Mucoromycotina for the upland. Molecular ecological networks revealed significantly less modules and putative keystone species of bacteria and fungi in swamp than in upland soils. The differences in soil microbiome profiles between the swamp and upland sites of boreal forest were attributed to soil moisture content, soil pH and nutrients.

In some cases, the purpose was to study diversity and evolution of genes that could be grouped within a mechanism of antibiotic resistance. Different protocols have been designed for detection and confirmation that a functional gene was found. In this study, we present a sequence-based screening of candidate genes encoding beta-lactamases in 14 metagenomes of Antarctic microbial mats. The samples were obtained from different sites, representing diverse biogeographic regions of maritime and continental Antarctica. A protocol was designed based on generation of Hidden Markov Models from the four beta-lactamase classes by Ambler classification, using sequences from the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD). The models were used as queries for metagenome analysis and recovered contigs were subsequently annotated using RAST. According to our analysis, 14 metagenomes analyzed contain A, B and C beta-lactamase genes. Class D genes, however, were identified in 11 metagenomes. The most abundant was class C (46.8%), followed by classes B (35.5%), A (14.2%) and D (3.5%). A considerable number of sequences formed clusters which included, in some cases, contigs from different metagenomes. These assemblies are clearly separated from reference clusters, previously identified using CARD beta-lactamase sequences. While bacterial antibiotic resistance is a major challenge of public health worldwide, our results suggest that environmental diversity of beta-lactamase genes is higher than that currently reported, although this should be complemented with gene function analysis.","2019","13","10.1007/s11783-019-1128-1","me","not yet"

Here we provide baseline data on planktonic communities of Archaea, Bacteria and microeukaryotes inside and outside (open water habitat) of three marine lakes (Kakaban, Haji Buang and Tanah Bamban) in the Berau region of Indonesia. Compositional variation was highly congruent with the major axis of variation separating open water from marine lake samples for all three domains. Planktonic Archaea mainly consisted of OTUs assigned to Euryarchaeota that were closely related to organisms in Genbank previously obtained from seawater samples. The majority of archaeal OTUs were most abundant in open water habitat with a few OTUs abundant in all habitats. Most bacterial sequences were assigned to Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria and Bacteroidetes with the percentage of Cyanobacteria highest in two of the marine lakes and lowest in the remaining lake (Tanah Bamban). In contrast to Archaea, there were a number of bacterial OTUs that were markedly more abundant in marine lake habitat. Most microeukaryote sequences were assigned to the Alveolata, Stramenopiles, Opisthokonta, Archaeplastida and Hacrobia. As was the case with Bacteria, a number of abundant microeukaryote OTUs were more abundant in marine lake habitat. Our results thus indicate similar compositional responses to the environmental conditions in marine lake habitat across the major domains of life and point to marine lakes harbouring distinct microbial communities.","2019","148","10.1016/j.seares.2019.04.001","me","not yet"

However, the mechanisms underlying the relative influences of the two processes remain elusive. This knowledge gap limits our ability to understand the effects of community assembly processes on microbial community structures and functions. To better understand community assembly mechanisms, the community dynamics of bacterial ecological groups were investigated based on niche breadths in 23 soil plots from subalpine coniferous forests on the Loess Plateau in Shanxi, China. Here, the overall community was divided into the ecological groups that corresponded to habitat generalists, other taxa and specialists. Redundancy analysis based on Bray-Curtis distances (db-RDA) and multiple regression tree (MRT) analysis indicated that soil organic carbon (SOC) was a general descriptor that encompassed the environmental gradients by which the communities responded to, because it can explain more significant variations in community diversity patterns. The three ecological groups exhibited different niche optima and degrees of specialization (i.e., niche breadths) along the SOC gradient, suggesting the presence of a gradient in tolerance for environmental heterogeneity. The inferred community assembly processes varied along the SOC gradient, wherein a transition was observed from homogenizing dispersal to variable selection that reflects increasing deterministic processes. Moreover, the ecological groups were inferred to perform different community functions that varied with community composition, structure. In conclusion, these results contribute to our understanding of the trade-offs between community assembly mechanisms and the responses of community structure and function to environmental gradients.","2019","57","10.1007/s12275-019-8373-7","me","not yet"

Community assembly processes occurring in these streams shape downstream population structure and nutrient cycles. To elucidate the development and stability of microbial communities along the length of a first- through third-order stream, fine-scale temporal and spatial sampling regimes were employed along Mc-Nutt Creek in Athens, GA, USA. 16S rRNA amplicon libraries were constructed from samples collected on a single day from 19 sites spanning the first 16.76 km of the stream. To provide context for this spatial study and evaluate temporal variability, selected sites at the streams upper, mid, and lower reaches were sampled daily for 5 days preceding and following the spatial study. In a second study, three sites at and near the creeks headwaters were sampled daily for 11 days to understand initial bacterioplankton community assembly. Both studies revealed decreasing alpha and beta diversity with increasing downstream distance. These trends were accompanied by the enrichment of a small fraction of taxa found at low abundance in headwater-proximal sites. Similar sets of taxa consistently increased in relative abundance in downstream samples over time scales ranging from 1 day to 1 year, many of which belong to clades known to be abundant in freshwater environments. These results underpin the importance of headwaters as the site of rapid in-stream selection that results in the reproducible establishment of a highly stable community of freshwater riverine bacteria. IMPORTANCE Headwater streams are critical introduction points of microbial diversity for larger connecting rivers and play key roles in the establishment of taxa that partake in in-stream nutrient cycling. We examined the microbial community composition of a first- through third-order stream using fine-scale temporal and spatial regimes. Our results show that the bacterioplankton community develops rapidly and predictably from the headwater population with increasing total stream length. Along the length of the stream, the microbial community exhibits substantial diversity loss and enriches repeatedly for select taxa across days and years, although the relative abundances of individual taxa vary over time and space. This repeated enrichment of a stable stream community likely contributes to the stability and flexibility of downstream communities.","2019","85","10.1128/AEM.00188-19","me","not yet"

To test whether biogeographic boundaries influence the diversity and composition of host-associated microbiota, we analysed the microbiomes of three species of common intertidal gastropods at two sites separated by the biogeographic boundary at Point Conception (PtC), CA, using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Our results show that each host species shows microbiome compositional specificity, even across PtC, and that alpha diversity does not change significantly across this boundary for any of the gastropod hosts. However, for two of the host species, beta diversity differs significantly across PtC, indicating that there may be multiple levels of organization of the marine gastropod microbiome. Overall, our results suggest that while biogeographic boundaries do not constrain the distribution of a core set of microbes associated with each host species, they can play a role in structuring the transient portion of the microbiome.","2019","11","10.1111/1758-2229.12743","me","not yet"

Recent studies pointed out that invasive populations from Europe harbored reduced bacterial microbiota compared to the native populations. Beside bacteria, mosquitoes also contain fungal communities that have so far been largely ignored. To investigate whether the mosquito invasion process displays a similar impact on fungal diversity, we compared the mycobiota structure of three autochthonous mosquito populations in Vietnam and six populations recently introduced in France and Madagascar. All mosquito populations host a locally structured fungal community and carry a core mycobiota dominated by yeasts. However, invasive populations from France and Madagascar harbor a lower fungal diversity compared to Vietnamese populations. These results suggest that similar factors shape the overall composition of the mosquito-associated microbiota during the invasion process as bacterial and fungal communities demonstrate a loss of diversity.

We have isolated two phages infecting Lentibacter sp. SH36, affiliated with the marine Roseobacter group, and retrieved similar phage genomes from publicly available metagenomics databases. Phylogenetic analysis placed the new phages within the Cobavirus group, in the here newly proposed genus Siovirus and subfamily Riovirinae of the Podoviridae. Gene composition and presence of direct terminal repeats in cultivated cobaviruses point toward a genome replication and packaging strategy similar to the T7 phage. Investigation of the genomes suggests that viral lysis of the cell proceeds via the canonical holin-endolysin pathway. Cobaviral hosts include members of the genera Lentibacter, Sulfitobacter and Celeribacter of the Roseobacter group within the family Rhodobacteraceae (Alphaproteobacteria). Screening more than 5,000 marine metagenomes, we found cobaviruses worldwide from temperate to tropical waters, in the euphotic zone, mainly in bays and estuaries, but also in the open ocean. The presence of cobaviruses in protist metagenomes as well as the phylogenetic neighborhood of cobaviruses in glutaredoxin and ribonucleotide reductase trees suggest that cobaviruses could infect bacteria associated with phototrophic or grazing protists.

With a combined global population of about 2.7 x 10(28) cells, they numerically dominate bacterioplankton communities in oligotrophic ocean gyres and yet they have never been grown together in vitro. Here we describe co-cultures of Prochlorococcus and SAR11 isolates representing both high- and low-light adapted clades. We examined: (1) the influence of Prochlorococcus on the growth of SAR11 and vice-versa, (2) whether Prochlorococcus can meet specific nutrient requirements of SAR11, and (3) how co-culture dynamics vary when Prochlorococcus is grown with SAR11 compared with sympatric copiotrophic bacteria. SAR11 grew 15-70% faster in co-culture with Prochlorococcus, while the growth of the latter was unaffected. When Prochlorococcus populations entered stationary phase, this commensal relationship rapidly became amensal, as SAR11 abundances decreased dramatically. In parallel experiments with copiotrophic bacteria; however, the heterotrophic partner increased in abundance as Prochlorococcus densities leveled off. The presence of Prochlorococcus was able to meet SAR11s central requirement for organic carbon, but not reduced sulfur. Prochlorococcus strain MIT9313, but not MED4, could meet the unique glycine requirement of SAR11, which could be due to the production and release of glycine betaine by MIT9313, as supported by comparative genomic evidence. Our findings also suggest, but do not confirm, that Prochlorococcus MIT9313 may compete with SAR11 for the uptake of 3-dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP). To give our results an ecological context, we assessed the relative contribution of Prochlorococcus and SAR11 genome equivalents to those of identifiable bacteria and archaea in over 800 marine metagenomes. At many locations, more than half of the identifiable genome equivalents in the euphotic zone belonged to Prochlorococcus and SAR11 - highlighting the biogeochemical potential of these two groups.","2019","13","10.1038/s41396-019-0365-4","me","not yet"

Here, we report microbial diversity in near-ground and high-altitude air above the largest ice-free Antarctic habitat, as well as that of underlying soil microbial communities. We found that persistent local airborne inputs were unable to fully explain Antarctic soil community assembly. Comparison with airborne microbial diversity from high-altitude and non-polar sources suggests that strong selection occurs during long-range atmospheric transport. The influence of selection during airborne transit and at sink locations varied between microbial phyla.

Environmental pressures on plants (wind, dust, drought, water, temperature) vary by geography and characterizing the impact of these variable pressures on phyllosphere microbiota will contribute to improved stewardship of fresh produce for both plant and human health. A higher resolution understanding of the incidence of human pathogens on food plants and co-occurring phytobiota using metagenomic approaches (metagenome tracking) may contribute to improved source attribution and risk assessment in cases where human pathogens become introduced to agro-ecologies.

One important resistome component is resistance to arsenic, a ubiquitous and toxic metalloid that can have negative and chronic consequences for human and animal health. The distribution of arsenic resistance and metabolism genes in the environment is not well understood. However, microbial communities and their resistomes mediate key transformations of arsenic that are expected to impact both biogeochemistry and local toxicity. Results: We examined the phylogenetic diversity, genomic location (chromosome or plasmid), and biogeography of arsenic resistance and metabolism genes in 922 soil genomes and 38 metagenomes. To do so, we developed a bioinformatic toolkit that includes BLAST databases, hidden Markov models and resources for gene-targeted assembly of nine arsenic resistance and metabolism genes: acr3, aioA, arsB, arsC (grx), arsC (trx), arsD, arsM, arrA, and arxA. Though arsenic-related genes were common, they were not universally detected, contradicting the common conjecture that all organisms have them. From major clades of arsenic-related genes, we inferred their potential for horizontal and vertical transfer. Different types and proportions of genes were detected across soils, suggesting microbial community composition will, in part, determine local arsenic toxicity and biogeochemistry. While arsenic-related genes were globally distributed, particular sequence variants were highly endemic (e.g., acr3), suggesting dispersal limitation. The gene encoding arsenic methylase arsM was unexpectedly abundant in soil metagenomes (median 48%), suggesting that it plays a prominent role in global arsenic biogeochemistry. Conclusions: Our analysis advances understanding of arsenic resistance, metabolism, and biogeochemistry, and our approach provides a roadmap for the ecological investigation of environmental resistomes.","2019","17","10.1186/s12915-019-0661-5","me","not yet"

Their apparent ubiquity in acidic terrestrial volcanic areas makes them ideal model organisms to study prokaryotic biogeography. Three Methylacidiphilum species isolated from distantly-separated geothermal regions in Russia, New Zealand, and Italy were previously described. We have explored the intra-taxon phylogenetic patterns of these organisms based on comparative genome analyses and phenotypic comparisons with six new Verrucomicrobia methanotroph isolates from other globally-separated acidic geothermal locations. Comparison of rRNA and particulate methane monooxygenase (pmoCAB) operon sequences indicates a close phylogenetic relationship among the new isolates as well as with the previously characterized strains. All share similar cell morphology including the presence of extensive intracellular inclusion bodies and lack of intracellular membrane systems, which are typical for proteobacterial methanotrophs. However, genome sequence comparisons and concatenated MLST-based phylogenetic analyses separate the new isolates into three distinct species-level groups. Three recently processed isolates from the Azores (each from geographically-separate hot springs within the region) and a single isolate from Iceland are highly similar, sharing more than 88% in silk genome homology with each other as well as with the previous isolate, Methylacidiphilum fumariolicum strain SoIV, from Italy.

However, two of the new isolates - one from the Yellowstone National Park (United States) and another from The Philippines - constitute separate and novel Methylacidiphilum species. There is no clear correlation between fatty acid profiles and geographic distance between origins, or any phylogenetic relationship. Serological analysis using antiserum raised against M. kamchatkense strain Kam 1 revealed large differences in the degree of cross-reactivity with no correlation with other factors. However, the genetic distance between the strains does correlate to the distance between their geographic origins and suggests a global biogeographic pattern shaped by an isolation-by-distance mechanism. These results further confirm terrestrial geothermal springs as isolated islands featuring allopatric prokaryotic speciation.","2019","10","10.3389/fmicb.2019.01129","me","not yet"

Nonetheless, many factors relating to this highly influential dispersal mechanisms remain unresolved, including the variation in dispersal bacterial communities during stochastic desert dust events, and the effect of aeolian transit over continental and oceanic surfaces to these communities. Here we report a temporal study that encompassed multiple dust events to elucidate 16S rRNA gene-defined changes in airborne bacterial communities at a continental-peninsula site (Yongin, central South Korea) and a downwind offshore island site (Yonago, Honshu Island, Japan) both lying along the trajectory for dust event transport. Aerosol collected on nondust days at both sites generally reflected local origin from freshwater, marine, plant, and animal sources. At both sites, the relative abundance of spore-forming bacteria (Bacillaceae) and organic-aggregating bacteria (Cytophagaceae) was positively correlated with the mineral particle. Actinobacteria increased in relative abundance at the continental-peninsula site during dust events, while marine bacterial signatures (mainly Alphaproteobacteria) were more prevalent in island site after dust events dissipated upon Japanese Sea. Overall, dust events increased the richness of airborne bacteria communities originating from inland desert and other area during early spring and are associated with more variations in airborne bacteria in the island site than the continental-peninsula site. Airborne desert dust is likely a significant transport vehicle for bacteria. The transit of air masses over continental and marine surfaces is selective for some taxa which can be transported to distant sinks with potential impacts toward ecosystems and public health. Plain Language Summary This is the first long-term study for demonstrating microbial transport from desert storms, at the continent-to-island scale. The high throughput approach provides robust support for the key findings: (a) the diversities of airborne bacteria increased with dust dispersals from Chinese desert to the Japanese coast; (b) bacterial taxa include markers associated with desert microbial communities as well as human and plant pathogens were detected; and (c) transit over oceanic waters and anthropogenic polluted areas strongly selects for airborne bacterial populations through atmospheric stressors. These findings have broad relevance to understanding the drivers of global microbial biogeography. The issue of large range microbial transport has a wide-ranging appeal in several areas including microbial ecology, oceanography (ocean-atmospheric interactions), and public health (epidemiology of pathogens).","2019","124","10.1029/2018JD029597","me","not yet"

Nevertheless, the diversity of topics explored, and those not well explored, has not been systematically assessed. We conducted a systematic review of the published scientific literature in disease ecology of mammals and subjected the collection of original and review articles identified to a topic modeling approach, which is based on the words used in the published texts and their contexts (i.e., the frequency and strength of their semantic relationships with one another). In addition to concept maps identifying the most prominent research themes, we identified eight (not mutually exclusive) subcategories of studies, including experimental, theoretical, comparative, behavioral, immunological-microbiological, biogeographic-macroecological, vector-focused (e.g., mosquitoes), and disturbance-focused. The most prominent themes arising in review papers included the ecology of zoonotic diseases transmitted from non-human mammals, comparisons of pathogen prevalence between mammalian species, and pathogen discovery-disease surveillance studies, particularly of marine mammals and bats. For the original articles, the most prominent themes included ecology of rodent-transmitted viral and bacterial diseases and the population biology of zoonotic hosts. Most studies used comparative or descriptive approaches to investigate mammal-pathogen-disease relationships at a local scale, focusing on vector-borne diseases. Experimental, modeling, immunological, and behavioral approaches were strikingly underrepresented. Topics of strong conceptual importance, but that are underrepresented in the current literature, include: 1) the effects of the population density of mammalian hosts, and manipulations of density, on pathogen transmission; 2) macroecological studies that quantify effects of mammalian host species on parasite abundance and prevalence; and 3) effects of climate change on physiological and behavioral processes relevant to mammal-parasite interactions.","2019","100","10.1093/jmammal/gyy174","me","not yet"

However, distributions of parasitic species have not been comprehensively compared in this context. We investigated which factors most influence the geographical extent of mammal parasites. Using the Global Mammal Parasite Database we analysed 17 818 individual geospatial records on 1806 parasite species (encompassing viruses, bacteria, protozoa, arthropods and helminths) that infect 396 carnivore, ungulate and primate host species. As a measure of the geographical extent of each parasite species we quantified the number and area of world ecoregions occupied by each. To evaluate the importance of variables influencing the summed area of ecoregions occupied by a parasite species, we used Bayesian network analysis of a subset (n = 866) of the parasites in our database that had at least two host species and complete information on parasite traits. We found that parasites that covered more geographical area had a greater number of host species, higher average phylogenetic relatedness between host species and more sampling effort. Host and parasite taxonomic groups had weak and indirect effects on parasite ecoregion area; parasite transmission mode had virtually no effect. Mechanistically, a greater number of host species probably increases both the collective abundance and habitat breadth of hosts, providing more opportunities for a parasite to have an expansive range. Furthermore, even though mammals are one of the best-studied animal classes, the ecoregion area occupied by their parasites is strongly sensitive to sampling effort, implying mammal parasites are undersampled. Overall, our results support that parasite geographical extent is largely controlled by host characteristics, many of which are subsumed within host taxonomic identity.","2019","286","10.1098/rspb.2019.0673","me","not yet"

Advances in next-generation sequencing have opened new frontiers for discovery programmes for natural products allowing the exploitation of a larger fraction of the microbial community. Polyketide (PK) and non-ribosomal pepetide (NRP) natural products have been reported to be related to compounds with antimicrobial and anticancer activities. We report here a new culture-independent approach to explore bacterial biosynthetic diversity and determine bacterial phyla in the microbial community associated with PK and NRP diversity in selected soils.ResultsThrough amplicon sequencing, we explored the microbial diversity (16S rRNA gene) of 13 soils from Antarctica, Africa, Europe and a Caribbean island and correlated this with the amplicon diversity of the adenylation (A) and ketosynthase (KS) domains within functional genes coding for non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) and polyketide synthases (PKSs), which are involved in the production of NRP and PK, respectively. Mantel and Procrustes correlation analyses with microbial taxonomic data identified not only the well-studied phyla Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria, but also, interestingly, the less biotechnologically exploited phyla Verrucomicrobia and Bacteroidetes, as potential sources harbouring diverse A and KS domains. Some soils, notably that from Antarctica, provided evidence of endemic diversity, whilst others, such as those from Europe, clustered together. In particular, the majority of the domain reads from Antarctica remained unmatched to known sequences suggesting they could encode enzymes for potentially novel PK and NRP.ConclusionsThe approach presented here highlights potential sources of metabolic novelty in the environment which will be a useful precursor to metagenomic biosynthetic gene cluster mining for PKs and NRPs which could provide leads for new antimicrobial metabolites.","2019","7","10.1186/s40168-019-0692-8","me","not yet"

Several studies have, nonetheless, revealed the importance of fungi in provisioning services to prokaryote communities. Here, we hypothesise that the fungal community plays a key role in coordinating entire microbial communities by controlling the structure of functional networks in sediment. We selected a sediment environment with high niche diversity due to prevalent macrofaunal bioturbation, namely intertidal mangrove sediment, and explored the assembly of bacteria, archaea and fungi in different sediment niches, which we characterised by biogeochemical analysis, around the burrow of a herbivorous crab. We detected a high level of heterogeneity in sediment biogeochemical conditions, and diverse niches harboured distinct communities of bacteria, fungi and archaea. Saprotrophic fungi were a pivotal component of microbial networks throughout and we invariably found fungi to act as keystone species in all the examined niches and possibly acting synergistically with other environmental variables to determine the overall microbial community structure. In consideration of the importance of microbial-based nutrient cycling on overall sediment ecosystem functioning, we underline that the fungal microbiome and its role in the functional interactome cannot be overlooked.","2019","9","10.1038/s41598-019-43980-3","me","not yet"

Characterizing the global distribution of these symbioses and identifying the factors that control this distribution are thus integral to understanding the present and future functioning of forest ecosystems. Here we generate a spatially explicit global map of the symbiotic status of forests, using a database of over 1.1 million forest inventory plots that collectively contain over 28,000 tree species. Our analyses indicate that climate variables-in particular, climatically controlled variation in the rate of decomposition-are the primary drivers of the global distribution of major symbioses. We estimate that ectomycorrhizal trees, which represent only 2% of all plant species(7), constitute approximately 60% of tree stems on Earth. Ectomycorrhizal symbiosis dominates forests in which seasonally cold and dry climates inhibit decomposition, and is the predominant form of symbiosis at high latitudes and elevation. By contrast, arbuscular mycorrhizal trees dominate in aseasonal, warm tropical forests, and occur with ectomycorrhizal trees in temperate biomes in which seasonally warm-and-wet climates enhance decomposition. Continental transitions between forests dominated by ectomycorrhizal or arbuscular mycorrhizal trees occur relatively abruptly along climate-driven decomposition gradients; these transitions are probably caused by positive feedback effects between plants and microorganisms. Symbiotic nitrogen fixers-which are insensitive to climatic controls on decomposition (compared with mycorrhizal fungi)-are most abundant in arid biomes with alkaline soils and high maximum temperatures. The climatically driven global symbiosis gradient that we document provides a spatially explicit quantitative understanding of microbial symbioses at the global scale, and demonstrates the critical role of microbial mutualisms in shaping the distribution of plant species.","2019","569","10.1038/s41586-019-1128-0","me","not yet"
"Zumstein, MT; Helbling, DE","Biotransformation of antibiotics: Exploring the activity of extracellular and intracellular enzymes derived from wastewater microbial communities","WATER RESEARCH","Evaluating the activity of extracellular and intracellular enzymes derived from wastewater microbial communities is essential to improve our fundamental understanding of micropollutant removal during wastewater treatment. To study biotransformations with respect to enzyme biogeography, we developed a method to separate soluble extracellular, extracellular polymeric substance (EPS)-bound, and intracellular enzymes from wastewater microbial communities and assessed the protease and peptidase activity of the resulting enzyme pools. We also evaluated the biotransformation of six antibiotics (amoxicillin, ampicillin, clindamycin, daptomycin, linezolid, and vancomycin) in each enzyme pool because we expect that the kinetics, pathways, and biogeography of antibiotic biotransformations influence the selection of antibiotic resistance within wastewater microbial communities and in downstream environments. Our results demonstrated that biotransformation rate constants varied among the tested antibiotics, and that the observed rank order was consistent across three wastewater treatment plants. Importantly, many of the observed biotransformations eliminated the functional groups associated with antibiotic activity. Furthermore, we found that beta-lactam hydrolysis and daptomycin hydrolysis were catalyzed by enzymes extracted from the EPS, while none of the tested antibiotics were biotransformed by soluble extracellular enzymes. Finally, our results demonstrated that the number of enzyme-catalyzed antibiotic transformations was larger for intracellular than for extracellular enzymes. Together, this study provides novel insights on the kinetics, pathways, and biogeography of antibiotic biotransformations performed by wastewater microbial communities and can be used to inform pathway prediction or the development of biodegradable chemicals.

We found that the homogeneity of the ectomycorrhizal fungal community increased with increasing tree death, aboveground understory productivity and diversity. Whereas, the independent effect of fine root biomass, which declined along the same gradient of tree mortality, increased the heterogeneity of the ectomycorrhizal fungal community.

Here, three replicate bioreactors were used to investigate microbial succession during the formation of granular biofilms. We identified three successional phases. During the initial phase, the successional turnover was high and alpha-diversity decreased as a result of the selection of taxa adapted to grow on acetate and form aggregates. Despite these dynamic changes, the microbial communities in the replicate reactors were similar. The second successional phase occurred when the settling time was rapidly decreased to selectively retain granules in the reactors. The influence of stochasticity on succession increased and new niches were created as granules emerged, resulting in temporarily increased alpha-diversity. The third successional phase occurred when the settling time was kept stable and granules dominated the biomass. Turnover was low, and selection resulted in the same abundant taxa in the reactors, but drift, which mostly affected low-abundant community members, caused the community in one reactor to diverge from the other two.

The variation in null deviations and phylogenetic analysis showed that a continuum existed between deterministic and stochastic processes in shaping the microbial community structure, but deterministic processes prevailed. By integrating the results of redundancy analysis (RDA), multiple regression tree (MRT) analysis and correlation analysis, we found that soil organic carbon (SOC) was the main driver of the community structure and diversity patterns.

The dormant endospore phenotype confers resistance to unfavorable environmental conditions, allowing dispersal to be isolated and studied independently of other factors such as environmental selection. To study the resilience of thermospores to conditions relevant for survival in extreme cold conditions, their viability following different freezing treatments was tested. Marine sediment was frozen at either -80 degrees C or -20 degrees C for 10 days prior to pasteurization and incubation at +50 degrees C for 21 days to assess thermospore viability. Sulfate reduction commenced at +50 degrees C following both freezing pretreatments indicating persistence of thermophilic endospores of sulfate-reducing bacteria. The onset of sulfate reduction at +50 degrees C was delayed in -80 degrees C pretreated microcosms, which exhibited more variability between triplicates, compared to -20 degrees C pretreated microcosms and parallel controls that were not frozen in advance. Microbial communities were evaluated by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, revealing an increase in the relative sequence abundance of thermophilic endospore-forming Firmicutes in all microcosms. Different freezing pretreatments (-80 degrees C and -20 degrees C) did not appreciably influence the shift in overall bacterial community composition that occurred during the +50 degrees C incubations. Communities that had been frozen prior to +50 degrees C incubation showed an increase in the relative sequence abundance of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) affiliated with the class Bacilli, relative to unfrozen controls. These results show that freezing impacts but does not obliterate thermospore populations and their ability to germinate and grow under appropriate conditions. Indeed the majority of the thermospore OTUs detected in this study (21 of 22) could be observed following one or both freezing treatments. These results are important for assessing thermospore viability in frozen samples and following cold exposure such as the very low temperatures that would be encountered during panspermia.","2019","10","10.3389/fmicb.2019.00945","me","not yet"

"Kumar, A; Sperandio, V","Indole Signaling at the Host-Microbiota-Pathogen Interface","MBIO","Microbial establishment within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract requires surveillance of the gut biogeography. The gut microbiota coordinates behaviors by sensing host-or microbiota-derived signals. Here we show for the first time that microbiota-derived indole is highly prevalent in the lumen compared to the intestinal tissue. This difference in indole concentration plays a key role in modulating virulence gene expression of the enteric pathogens enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) and Citrobacter rodentium. Indole decreases expression of genes within the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) pathogenicity island, which is essential for these pathogens to form attaching and effacing (AE) lesions on enterocytes. We synthetically altered the concentration of indole in the GI tracts of mice by employing mice treated with antibiotics to deplete the microbiota and reconstituted with indole-producing commensal Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (B. theta) or a B. theta Delta tnaA mutant (does not produce indole) or by engineering an indole-producing C. rodentium strain. This allowed us to assess the role of self-produced versus microbiota-produced indole, and the results show that decreased indole concentrations promote bacterial pathogenesis, while increased levels of indole decrease bacterial virulence gene expression. Moreover, we identified the bacterial membranebound histidine sensor kinase (HK) CpxA as an indole sensor. Enteric pathogens sense a gradient of indole concentrations in the gut to probe different niches and successfully establish an infection. IMPORTANCE Pathogens sense and respond to several small molecules within the GI tract to modulate expression of their virulence repertoire. Indole is a signaling molecule produced by the gut microbiota. Here we show that indole concentrations are higher in the lumen, where the microbiota is present, than in the intestinal tissue. The enteric pathogens EHEC and C. rodentium sense indole to downregulate expression of their virulence genes, as a read-out of the luminal compartment. We also identified the bacterial membrane-bound HK CpxA as an indole sensor. This regulation ensures that EHEC and C. rodentium express their virulence genes only at the epithelial lining, which is the niche they colonize.","2019","10","10.1128/mBio.01031-19","me","not yet"

Developing a better understanding of its diversity and distributions is an ongoing effort in biological oceanography. Here, we introduce 12 new draft genomes of marine Synechococcus isolates spanning five clades and utilize similar to 100 environmental metagenomes largely sourced from the TARA Oceans project to assess the global distributions of the genomic lineages they and other reference genomes represent. We show that five newly provided clade-II isolates are by far the most representative of the recovered in situ populations (most abundant) and have biogeographic distributions distinct from previously available clade-II references. Additionally, these isolates form a subclade possessing the smallest genomes yet identified of the genus (2.14 +/- 0.05Mbps; mean +/- 1SD) while concurrently hosting some of the highest GC contents (60.67 +/- 0.16%). This is in direct opposition to the pattern in Synechococcuss nearest relative, Prochlorococcus - wherein decreasing genome size has coincided with a strong decrease in GC content - suggesting this new subclade of Synechococcus appears to have convergently undergone genomic reduction relative to the rest of the genus, but along a fundamentally different evolutionary trajectory.","2019","21","10.1111/1462-2920.14552","me","not yet"
"Suzuki, TA; Martins, FM; Nachman, MW","Altitudinal variation of the gut microbiota in wild house mice","MOLECULAR ECOLOGY","The maintenance of oxygen homeostasis in the gut is critical for the maintenance of a healthy gut microbiota. However, few studies have explored how the concentration of atmospheric oxygen affects the gut microbiota in natural populations. High-altitude environments provide an opportunity to study the potential effects of atmospheric oxygen on the composition and function of the gut microbiota. Here, we characterized the caecal microbial communities of wild house mice (Mus musculus domesticus) in two independent altitudinal transects, one in Ecuador and one in Bolivia, from sea level to nearly 4,000 m. First, we found that differences in altitude were associated with differences in the gut microbial community after controlling for the effects of body mass, diet, reproductive status and population of origin. Second, obligate anaerobes tended to show a positive correlation with altitude, while all other microbes tended to show a negative correlation with altitude. These patterns were seen independently in both transects, consistent with the expected effects of atmospheric oxygen on gut microbes. Prevotella was the most-enriched genus at high elevations in both transects, consistent with observations in high-altitude populations of pikas, ruminants and humans, and also consistent with observations of laboratory mice exposed to hypoxic conditions. Lastly, the renin-angiotensin system, a recently proposed microbiota-mediated pathway of blood pressure regulation, was the top predicted metagenomic pathway enriched in high altitudes in both transects. These results suggest that high-altitude environments affect the composition and function of the gut microbiota in wild mammals.","2019","28","10.1111/mec.14905","me","not yet"
"Mainali, K; Bewick, S; Vecchio-Pagan, B; Karig, D; Fagan, WF","Detecting interaction networks in the human microbiome with conditional Granger causality","PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY","Human microbiome research is rife with studies attempting to deduce microbial correlation networks from sequencing data. Standard correlation and/or network analyses may be misleading when taken as an indication of taxon interactions because correlation is neither necessary nor sufficient to establish causation; environmental filtering can lead to correlation between non-interacting taxa. Unfortunately, microbial ecologists have generally used correlation as a proxy for causality although there is a general consensus about what constitutes a causal relationship: causes both precede and predict effects. We apply one of the first causal models for detecting interactions in human microbiome samples. Specifically, we analyze a long duration, high resolution time series of the human microbiome to decipher the networks of correlation and causation of human-associated microbial genera. We show that correlation is not a good proxy for biological interaction; we observed a weak negative relationship between correlation and causality. Strong interspecific interactions are disproportionately positive, whereas almost all strong intraspecific interactions are negative. Interestingly, intraspecific interactions also appear to act at a short timescale causing vast majority of the effects within 1-3 days. We report how different taxa are involved in causal relationships with others, and show that strong interspecific interactions are rarely conserved across two body sites whereas strong intraspecific interactions are much more conserved, ranging from 33% between the gut and right-hand to 70% between the two hands. Therefore, in the absence of guiding assumptions about ecological interactions, Granger causality and related techniques may be particularly helpful for understanding the driving factors governing microbiome composition and structure. Author summary The human microbiome comprises thousands of microbial taxa, each of them potentially having interactions with many other taxa. Elucidating these interactions can be helpful for human health and beyond. The most conclusive approach for understanding microbial interactions would be myriads of controlled experiments in laboratory settings, each designed to test how taxa interact with one another. As this is a formidable challenge, an alternative strategy for constructing such an interaction network is a statistical framework employing formal models. Using conditional Granger causality, we demonstrate that correlation measures, which are very popular statistics in microbiome studies, are unreliable as proxies of microbial interactions. Overall, we found that strong interactions within a genus tended to be negative (e.g., competition), and they tended to occur on very short timescales (1-2 days). Many of such interactions were common across body sites. By contrast, strong interactions between genera tended to be positive (e.g., mutualism/facilitation) and were more evenly distributed over a range of timescales, up to the 20-day window that we considered. Very few of these interactions were conserved across body sites. We conclude that models of causality can be particularly useful in elucidating microbial interaction networks when laboratory investigations of interactions are impractical.","2019","15","10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007037","me","not yet"

Drought is the major stress in this region which limits productivity. Microbial communities in the rhizosphere are of special importance to stress tolerance. However, relatively little is known about the relationship between drought and microbial communities in peanuts. Method: In this study, deep sequencing of the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was performed to characterize the microbial community structure of drought-treated and untreated peanuts. Results: Taxonomic analysis showed that Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Saccharibacteria, Chloroflexi, Acidobacteria and Cyanobacteria were the dominant phyla in the peanut rhizosphere. Comparisons of microbial community structure of peanuts revealed that the relative abundance of Actinobacteria and Acidobacteria dramatically increased in the seedling and podding stages in drought-treated soil, while that of Cyanobacteria and Gemmatimonadetes increased in the flowering stage in drought-treated rhizospheres. Metagenomic profiling indicated that sequences related to metabolism, signaling transduction, defense mechanism and basic vital activity were enriched in the drought-treated rhizosphere, which may have implications for plant survival and drought tolerance. Conclusion: This microbial communities study will form the foundation for future improvement of drought tolerance of peanuts via modification of the soil microbes.","2019","20","10.3390/ijms20092265","me","not yet"

We then assessed the composition and diversity of bacterial taxa in the soils using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. The addition of the regional microbial pool did not cause significant changes in the overall composition or diversity of the total bacterial community, although a very small number of individual taxa may have been affected by the addition treatment.

We investigated (Illumina MiSeq) snow-borne bacterial, fungal, and algal communities across a latitudinal gradient in Fennoscandia and inter-continental distribution between northern Europe and North America. Our data indicate that bacterial communities are ubiquitous regionally (across Fennoscandia), whereas fungal communities are regionally heterogeneous. Both fungi and bacteria are biogeographically heterogeneous inter-continentally. Snow algae, generally thought to occur in colorful algae blooms (red, green, or yellow) on the snow surface, are molecularly described here as an important component of snows even in absence of visible algal growth. This suggests that snow algae are a previously underestimated major biological component of visually uncolonized snows. In contrast to fungi and bacteria, algae exhibit no discernible inter-continental or regional community structure and exhibit little endemism. These results indicate that global and regional snow microbial communities and their distributions may be dictated by a combination of size-limited propagule dispersal potential and restrictions (bacteria and fungi) and homogenization of ecologically specialized taxa (snow algae) across the globe. These results are among the first to compare inter-continental snow microbial communities and highlight how poorly understood microbial communities in these threatened ephemeral ecosystems are.","2019","77","10.1007/s00248-019-01357-z","me","not yet"

Bacterioplankton community structures from nine global estuaries were compared to understand their broad-scale biogeographic patterns. Bacterioplankton community structure from four estuaries of Sundarbans, namely Mooriganga, Thakuran, Matla, and Harinbhanga, was elucidated using Illumina sequencing. Bacterioplankton communities from these estuaries were compared against available bacterioplankton sequence data from Columbia, Delaware, Jiulong, Pearl, and Hangzhou estuaries. All nine estuaries were dominated by Proteobacteria. Other abundant phyla included Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Planctomycetes, and Verrucomicrobia. The abundant bacterial phyla showed a ubiquitous presence across the estuaries. At class level, the overwhelming abundance of Gammaproteobacteria in the estuaries of Sundarbans and Columbia estuary clearly stood out amidst high abundance of Alphaproteobacteria observed in the other estuaries. Abundant bacterial families including Rhodobacteriaceae, Shingomonadaceae, Acidobacteriaceae, Vibrionaceae, and Xanthomondaceae also showed ubiquitous presence in the studied estuaries. However, rare taxa including Chloroflexi, Tenericutes, Nitrospirae, and Deinococcus-Thermus showed clear site-specific distribution patterns. Such distribution patterns were also reinstated by nMDS ordination plots. Such clustering patterns could hint toward the potential role of environmental parameters and substrate specificity which could result in distinct bacterioplankton communities at specific sites. The ubiquitous presence of abundant bacterioplankton groups along with their strong correlation with surface water temperature and dissolved nutrient concentrations indicates the role of such environmental parameters in shaping bacterioplankton community structure in estuaries. Overall, studies on biogeographic patters of bacterioplankton communities can provide interesting insights into ecosystem functioning and health of global estuaries.","2019","8","10.1002/mbo3.741","me","not yet"

In this study, metagenomics sequencing and analysis were applied to investigate the ARG pattern in 12 drinking water sources in upper and middle reach of Huaihe River Basin, China. Based on the redundant analysis and multi-linear regression model, location, specific microbial taxa, number of livestock and health facilities significantly influenced the ARG profile in drinking water sources. Besides the cluster effect of ARG in samples from plain and bedrock mountain areas, the samples from fracture aquifer areas also showed a distinctive biogeographic pattern with that from porous aquifer areas. Putative ARGs host Opitutus and Flavobacterium were the enriched biomarkers in plain and fracture aquifer area respectively, which mainly carried bacitracin, multidrug, beta-lactam and tetracycline ARGs. This result illuminated that both natural background and anthropogenic activities in the watershed influenced the ARG profile in natural freshwater system significantly. The low MGEs abundance and absence of pathogen revealed a low ARG dissemination risk in sampled drinking water sources, while Polynucleobacter was an abundant ARGs host and was significantly related to the ARG profile, which indicated that specific bacteria was responsible for ARGs propagation and accumulation in surface freshwater system. Further researches are needed to assess human exposure to raw drinking water source and the potential risk, as well as the species interaction in microbial community and its impact on ARG propagation under oligotrophic condition.

During the 2015 austral summer season, we collected samples to measure the metabolic composition of snow algae communities and determined the species composition of these communities using metabarcoding. Green communities were protein-rich, had a high chlorophyll content and contained many metabolites associated with nitrogen and amino acid metabolism. Red communities had a higher carotenoid content and contained more metabolites associated with carbohydrate and fatty acid metabolism. Chloromonas, Chlamydomonas and Chlorella were found in green blooms but only Chloromonas was detected in red blooms. Both communities also contained bacteria, protists and fungi.

Most studies use fecal samples as a proxy for the intestinal microbiota; however, the fecal microbiome is not fully representative of the mucosa-associated microbiota at the site of disease. While mucosal biopsies can be used instead, they often contain a high proportion of host DNA that can confound 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing studies. METHODS: To overcome these limitations, we sampled the mucosal-luminal interface (MLI) to study the mucosa-associated microbiota. We also employed a simple bioinformatics workflow to remove contaminants from 16S rRNA gene profiling results. RESULTS: Our results indicate that the microbial differences between individuals are greater than those between different microenvironments within the same individual. Moreover, biopsy samples frequently contained contaminants that could significantly impact biopsy profiling results. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the utility of collecting MLI aspirates to complement biopsies and stools for characterizing human microbial communities.","2019","85","10.1038/s41390-019-0326-7","me","not yet"

Here, we use a trait-based approach to quantify the niches of 23 species of basidiomycete wood decay fungi from across North America, and explore the linkages among functional trait expression, climate and phylogeny. Our analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off between abiotic stress tolerance and competitive ability, whereby fungi with wide thermal and moisture niches exhibit lower displacement ability. The magnitude of this dominance-tolerance trade-off is partially related to the environmental conditions under which the fungi were collected, with thermal niche traits exhibiting the strongest climate relationships. Nevertheless, moisture and thermal dominance-tolerance patterns exhibited contrasting phylogenetic signals, suggesting that these trends are influenced by a combination of niche sorting along taxonomic lines in tandem with acclimation and adaptation at the level of the individual.

A coloniser of low nutrient (N) soils, it supports biodiversity such as key moth and butterfly species, and its roots are known for their organoleptic and claimed therapeutic properties. Thus, the species has high potential for restoration, conservation, novel cropping and as a model species. The last because of its genetic synteny with important pulse crops. However, regeneration and functional attributes of L. linifolius remain to be characterised. Seeds of L. linifolius were characterised using physical, colorimetric and chemical data. Ultrastructural and functional characterisation of the N-fixing root nodules included immunolabelling with nifH protein antibodies (recognising the N-fixing enzyme, nitrogenase). Endosymbiotic bacteria were isolated from root nodules and characterised phylogenetically using 16S rRNA, nodA and nodD gene sequences. L. linifolius yielded heteromorphic seed of distinct colour classes: green and brown. Seed morphotypes had similar C:N ratios and were equally germinable (ca. 90%) after scarification at differing optimal temperatures (16 and 20 degrees C). Brown seeds were larger and comprised a larger proportion of the seed batch (69%). L. linifolius root nodules appeared indeterminate in structure, effective (capable of fixing atmospheric N) and having strains very similar to Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar viciae. The findings and rhizobial isolates have potential application for ecological restoration and horticulture using native seeds. Also, the data and rhizobial resources have potential applications in comparative and functional studies with related and socio-economically important crops such as Pisum, Lens and Vicia.","2019","21","10.1111/plb.12902","me","not yet"

At five sites in the Atlantic Ocean, we investigated the processing of organic matter by tracking changes in microbial community composition as HMW polysaccharides were enzymatically hydrolysed over time. During this investigation, we discovered that a considerable fraction of heterotrophic bacteria uses a newly-identified selfish mode of substrate processing. We therefore additionally examined the balance of individual substrate utilisation mechanisms at different locations by linking individual microorganisms to distinct substrate utilisation mechanisms. Through FISH and uptake of fluorescently-labelled polysaccharides, selfish organisms were identified as belonging to the Bacteroidetes, Planctomycetes and Gammaproteobacteria. Sharing (extracellular enzyme producing) and scavenging (non-enzyme producing) organisms predominantly belonged to the Alteromonadaceae and SAR11 clades, respectively. The extent to which individual mechanisms prevail depended on the initial population structure of the bacterial community at a given location and time, as well as the growth rate of specific bacteria. Furthermore, the same substrate was processed in different ways by different members of a pelagic microbial community, pointing to significant follow-on effects for carbon cycling.","2019","13","10.1038/s41396-018-0326-3","me","not yet"

However, the links between soil microbial communities, soil abiotic properties, plant functional traits in the case of semi-arid and arid ecosystems, are unclear. In this study, we investigated the changes in soil microbial species diversity and community composition, and the corresponding effects of soil abiotic properties and plant functional traits, during a >= 150-year secondary forest succession on the Loess Plateau, which represents a typical semi-arid ecosystem in China. Plant community fragments were assigned to six successional stages: 1-4, 4-8, 8-15, 15-50, 50-100, and 100-150 years after abandonment. Bacterial and fungal communities were analyzed by high-throughput sequencing of the V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS2) region of the rRNA operon, respectively. A multivariate variation-partitioning approach was used to estimate the contributions of soil properties and plant traits to the observed microbial community composition. We found considerable differences in bacterial and fungal community compositions between the early (S1-S3) and later (S4-S6) successional stages. In total, 18 and 12 unique families were, respectively, obtained for bacteria and fungi, as indicators of microbial community succession across the six stages. Bacterial alpha diversity was positively correlated with plant species alpha diversity, while fungal diversity was negatively correlated with plant species diversity. Certain fungal and bacterial taxa appeared to be associated with the occurrence of dominant plant species at different successional stages. Soil properties (pH, total N, total C, NH4-N, NO3-N, and PO4-P concentrations) and plant traits explained 63.80% and 56.68% of total variance in bacterial and fungal community compositions, respectively. These results indicate that soil microbial communities are coupled with plant communities via the mediation of microbial species diversity and community composition over a long-term secondary forest succession in the semi-arid ecosystem. The bacterial and fungal communities show distinct patterns in response to plant community succession, according to both soil abiotic properties and plant functional traits.","2019","10","10.3389/fmicb.2019.00895","me","not yet"

Sampling across a hybrid zone allowed us to additionally test whether phylosymbiosis (codiversification between hosts and their microbiota) is detectable in admixed, closely related primates. We found little evidence of genetic effects: none of host genetic ancestry, host genetic relatedness nor genetic distance between host populations were strong predictors of baboon gut microbiota. Instead, gut microbiota were best explained by the baboons environments, especially the soils geologic history and exchangeable sodium. Indeed, soil effects were 15 times stronger than those of host-population F-ST, perhaps because soil predicts which foods are present, or because baboons are terrestrial and consume soil microbes incidentally with their food. Our results support an emerging picture in which environmental variation is the dominant predictor of host-associated microbiomes.

For the most part Aa conducts its business by utilizing strategies allowing it to conceal itself below the radar of the host mucosal immune defense system. A great deal of misinformation has been conveyed with respect to Aa biology in health and disease. The purpose of this review is to present misconceptions about Aa and the strategies that it uses to colonize, survive, and evade the host. In the process Aa manages to undermine host mucosal defenses and contribute to disease initiation. This review will present clinical observational, molecular, and interventional studies that illustrate genetic, phenotypic, and biogeographical tactics that have been recently clarified and demonstrate how Aa survives and suppresses host mucosal defenses to take part in disease pathogenesis. At one point in time Aa was considered to be the causative agent of Localized Aggressive Periodontitis. Currently, it is most accurate to look at Aa as a community activist and necessary partner of a pathogenic consortium that suppresses the initial host response so as to encourage overgrowth of its partners. The data for Aa s activist role stems from molecular genetic studies complemented by experimental animal investigations that demonstrate how Aa establishes a habitat (housing), nutritional sustenance in that habitat (food), and biogeographical mobilization and/or relocation from its initial habitat (transportation). In this manner Aa can transfer to a protected but vulnerable domain (pocket or sulcus) where its community activism is most useful. Aas strategy includes obtaining housing, food, and transportation at no cost to its partners challenging the economic theory that there aint no such thing as a free lunch. This strategy illustrates how co-evolution can promote Ms survival, on one hand, and overgrowth of community members, on the other, which can result in local host dysbiosis and susceptibility to infection.","2019","10","10.3389/fimmu.2019.00728","me","not yet"

The aim of this work was to determine the effects of the successive planting of E. urophylla on soil characteristics. Five different stands, including 5-, 10-, 15-, and 18-year-old E. urophylla plantations (abbreviated as 5yr, 10yr, 15yr, and 18yr, respectively) and one native evergreen broadleaf forest as a 0-year-old E. urophylla plantation (abbreviated as CK) were used. All of measured chemical indicators, microbial biomass, and enzyme activities were significantly lower in E. urophylla plantations compared with CK stand. The microbial biomass and enzyme activities significantly decreased in 5yr stand, significantly increased in 10yr stand, and subsequently declined in 15yr and 18yr stands. The relative abundance of Ascomycota in 15yr (77.10%) and 18yr (72.71%) plantations was significantly higher than in other stands. Basidiomycota relative abundance in the E. urophylla plantations was significantly lower than in the CK stand. In addition, the bacterial diversity was significantly decreased in 15yr and 18yr stands, whereas the fungal diversity was the lowest in 5yr stand and significantly increased in 10yr, 15yr, and 18yr stands. Furthermore, structural equation modelling showed that successive planting of E. urophylla decreased the soil bacterial community diversity, microbial biomass, and enzyme activity but increased the fungal community diversity. Thus, successive planting of E. urophylla negatively influenced the soil bacterial diversity, microbial biomass, and enzyme activity and positively influenced soil fungal diversity.","2019","30","10.1002/ldr.3249","me","not yet"

In-situ monitoring and 18S rRNA gene sequencing were used to investigate spatiotemporal variations of eukaryotic community in three types of watershed with different dominant land use type (i.e. urban, forest, and natural) during three seasons (i.e. dry, transition, and wet seasons) in a coastal watershed of Southeast China. Results showed that agricultural and urban watersheds had significantly higher diversity in dry and transition seasons, and higher richness in transition and wet seasons than those in forest watershed. The non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis further verified great spatiotemporal variations of eukaryotic community. Stramenopiles, Alveolata, Animalia, and Eukaryota, dominated the sequences reads for all sampling sites in three seasons. Agricultural watershed had the highest relative abundant of Animalia, whereas Eukaryota was the most abundant in urban watershed and forest watershed had the highest relative abundance of Stramenopiles and Alveolata. The RDA ordination showed that Builtup and streamflow were two most important factors for moderate taxa and abundant taxa, respectively. Variation partitioning revealed that land use pattern and hydrological regime together explained 54.4%, 61% and 67.2% variances of the composition of eukaryotic community. Among three sampling seasons, the relative contribution of land use pattern was higher than that of hydrological regime. The results of this investigation demonstrated how land use pattern and hydrological regime affected the composition and diversity of riverine eukaryotic community. The findings can provide a useful insight into the riverine eukaryotic communities and their underlying ecological mechanisms in coastal China watersheds. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, factors determining variations in fungal diversity and their biogeographic patterns in this rigorously affected landscape area remain poorly understood. Therefore, we performed Illumina MiSeq high throughput sequencing of the fungal specific, internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) region from 24 representative soils covering forest, grassland and agricultural lands from 8 distinct landscapes. Using this technique, we demonstrate that fungal members belonging to phylum Ascomycota dominated in all soils investigated in this study with an average relative abundance higher than 80%. High fungal richness in the Loess Plateau soils is ascribed to the retrieval of 1,822,499 quality sequences belonging to 13,533 different phylotypes. However, this richness/phylotype number decreased (from 779 to 561) with increasing longitudinal gradient through 107 degrees 39 to 109 degrees 36. Interestingly, higher fungal diversity (in terms of presence of diverse fungal taxa) occurred as microbial biomass carbon (MBC) concentration decreased (approximately from 500 to 100 mg kg(-1)) in soils. Variation partitioning analysis revealed that geographic distance contributed more to fungal community variation (38.3%) than soil properties (22.2%) at the landscape level (similar to 400 km). As indicated by non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS), among soil properties, concentrations of MBC primarily affected (significantly corrected with NMDS 1; r = 0.620; p < 0.01) fungal community structure in the current study. This study therefore constitutes an essential set of information and recommends usage of information on fungal community structure as a potential ecological indicator of the Loess Plateau region.

Caulerpa is also host to a rich diversity of bacterial endo- and epibionts. The degree to which these bacterial communities are species-, or even niche-specific remains largely unknown. To address this, we investigated the diversity of bacteria associated to different morphological niches of both native and invasive species of Caulerpa from different geographic locations along the Turkish coastline of the Aegean sea. Associated bacteria were identified using the 16S rDNA marker gene for three morphological niches, such as the endobiome, epibiome, and rhizobiome. Bacterial community structure was explored and deterministic factors behind bacterial variation were investigated. Of the total variation, only 21 .5% could be explained. Pronounced differences in bacterial community composition were observed and variation was partly explained by a combination of host species, biogeography and nutrient levels. The majority of the explained bacterial variation within the algal holobiont was attributed to the micro-environments established by distinct morphological niches. This study further supports the hypothesis that the bacterial assembly is largely stochastic in nature and bacterial community structure is most likely linked to functional genes rather than taxonomy.","2019","10","10.3389/fmicb.2019.00717","me","not yet"

Nine novel A-layer types (15-23) are identified, several of which display a strong predilection towards certain fish hosts, including e.g. Cyprinidae and Pleuronectidae species.

LocationNamib Desert gravel plains. TaxonCollembola (springtails). MethodsA total of 77 soil samples were collected along NE-SW (60km) and E-W (160km) transects from within a 4,000km(2) area of the Namib Desert gravel plains. We extracted 434 springtails from the 37 samples which contained Collembola and sequenced them at the COI gene locus. In the absence of specific taxonomic keys and previous genetic data for these taxa, we used Generalized Mixed Yule Coalescent (GMYC) analyses to provide putative species-level designations. ResultsWe obtained 341 successful COI sequences, 175 of which were unique haplotypes. GMYC analyses identified 30 putative species, with up to 28% sequence divergence (uncorrected p-distance). The distribution of genetic variants was disjunct, with 97% of haplotypes and 70% of GMYC species found only at single sites. Main conclusionsDispersal events, although rare, may be facilitated by environmental events such as prevailing onshore winds or occasional flow of rainwater to the coast. We conclude that the high genetic diversity we observed is the result of ancient springtail lineages, patchy distribution of suitable habitats, and limited dispersal (gene flow) among habitable locations.","2019","9","10.1002/ece3.5103","me","not yet"

However, little is known about how cosmopolitan or rare taxa combine to constitute communities and whether environmental variations promote changes in their relative abundances. Here we identified the Spatial Abundance Distribution (SpAD) of individual prokaryotic taxa (16S rDNA-defined Operational Taxonomic Units, OTUs) across 108 globally-distributed surface ocean stations. We grouped taxa based on their SpAD shape (normal-like- abundant and ubiquitous; logistic- globally rare, present in few sites; and bimodal- abundant only in certain oceanic regions), and investigated how the abundance of these three categories relates to environmental gradients. Most surface assemblages were numerically dominated by a few cosmopolitan normal-like OTUs, yet there was a gradual shift towards assemblages dominated by logistic taxa in specific areas with productivity and temperature differing the most from the average conditions in the sampled stations. When we performed the SpAD categorization including additional habitats (deeper layers and particles of varying sizes), the SpAD of many OTUs changed towards fewer normal-like shapes, and OTUs categorized as globally rare in the surface ocean became abundant. This suggests that understanding the mechanisms behind microbial rarity and dominance requires expanding the context of study beyond local communities and single habitats. We show that marine bacterial communities comprise taxa displaying a continuum of SpADs, and that variations in their abundances can be linked to habitat transitions or barriers that delimit the distribution of community members.","2019","28","10.1111/mec.15026","me","not yet"

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has long been considered one such toxin candidate, and dietary sulfur along with the abundance of sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) were considered the primary determinants of H2S production and clinical course of UC. The metabolic milieu in the lumen of the colon, however, is the result of a multitude of factors beyond dietary sulfur intake and SRB abundance. Here we present an updated formulation of the H2S toxin hypothesis for UC pathogenesis, which strives to incorporate the interdependency of diet composition and the metabolic activity of the entire colon microbial community. Specifically, we suggest that the increasing severity of inflammation along the proximal-to-distal axis in UC is due to the dilution of beneficial factors, concentration of toxic factors, and changing detoxification capacity of the host, all of which are intimately linked to the nutrient flow from the diet.","2019","11","10.3390/nu11040931","me","not yet"

Yet, we still lack information on which farming practices can effectively shape the soil microbial communities. The aim of this study was to identify the farming practices, which are most effective at positively or negatively modifying bacterial and fungal diversity while considering the soil environmental variation at a landscape scale. A long-term research study catchment (12 km(2)) representative of intensive mixed farming (livestock and crop) in Western Europe was investigated using a regular grid for soil sampling (n = 186). Farming systems on this landscape scale were described in terms of crop rotation, use of fertilizer, soil tillage, pesticides treatments, and liming. Molecular microbial biomass was estimated by soil DNA recovery. Bacterial and fungal communities were analyzed by 16S and 18S rRNA gene pyrosequencing. Microbial biomass was significantly stimulated by the presence of pasture during the crop rotation since temporary and permanent pastures, as compared to annual crops, increased the soil microbial biomass by +23% and +93% respectively. While soil properties (mainly pH) explained much of the variation in bacterial diversity, soil tillage seemed to be the most influential among the farming practices. A 2.4% increase in bacterial richness was observed along our gradient of soil tillage intensity. In contrast, farming practices were the predominant drivers of fungal diversity, which was mainly determined by the presence of pastures during the crop rotation. Compared to annual crops, temporary and permanent pastures increased soil fungal richness by +10% and +14.5%, respectively. Altogether, our landscape-scale investigation allows the identification of farming practices that can effectively shape the soil microbial abundance and diversity, with the goal to improve agricultural soil management and soil ecological integrity.","2019","8","10.1002/mbo3.676","me","not yet"

Microbes, primarily bacteria, are successful colonizers of extreme environments worldwide, yet in many instances, the interplay between harsh conditions, dispersal, and microbial biogeography remains unclear. This lack of clarity is particularly true for habitats where extreme temperature is not the overarching stressor, highlighting a need for studies that focus on the role other primary stressors (e.g., toxicants) play in shaping biogeographic patterns. In this study, we leveraged a naturally paired stream system in southern Mexico to explore how elevated hydrogen sulfide (H2S) influences microbial diversity. We sequenced a portion of the 16S rRNA gene using bacterial primers for water sampled from three geographically proximate pairings of streams with high (>20 mu M) or low (similar to 0 mu M) H2S concentrations. After exploring bacterial diversity within and among sites, we compared our results to a previous study of macroinvertebrates and fish for the same sites. By spanning multiple organismal groups, we were able to illuminate how H2S may differentially affect biodiversity. The presence of elevated H2S had no effect on overall bacterial diversity (p = 0.21), a large effect on community composition (25.8% of variation explained, p < 0.0001), and variable influence depending upon the group-whether fish, macroinvertebrates, or bacteriabeing considered. For bacterial diversity, we recovered nine abundant operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that comprised a core H2S-rich stream microbiome in the region. Many H2S-associated OTUs were members of the Epsilonproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria, which both have been implicated in endosymbiotic relationships between sulfur-oxidizing bacteria and eukaryotes, suggesting the potential for symbioses that remain to be discovered in these habitats.","2019","77","10.1007/s00248-018-1237-6","me","not yet"

One or a few genes (referred to as marker genes) in a metabolic pathway of interest in meta-omic data are typically used to represent the prevalence of a biogeochemical reaction. This approach often fails to demonstrate a consistent relationship between gene abundance and an ecosystem process rate. One reason this may occur is if a marker gene is not a good representative of a complete pathway. Here, we map the presence of 11 nitrogen (N)-cycling pathways in over 6000 complete bacterial and archaeal genomes using the Integrated Microbial Genomes database. Incomplete N-cycling pathways occurred in 39% of surveyed archaeal and bacterial species revealing a weakness in current marker-gene analyses. Furthermore, we found that most organisms have limited ability to utilize inorganic N in multiple oxidation states. This suggests that inter-organism exchange of inorganic N compounds is common, highlighting the importance of both community composition and spatial structure in determining the extent of recycling versus loss in an ecosystem.","2019","77","10.1007/s00248-018-1239-4","me","not yet"

Through a network theory approach, we characterised patterns of co-occurrences between bacteria and Symbiodinium with 13 coral genera across six water basins. The majority of the bacteria-Symbiodinium co-occurrences were specific to either a coral genus or water basin, emphasising both coral host and environment as important factors driving the diversity of coral assemblages. Yet, results also identified bacteria and Symbiodinium that were shared by multiple coral genera across several water basins.

It has also found important applications in microbial ecology in recent years thanks to the breakthroughs in metagenomic sequencing technology. Nevertheless, SAR has a serious limitation for practical applications-ignoring the species abundance and treating all species as equally abundant. This study aims to explore the biogeography discoveries of human microbiome over 18 sites of 5 major microbiome habitats, establish the baseline DAR (diversity-area scaling relationship) parameters, and perform comparisons with the classic SAR. The extension from SAR to DAR by adopting the Hill numbers as diversity measures not only overcomes the previously mentioned flaw of SAR but also allows for obtaining a series of important findings on the human microbiome biodiversity and biogeography. Specifically, two types of DAR models were built, the traditional power law (PL) and power law with exponential cutoff (PLEC), using comprehensive datasets from the HMP (human microbiome project). Furthermore, the biogeography maps for 18 human microbiome sites using their DAR profiles for assessing and predicting the diversity scaling across individuals, PDO profiles (pair-wise diversity overlap) for measuring diversity overlap (similarity), and MAD profile (for predicting the maximal accrual diversity in a population) were sketched out. The baseline biogeography maps for the healthy human microbiome diversity can offer guidelines for conserving human microbiome diversity and investigating the health implications of the human microbiome diversity and heterogeneity.","2019","77","10.1007/s00248-018-1245-6","me","not yet"

Here, we investigated the relationship between assemblages of diatoms and of heterotrophic prokaryotes in surface waters of the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean in early spring. The community composition of diatoms and that of total and active prokaryotes were different among the major ocean zones investigated. We found significant relationships between compositional changes of diatoms and of prokaryotes. In contrast, spatial changes in the prokaryotic community composition were not related to geographic distance and to environmental parameters when the effect of diatoms was accounted for. Diatoms explained 30% of the variance in both the total and the active prokaryotic community composition in early spring in the Southern Ocean. Using co-occurrence analyses, we identified a large number of highly significant correlations between abundant diatom species and prokaryotic taxa. Our results show that key diatom species of the Southern Ocean are each associated with a distinct prokaryotic community, suggesting that diatom assemblages contribute to shaping the habitat type for heterotrophic prokaryotes.","2019","21","10.1111/1462-2920.14579","me","not yet"

In this study, we explored the control efficiency of two BCA communities on bacterial wildfire disease by repeatedly spraying BCAs on tobacco leaves. The results of field tests showed that BCAs used in our study, especially BCA_B, had remarkable control effects against tobacco wildfire disease. The higher control efficiency of BCA_B might be attributed to a highly diverse and complex community in the phyllosphere. By 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing, we found that phyllosphere microbial community, including community diversity, taxonomic composition and microbial interactions, changed significantly by application of BCAs. According to the correlation analysis, it showed that wildfire disease infection of plants was negatively related to phyllosphere microbial diversity, indicating a highly diverse community in the phyllosphere might prevent pathogens invasion and colonization. In addition, we inferred that a more complex network in the phyllosphere might be beneficial for decreasing the chances of bacterial wildfire outbreak, and the genera of Pantoea and Sphingomonas might play important roles in wildfire disease suppression.

However, as the intensity of scientific investigation has increased, so these views have started to change. In particular, the role and impact of human activity toward indigenous microbial communities has started to come under more intense scrutiny. During the Subglacial Lake Ellsworth exploration campaign in December 2012, a microbiological survey was conducted to determine the extent and likelihood of exogenous input into the subglacial lake system during the hot-water drilling process. Snow was collected from the surface to represent that used for melt water production for hot-water drilling. The results of this study showed that snow used to provide melt water differed in its microbiological composition from that of the surrounding area and raised the question of how the biogeography of snow-borne microorganisms might influence the potential outcome of scientific analyses. In this study, we investigated the biogeography of microorganisms in snow around a series of Antarctic logistic hubs, where human activity was clearly apparent, and from which scientific investigations have been undertaken. A change in microbial community structure with geographical location was apparent and, notably, a decrease in alpha diversity at more remote southern latitudes. Soil-related microorganisms dominated microbial assemblages suggesting terrestrial input, most likely from long-range aeolian transport into continental Antarctica. We also observed that relic DNA was not a major issue when assessing snow samples.

In the current study, we used next-generation sequencing to characterize the differences in soil bacterial communities in five offshore subtropical granite islands (Matsu Islets, MI) of mainland China and two offshore tropical andesite islands (Orchid [OI] and Green Islands [GI]) of Taiwan. The soils of OI and GI were more acidic and had higher organic carbon and total nitrogen content than MI soils. The bacterial communities were dominated by Acidobacteria and Proteobacteria but had different relative abundance because soils were derived from different parent material and because of geographic distance. Non-metric multi-dimensional scaling revealed that the communities formed different clusters among different parent material and geographically distributed soils. The alpha-diversity in bacterial communities was higher in tropical than subtropical soils. Mantel test and redundancy analysis indicated that bacterial diversity and compositions of OI and GI soils, respectively, were positively correlated with soil pH, organic carbon, total nitrogen, microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen. These results suggest that variations in soil properties of offshore islands could result from differences in soil parent material. Distinct soils derived from different parent material and geographic distance could in turn alter the bacterial communities.","2019","9","10.1038/s41598-019-41170-9","me","not yet"

Little information is available about the impacts of the invasion chronosequence of Spartina alterniflora on the dynamics of soil microbial community. Soil microbial community in coastal salt marshes invaded by S. alterniflora and reference wetlands covered by Suaeda salsa were investigated using phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) profiling along a short-term chronosequence (i.e., 2-, 5- and 10-year) of S. alterniflora invasion in the Yellow River Estuary. Results exhibited an increase in soil moisture, soil organic matter (SOM), soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total nitrogen (TN) and the total of PLFAs with increasing invasion ages of S. alterntflora in these coastal salt marshes. Comparatively, soil pH and bulk density exhibited a weak decline along the invasion chronosequence. The elevated values of relative abundance of fungi and the ratios of fungi: bacteria (F/B) in all invaded salt marshes were mainly associated with the accumulation of soil available substrate (e.g., SOM, DOC and TN). S. alterniflora invasion also increased the ratios of gram-positive/gram-negative (G+/G-) bacterial PLFAs, with the highest value occurring in the 2-year invaded salt marshes. The bacterial stress indicated by ratios of cy17:0/16:1 omega 7c and cy19:0/18:1 omega 7c consistently decreased along the invasion chronosequence. In conclusion, the shifts of soil microbial community composition were tightly associated with soil variables, such as soil pH and soil nutrient supply. Our findings reflect the short-term chronological effects of S. alterniflora invasion on the soil physicochemical characteristics and microbial communities, which contributes to the linkage between the plant invasion and soil development of coastal salt marshes.

Here, we demonstrate that, although in low relative abundance (i.e., fungal reads made up 1.4-2.9% of the metagenomes), fungi contribute to both phylogenetic and functional microbial diversity with a conserved fungal presence in global marine samples. Universally distributed taxa and functions implicate them in complex carbon and fatty acid metabolism, with depth stratification along pelagic zones. Functional differences in observed genes between epipelagic and mesopelagic waters indicate changes in UV protection, shift to carbohydrate limited diets, as well as alternative energy sources.

Despite microbes importance in plants, seeds are mostly sterile, and most plant microbes are recruited from an environmental pool. Surprisingly little is known about the processes that govern how environmental microbes assemble on plants in nature. In this study we examine how bacteria are distributed across plant parts, and how these distributions interact with spatial gradients. We sequenced amplicons of bacteria from the surfaces of six plant parts and adjacent soil of Scaevola taccada, a common beach shrub, along a 60 km transect spanning Oahu islands windward coast, as well as within a single intensively-sampled site. Bacteria are more strongly partitioned by plant part as compared with location. Within S. taccada plants, microbial communities are highly nested: soil and rhizosphere communities contain much of the diversity found elsewhere, whereas reproductive parts fall at the bottom of the nestedness hierarchy. Nestedness patterns suggest either that microbes follow a source/sink gradient from the ground up, or else that assembly processes correlate with other traits, such as tissue persistence, that are vertically stratified.

Sediment samples were collected from three glacial lakes, viz., Plav Lake (in a zone of the highest impact of human population), Black Lake (a zone of medium impact of human population), and Donje Bare Lake (a remote lake with minimal impact of human population). Canonical correlation analysis analysis indicated correlation between the distance of the lake from urbanized population and bacterial diversity in Donje Bare Lake sediment. Bacterial diversity of Black Lake sediment was correlated with high content of phosphorous and pH value. Chemical compounds exhibiting the most prominent correlation with bacterial diversity of Plav Lake were NH4-N, K2O, CaCo3, and total nitrogen . Additionally, CCA analysis indicated that population density was correlated with biodiversity of bacterial communities in Plav Lake sediment, which is the most exposed to human population. Multivariate regression revealed the highest correlation between the presence of Proteobacteria classes and population density and levels of NH4-N. The influence of human population was observed to be important for shaping the sediment communities in addition to biological and chemical factors.","2019","36","10.1080/01490451.2018.1550128","me","not yet"

These communities may also differ from one other as a result of geographical isolation. Here we compare microbial community composition in surficial sediments of two hadal environments-the Mariana and Kermadec trenches-to evaluate microbial biogeography at hadal depths. Sediment microbial consortia were distinct between trenches, with higher relative sequence abundances of taxa previously correlated with organic matter degradation present in the Kermadec Trench. In contrast, the Mariana Trench, and deeper sediments in both trenches, were enriched in taxa predicted to break down recalcitrant material and contained other uncharacterized lineages. At the 97% similarity level, sequence-abundant taxa were not trench-specific and were related to those found in other hadal and abyssal habitats, indicating potential connectivity between geographically isolated sediments. Despite the diversity of microorganisms identified using culture-independent techniques, most isolates obtained under in situ pressures were related to previously identified piezophiles. Members related to these same taxa also became dominant community members when native sediments were incubated under static, long-term, unamended high-pressure conditions. Our results support the hypothesis that there is connectivity between sediment microbial populations inhabiting the Mariana and Kermadec trenches while showing that both whole communities and specific microbial lineages vary between trench of collection and sediment horizon depth. This in situ biodiversity is largely missed when incubating samples within pressure vessels and highlights the need for revised protocols for high-pressure incubations.","2019","10","10.3389/fmicb.2019.00347","me","not yet"

However, studying species interactions belowground has unique challenges relative to the aboveground realm. The structure of the media and spatial scale are among the key aspects that seem to strongly influence belowground interactions. As a consequence, our understanding of species interactions belowground is limited, at least compared to what is known about interactions aboveground. Here we address the general question: Do the ecological concepts that have been developed largely in aboveground systems apply to understanding species interactions in the rhizosphere? We first explore to what extent ecological concepts related to species interactions are considered in rhizosphere studies across various subdisciplines. Next, we explore differences and similarities above-and belowground for fundamental concepts in ecology, choosing topics that are underrepresented in rhizosphere studies but represent a swath of concepts: species diversity, island biogeography, self-organization and ecosystem engineering, trophic cascades, and chemical communication. Finally, we highlight to overcome major challenges of current methodologies to study rhizosphere interactions in order to advance the understanding of belowground interactions in an ecological context. By synthesizing literature related to rhizosphere interactions, we reveal similarities, as well as key differences, in how fundamental ecological concepts are used and tested in above-and belowground studies. Closing the knowledge gaps identified in our synthesis will promote a deeper understanding of the differences above-and belowground and ultimately lead to integration of these concepts.","2019","7","10.3389/fevo.2019.00058","me","not yet"

Plants that form obligate symbiotic associations with microbes dominate island ecosystems, but the relationship between island inhabitance and symbiotic specificity is unclear, especially in the tropics. To fill this gap, we examined the mycorrhizal specificity of the Hawaiian endemic orchid Anoectochilus sandvicensis across multiple populations encompassing its entire geographic distribution. Methods By molecular phylogenetic approaches we identified the mycorrhizal fungi associated with A. sandvicensis across its entire geographic distribution and determined the relationship of these fungi to others found elsewhere around the globe. With richness estimators, we assessed the mycorrhizal specificity of A. sandvicensis within and among islands. We then tested whether geographic proximity of orchid populations was a significant predictor for the presence of particular mycorrhizal fungi and their community composition. Key Results We found that each population of A. sandvicensis forms specific associations with one of three fungi in the genus Ceratobasidium and that the closest relatives of these fungi are globally widespread. Based on diversity indices, A. sandvicensis populations were estimated to partner with one to four mycorrhizal taxa with an estimated total of four compatible mycorrhizal fungi across its entire distribution. However, the geographic proximity of orchid populations was not a significant predictor of mycorrhizal fungal community composition. Conclusions Our findings indicate that the colonization and survival of plant species on even the most remote oceanic islands is not restricted to symbiotic generalists, and that partnering with few, but cosmopolitan microbial symbionts is an alternative means for successful island establishment. We suggest that the spatial distribution and abundance of symbionts in addition to island age, size and isolation should also be taken into consideration for predictions of island biodiversity.","2019","123","10.1093/aob/mcy198","me","not yet"

However, variations in core and non-core bacterial community structure, as well as the relationships between these communities and water chemistry or geographic distance have not been well studied. Here, we sampled in the entire course of the Lean River, China, and explored the bacterial community composition at each site using Illumina high-throughput sequencing. The proportion of sequence reads assigned to the core community was similar to 95% in the upper and middle reaches, gradually decreasing below 90% in the lower reaches. Both the Chao1 richness index and the Shannon diversity index of the bacterial communities were significantly higher in the wet season than in the dry season, and both indices increased slightly from upstream to downstream. The variation in the non-core community was more aggregated from upstream to downstream in the wet season than in the dry season, while the aggregation of the core community was similar between the dry season and the wet season. The proportion of typical freshwater bacterial was significantly higher in the core community than in the non-core community. NO3--N was the subset of water chemistry parameters that best explained bacterial community dissimilarities, while river length was the subset of geographic distance parameters that best explained bacterial community dissimilarities. Water chemistry parameters explained more of the variations in the bacterial communities than did geographic distance, especially in the dry season. However, the correlation betweenwater chemistry and bacteriawas primarily due to collective allochthonous input (mass effects), not because of any nutritious or toxic effects on bacterial growth competition (species sorting). The greater influence of the mass effects, as compared to species sorting, on bacterial community structure was due to the allochthonous input of bacteria from anthropogenic sources.

Here, a national-scale metabarcoding analysis of 436 locations across 7 different temperate ecosystems shows that belowground animal and microbial (bacteria, archaea, fungi, and protists) richness follow divergent trends, whereas beta-diversity does not. Animal richness is governed by intensive land use and unaffected by soil properties, while microbial richness was driven by environmental properties across land uses.

An increase in bacterial richness was observed from forests to vineyards, whereas network complexity respectively decreased from 16,430 links to 2,046. However, the ratio of positive to negative links within the bacterial networks ranged from 2.9 in forests to 5.5 in vineyards. Networks structure was centered on the most connected genera (called hub), which belonged to Bacteroidetes in forest and grassland soils, but to Actinobacteria in vineyard soils.

Moreover, the hub genera within the bacterial community shifted from copiotrophic taxa in forest soils to more oligotrophic taxa in agricultural soils.","2019","9","10.1038/s41598-019-40422-y","me","not yet"
"Walsh, MG; Mor, SM; Hossain, S","The elephant-livestock interface modulates anthrax suitability in India","PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES","Anthrax is a potentially life-threatening bacterial disease that can spread between wild and livestock animals and humans. Transmission typically occurs indirectly via environmental exposure, with devastating consequences for human and animal health, as well as pastoralist economies. India has a high annual occurrence of anthrax in some regions, but a country-wide delineation of risk has not yet been undertaken. The current study modelled the geographical suitability of anthrax across India and its associated environmental features using a biogeographic application of machine learning. Both biotic and abiotic features contributed to risk across multiple scales of influence. The elephant-livestock interface was the dominant feature in delineating anthrax suitability. In addition, water-soil balance, soil chemistry and historical forest loss were also influential. These findings suggest that the elephant-livestock interface plays an important role in the cycling of anthrax in India. Livestock prevention efforts targeting this interface, particularly within anthropogenic ecotones, may yield successes in reducing ongoing transmission between animal hosts and subsequent zoonotic transmission to humans.","2019","286","10.1098/rspb.2019.0179","me","not yet"

Biogeographical studies have revealed microbial community taxonomy in a given ecosystem to change alongside varying environmental characteristics.

Using a metabarcoding approach combined with sediment microprofiling and biochemistry, we examined vertical and radial sediment profiles of burrows belonging to the pantropica I fiddler crab (subfamily Gelasiminae) in three contrasting mangrove environments across a broad latitudinal range (total samples= 432). Each mangrove was environmentally distinct, reflected in taxonomically different bacterial communities, but communities consistently displayed the same spatial stratification (a halo effect) around the burrow which invariably determined the retention of similar inferred functional community traits independent of the local environment.","2019","9","10.1038/s41598-019-40315-0","me","not yet"

Nevertheless, the causal relationship between them has not been completely elucidated, and colonisation of the gut by oral bacteria is not clear due to the limitations of existing research models. The aim of this study was to develop a human oral microbiota-associated (HOMA) mouse model and to investigate the ecological invasion into the gut. By transplanting human saliva into germ-free (GF) mice, a HOMA mouse model was first constructed. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to reveal the biogeography of oral bacteria along the cephalocaudal axis of the digestive tract. In the HOMA mice, 84.78% of the detected genus-level taxa were specific to the donor. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that the donor oral microbiota clustered with those of the HOMA mice and were distinct from those of specific pathogen-free (SPF) mice. In HOMA mice, OTU counts decreased from the stomach and small intestine to the distal gut. The distal gut was dominated by Streptococcus, Veillonella, Haemophilus, Fusobacterium, Trichococcus and Actinomyces. HOMA mice and human microbiota-associated (HMA) mice along with the GF mice were then cohoused. Microbial communities of cohoused mice clustered together and were significantly separated from those of HOMA mice and HMA mice. The Source Tracker analysis and network analysis revealed more significant ecological invasion from oral bacteria in the small intestines, compared to the distal gut, of cohoused mice.

Here, we collected 251 soil samples from adjacent pairs of maize and rice fields at a continental scale in eastern China. We revealed the major ecological roles of the core microbiota in maintaining complex connections between bacterial taxa and their associations with belowground multinutrient cycling. By identifying the habitat preferences of the core microbiota, we built a continental atlas for mapping the spatial distributions of bacteria in agro-soils, which helps forecast the responses of agricultural ecosystems to anthropogenic disturbance. The multinutrient cycling index for maize and rice soils was related to bacterial alpha-diversity and beta-diversity, respectively. Rice soils exhibited higher bacterial diversity and closer bacterial cooccurrence relationships than maize soils. In contrast to the macro- or microecological latitudinal richness patterns in natural terrestrial ecosystems, the bacteria in maize soils showed higher richness at high latitudes; however, this trend was not observed in rice soils. This study provides a new perspective on the distinct bacterial biogeographic patterns to predict the ecological roles of the core microbiota in agro-soils and thus helps manage soil bacterial communities for better provisioning of key ecosystem services. IMPORTANCE Disentangling the roles of the core microbiota in community maintaining and soil nutrient cycling is an important yet poorly understood topic in microbial ecology. This study presents an exploratory effort to gain predictive understanding of the spatial atlas and ecological roles of the core microbiota. A systematic, continental-scale survey was conducted using agro-soils in adjacent pairs of maize (dryland) and rice (wetland) fields across eastern China.

We hypothesized that elevation would be a strong predictor of phylogenetic community assembly, with communities being more phylogenetically clustered towards higher elevations, due to more extreme physiological conditions. We also hypothesized a greater role of stochasticity at the highest elevations, due to more frequent soil disturbance. Contrary to our hypotheses, we found that the strength of phylogenetic clustering and the role of stochasticity were strongly related to soil pH, with phylogenetic clustering and deterministic processes being strongest at lower soil pH values.

"Vlok, M; Lang, AS; Suttle, CA","Marine RNA Virus Quasispecies Are Distributed throughout the Oceans","MSPHERE","RNA viruses, particularly genetically diverse members of the Picornavirales, are widespread and abundant in the ocean. Gene surveys suggest that there are spatial and temporal patterns in the composition of RNA virus assemblages, but data on their diversity and genetic variability in different oceanographic settings are limited. Here, we show that specific RNA virus genomes have widespread geographic distributions and that the dominant genotypes are under purifying selection. Genomes from three previously unknown picorna-like viruses (BC-1, -2, and -3) assembled from a coastal site in British Columbia, Canada, as well as marine RNA viruses JP-A, JP-B, and Heterosigma akashiwo RNA virus exhibited different biogeographical patterns. Thus, biotic factors such as host specificity and viral life cycle, and not just abiotic processes such as dispersal, affect marine RNA virus distribution. Sequence differences relative to reference genomes imply that virus quasispecies are under purifying selection, with synonymous single-nucleotide variations dominating in genomes from geographically distinct regions resulting in conservation of amino acid sequences. Conversely, sequences from coastal South Africa that mapped to marine RNA virus JP-A exhibited more nonsynonymous mutations, probably representing amino acid changes that accumulated over a longer separation. This biogeographical analysis of marine RNA viruses demonstrates that purifying selection is occurring across oceanographic provinces. These data add to the spectrum of known marine RNA virus genomes, show the importance of dispersal and purifying selection for these viruses, and indicate that closely related RNA viruses are pathogens of eukaryotic microbes across oceans. IMPORTANCE Very little is known about aquatic RNA virus populations and genome evolution. This is the first study that analyzes marine environmental RNA viral assemblages in an evolutionary and broad geographical context. This study contributes the largest marine RNA virus metagenomic data set to date, substantially increasing the sequencing space for RNA viruses and also providing a baseline for comparisons of marine RNA virus diversity.

Such activities pose significant long-term disturbances and potentially severe impacts to both ecosystem structure and functioning, as well as associated ecosystem services. The Rio Grande Rise presents a severely understudied area, with very little knowledge on either local and regional scales. Most detailed knowledge available is centered on highly localised geological information and interpolated and/or modelled environmental data, while high-resolution data on biogeography, ecosystem processes and functioning are lacking. The Rio Grande Rise is most likely a remnant of the Parana-Etendeka igneous province, and formed when the African and South-American plates separated to form the Southern Atlantic basin, about 75 million years ago. More recent cruises have generated very local and high-resolution acoustic impedance data on the substrate, showing extremely dense layers, likely to be cobalt-rich crusts and underlying bedrock, interspersed with thick sediment layers. Literature studies revealed that nowadays the Rise appears to be located within a relatively low-productivity oceanic region. Open-database mining yielded large-scale, extrapolated environmental data rasters, which show the Rise to be an oceanic region relatively free of pollution and anthropogenic disturbances, with high geomorphological heterogeneity and potential for high biodiversity. This image was confirmed in a small number of scientific submarine cruises, where a diverse range of seascapes was observed, from soft sediment to carbonate pavement and cobalt crust outcrops. Especially the latter substrata were found to be inhabited by diverse benthic communities, dominated by sessile organisms, presenting three-dimensional structural heterogeneity and with associated vertebrate and invertebrate animals. Cobalt-rich crusts appear to grow at an extremely slow rate of several mm per million years, in the deep ocean where biological and ecological processes such as reproduction, growth and recolonisation are characterised by slow dynamics. The main disturbances posed by deep-sea mining of cobalt-rich crusts on the Rio Grande Rise consist of (1) complete removal of substrate with its particular benthic communities, (2) strong localised increases in suspended particulate matter, causing smothering of breathing apparatus and dilution of food particles, (3) crushing by tailings and overburden and (4) toxicity effects by released metals and other toxic substances, likely to be increased under high pressure. These impacts will likely change the deep-sea ecosystem at the Rio Grande Rise and its functioning for time scales in the order of decades to centuries. State-of-the-art geological, environmental and ecological modelling, complemented with high-quality, fine-resolution data are needed to provide a detailed evaluation of the impacts of cobalt-rich ferromanganese crust mining in the Rio Grande Rise, with the goal to formulate strategic environmental management plans.","2019","145","10.1016/j.dsr.2018.12.007","me","not yet"
"Nasko, DJ; Ferrell, BD; Moore, RM; Bhavsar, JD; Polson, SW; Wommack, KE","CRISPR Spacers Indicate Preferential Matching of Specific Virioplankton Genes","MBIO","Viral infection exerts selection pressure on marine microbes, as virus-induced cell lysis causes 20 to 50% of cell mortality, resulting in fluxes of bio-mass into oceanic dissolved organic matter. Archaeal and bacterial populations can defend against viral infection using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-associated (Cas) system, which relies on specific matching between a spacer sequence and a viral gene. If a CRISPR spacer match to any gene within a viral genome is equally effective in preventing lysis, no viral genes should be preferentially matched by CRISPR spacers. However, if there are differences in effectiveness, certain viral genes may demonstrate a greater frequency of CRISPR spacer matches. Indeed, homology search analyses of bacterioplankton CRISPR spacer sequences against virioplankton sequences revealed preferential matching of replication proteins, nucleic acid binding proteins, and viral structural proteins. Positive selection pressure for effective viral defense is one parsimonious explanation for these observations. CRISPR spacers from virioplankton metagenomes preferentially matched methyltransferase and phage integrase genes within virioplankton sequences. These virioplankton CRISPR spacers may assist infected host cells in defending against competing phage. Analyses also revealed that half of the spacer-matched viral genes were unknown, some genes matched several spacers, and some spacers matched multiple genes, a many-tomany relationship. Thus, CRISPR spacer matching may be an evolutionary algorithm, agnostically identifying those genes under stringent selection pressure for sustaining viral infection and lysis. Investigating this subset of viral genes could reveal those genetic mechanisms essential to virus-host interactions and provide new technologies for optimizing CRISPR defense in beneficial microbes. IMPORTANCE The CRISPR-Cas system is one means by which bacterial and archaeal populations defend against viral infection which causes 20 to 50% of cell mortality in the ocean. We tested the hypothesis that certain viral genes are preferentially targeted for the initial attack of the CRISPR-Cas system on a viral genome. Using CASC, a pipeline for CRISPR spacer discovery, and metagenome data from oceanic microbes and viruses, we found a clear subset of viral genes with high match frequencies to CRISPR spacers. Moreover, we observed a many-to-many relationship of spacers and viral genes. These high-match viral genes were involved in nucleotide metabolism, DNA methylation, and viral structure. It is possible that CRISPR spacer matching is an evolutionary algorithm pointing to those viral genes most important to sustaining infection and lysis. Studying these genes may advance the understanding of virus-host interactions in nature and provide new technologies for leveraging CRISPR-Cas systems in beneficial microbes.","2019","10","10.1128/mBio.02651-18","me","not yet"
"Zeglin, LH; Crenshaw, CL; Dahm, CN; Sheibley, RW; Takacs-Vesbach, CD","Watershed hydrology and salinity, but not nutrient chemistry, are associated with arid-land stream microbial diversity","FRESHWATER SCIENCE","Microbiota in streams drive many ecosystem functions, including whole-stream metabolism, nitrogen (N) cycling, and the production of basal resources that fuel stream food webs. Interactions between surface water and shallow, subsurface groundwater produce the oxygen and nutrient gradients that influence these microbially mediated biogeochemical functions. Microbial nutrient processing is often limited by nutrient availability, but we lack a clear understanding of the relationships between hydrology, water chemistry, microbial composition, and nutrient cycling. In this study we evaluated the prediction that the microbial (bacterial and archaeal) assemblage composition in surface and subsurface water (both within and among stream reaches) would be related to dissolved nutrient concentrations, surface-subsurface hydrologic connectivity, and reach-scale N cycling rates. To evaluate our predictions, we collected data on water chemistry, whole-stream hydrological connectivity, biogeochemical function, and surface and subsurface water microbial assemblage composition at 6 streams in the southwestern USA. We found no correlation between microbial assemblage composition and stream nutrient concentrations or cycling rates, but observed that subsurface waters in some streams had higher taxonomic richness than surface waters. Instead, differences in microbial assemblage composition among the study streams were correlated with both watershed size and stream water Br- concentrations. These results suggest that the longer, deeper groundwater flowpaths in larger watersheds, which promote solute accumulation, influence streamwater microbial assemblage composition. These contrasting streamwater microbial assemblages were associated with different reach-scale sinks for N immobilization (fine benthic organic matter versus filamentous algae). Overall, results suggest that the catchment-scale history of water movement, and salinity, may affect both microbial diversity and the fate of N. The mechanisms by which stream microbial diversity influences ecosystem function require more attention. In particular, we need a better understanding of how microbial biogeography is influenced by the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of stream ecosystems.","2019","38","10.1086/701597","me","not yet"

Results: With a thickness of more than 30 m, massive microbial boundstone is surrounded by thick-bedded oncoid-intraclast rudstone/grainstone. The reefs were constructed of cylindrical stromatolites and maze-like thrombolites, accompanying a small proportion of lithistid sponges (anthaspidellids) and hypercalcified sponges (Calathium). The earliest Floian age is based on a conodont fauna including the zonal index species Serratognathus bilobatus. Conclusions: The microbialites might have grown in shallow subtidal environments, indicated by the high aspect ratio of the stromatolites and the associated coarse-grained sediments. The initial growth of stromatolites was sufficient to inhibit hydrodynamic removal of sediment and to create microhabitats in which environmental conditions were favourable for later accretion of thrombolites and colonization by anthaspidellids and calathids. These sponge-bearing microbialites represent the initial rise of metazoans in reefs at the dawn of the Ordovician Radiation, providing crucial information for understanding the transition from microbial- to metazoan-dominant reefs during this unique interval.

In particular, very little is known about the speciation mechanisms which may give rise to the diversity of microscopic eukaryotes. It was postulated that the enormous population sizes and ubiquitous distribution of these organisms could lead to a lack of population differentiation and therefore very low speciation rates. However, such assumptions have traditionally been based on morphospecies, which may not accurately reflect the true diversity, missing cryptic taxa. In this study, we aim to articulate the major diversification mechanisms leading to the contemporary molecular diversity by using a colonial freshwater flagellate, Synura sphagnicola, as an example. Phylogenetic analysis of five sequenced loci showed that S. sphagnicola differentiated into two morphologically distinct lineages approximately 15.4 million years ago, which further diverged into several evolutionarily recent haplotypes during the late Pleistocene. The most recent haplotypes are ecologically and biogeographically much more differentiated than the old lineages, presumably because of their persistent differentiation after the allopatric speciation events. Our study shows that in microbial eukaryotes, species diversification via the colonization of new geographical regions or ecological resources occurs much more readily than was previously thought. Consequently, divergence times of microorganisms in some lineages may be equivalent to the estimated times of speciation in plants and animals.","2019","28","10.1111/mec.15011","me","not yet"

In this study, we used an extended ancestral-state reconstruction algorithm to predict the functional capabilities of the rat gastrointestinal microbiome. Our results indicate an apparent tendency toward metabolic heterogeneity along the longitudinal and transverse axes of the rat gastrointestinal tract (GIT). This heterogeneity was suggested by the enriched small-molecule transport activity and amino acid metabolism in the upper GIT, the aerobic energy metabolism in the stomach and the mucolysis-related metabolism in the lower GIT mucus layer. In contrast to prior results, many functional overlaps were observed when the gastrointestinal microbiomes of different hosts were compared. These overlaps implied that although both the biogeographic location and host genotype were prominent driving forces in shaping the gastrointestinal microbiota, the microbiome functions were similar across hosts when observed under similar physicochemical conditions at identical anatomical sites. Our work effectively complements the rat microbial biogeography dataset we released in 2017 and, thus, contributes to a better understanding and prediction of disease-related alterations in microbial community function.","2019","20","10.3390/ijms20051232","me","not yet"

We simultaneously examined the community compositions and structures of soil bacteria, fungi, and diazotrophs across desert, typical, and meadow steppes in Inner Mongolia using high-throughput sequencing. The results showed that soil bacteria, fungi, and diazotrophs exhibited different distribution patterns across steppe types. Although different steppes displayed obvious differences in climate conditions, plant traits, and soil properties, most of bacterial species were shared by all the steppes while only a few species were unique, indicating that the soil bacterial compositions were hardly influenced by the steppe types. Nevertheless, the habitat heterogeneity could cause shifts in the relative abundance of some bacterial groups, which resulted in significant changes in the community structure of soil bacteria across steppes. However, the fungal community compositions and structures were similar in typical and meadow steppes but that in desert steppe were significantly different. Whereas, the community compositions and structures of diazotrophs were strongly related to the steppe types. In this study, the similar parent material backgrounds of the steppe soils might be the important factor in shaping the homologous bacterial compositions. However, the variations in soil fertility, soil water repellency, and plant species across steppes would be the major driving forces in regulating the compositions and structures of fungal communities, while the diazotrophic communities would be more closely related to the changes in plant traits and soil fertility among steppes. Our results provided evidence of habitat specificity for different microbial groups and their underlying drivers.","2019","9","10.1002/ece3.4940","me","not yet"

At each mangrove, sediments were collected from both Avicennia marina-planted zones and intertidal mudflats. The community abundance, richness, diversity and structure of sediment bacteria differed greatly among mangrove wetlands.

This knowledge gap strongly limits our ability to predict the effect of environmental filtering on microbial community structure and function. To improve the understanding of mechanisms underlying community assembly processes, we investigated bacterial community structure and function on a subalpine shady slope and a sunny slope in the Pangquangou National Nature Reserve in North China. By integrating the results of a null model and the RC metric, we inferred that a deterministic process, that is, environmental filtering, drove bacterial community biogeographical patterns. Edaphic factors caused the largest contribution to microbial community structure, followed by vegetation and spatial variables. Among edaphic factors, total carbon (TC) and total nitrogen (TN) were the most important factors as determined by redundancy analysis (RDA). Moreover, network analysis suggested that the status of bacterial community co-occurrence was significantly greater than that of exclusive relationships. Under environmental stress, there was no significant difference in the overall bacterial community structure on the different slopes, while significant differences were observed in relation to community functions. Given this, we inferred that the degrees of response of bacterial community structure and function to varying environments were not consistent. In conclusion, our results contribute to the understanding of deterministic versus stochastic balance in bacterial community assembly and the response mechanisms of community structure and function to environmental heterogeneity.","2019","59","10.1002/jobm.201800314","me","not yet"

Identifying these mechanisms is significant for understanding how microbes have evolved to fill specific ecological niches within a host. Vibrio fischeri is a bioluminescent bacterium that colonizes and proliferates within the light organ of the Hawaiian bobtail squid, which provides an opportunity to study how bacteria grow in vivo. Here, the transcription factor CysB is shown to be necessary for V. fischeri both to grow on several sulfur sources in vitro and to establish symbiosis with juvenile squid. CysB is also found to regulate several genes involved in sulfate assimilation and to contribute to the growth of V. fischeri on cystine, which is the oxidized form of cysteine. A mutant that grows on cystine but not sulfate could establish symbiosis, suggesting that V. fischeri acquires nutrients related to this compound within the host. Finally, CysB-regulated genes are shown to be differentially expressed among the V. fischeri populations occupying the various colonization sites found within the light organ. Together, these results suggest the biogeography of V. fischeri populations within the squid light organ impacts the physiology of this symbiotic bacterium in vivo through CysB-dependent gene regulation.","2019","111","10.1111/mmi.14177","me","not yet"

Here we report on a comprehensive analysis of the drivers of diversity distribution and composition of the ecologically and economically important Phytophthora genus from 414 soil samples collected across Australia. We assessed 22 environmental and seven categorical variables as potential predictors of Phytophthora species richness, alpha and beta diversity, including both phylogenetically and non-phylogenically explicit methods. In addition, we classified each species as putatively native or introduced and examined the distribution with respect to putative origin. The two most widespread species, P. multivora and P. cinnamomi, are introduced, though five of the ten most widely distributed species are putatively native. Introduced taxa comprised over 54% of Australias Phytophthora diversity and these species are known pathogens of annual and perennial crop habitats as well as urban landscapes and forestry. Patterns of composition were most strongly predicted by bioregion (R-2 = 0.29) and ecoregion (R-2 = 0.26) identity; mean precipitation of warmest quarter, mean temperature of the wettest quarter and latitude were also highly significant and described approximately 21, 14 and 13% of variation in NMDS composition, respectively. We also found statistically significant evidence for phylogenetic over-dispersion with respect to key climate variables.This study provides a strong baseline for understanding biogeographical patterns in this important genus as well the impact of key plant pathogens and invasive Phytophthora species in natural ecosystems.","2019","42","10.1111/ecog.03904","me","not yet"

Large-scale studies are lacking for soil animals, which control microbial communities and represent one of the most diverse yet poorly known animal assemblages. Here, we analyzed a major group (Oribatida) to test whether belowground macroecological patterns can be predicted by climatic variables, vegetation and large-scale variation in key soil properties. Location We modelled the multivariate distribution of more than 100 species using biodiversity data collected across Great Britain in the framework of the Countryside Survey (). Methods We analyzed species-level data from 582 samples collected across 162 hectads (10 x 10 km) covering the largest possible range of vegetation types, soil properties and climatic conditions within GB. We created the first large-scale maps of soil animal diversity metrics at the GB scale, including novel estimates of metrics of phylogenetic diversity (PD). Using structural equation modelling, we quantified the direct and indirect effects of location (latitude, longitude), plant community structure and abiotic factors such as precipitation on species composition, richness and PD. Results We found that variation in species composition follows a latitudinal gradient with diversity generally increasing northward. The latitudinal variation in species composition drives PD via changes in both species richness and phylogenetic distance between species. This gradient is mostly determined by latitudinal variation in precipitation and organic matter, which were very good predictors of species composition. Precipitation and organic matter were, however, relatively weak while statistically significant predictors of diversity metrics. Conclusions Past studies have emphasized the unpredictability of species distributions and variation in species composition in hyper diverse soil animal communities. However, past studies were conducted at small scales, where stochastic factors may weaken the signal of deterministic factors. Oribatid mites in our study show for the first time that the large scale latitudinal gradients in climate and organic matter predict not only variation in species composition but also taxonomic and PD of soil animal communities.","2019","46","10.1111/jbi.13501","me","not yet"

Poseidoniales ord. nov.)","ISME JOURNAL","Marine Group II (MGII) archaea represent the most abundant planktonic archaeal group in ocean surface waters, but our understanding of the group has been limited by a lack of cultured representatives and few sequenced genomes. Here, we conducted a comparative phylogenomic analysis of 270 recently available MGII metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) to investigate their evolution and ecology. Based on a rank-normalised genome phylogeny, we propose that MGII is an order-level lineage for which we propose the name Candidatus Poseidoniales (after Gr. n. Poseidon, God of the sea), comprising the families Candidatus Poseidonaceae fam. nov. (formerly subgroup MGIIa) and Candidatus Thalassarch-aeaceae fam. nov. (formerly subgroup MGIIb). Within these families, 21 genera could be resolved, many of which had distinct biogeographic ranges and inferred nutrient preferences. Phylogenetic analyses of key metabolic functions suggest that the ancestor of Ca. Poseidoniales was a surface water-dwelling photoheterotroph that evolved to occupy multiple related ecological niches based primarily on spectral tuning of proteorhodopsin genes. Interestingly, this adaptation appears to involve an overwrite mechanism whereby an existing single copy of the proteorhodopsin gene is replaced by a horizontally transferred copy, which in many instances should allow an abrupt change in light absorption capacity. Phototrophy was lost entirely from five Ca. Poseidoniales genera coinciding with their adaptation to deeper aphotic waters. We also report the first instances of nitrate reductase in two genera acquired via horizontal gene transfer (HGT), which was a potential adaptation to oxygen limitation. Additional metabolic traits differentiating families and genera include flagellar-based adhesion, transporters, and sugar, amino acid, and peptide degradation. Our results suggest that HGT has shaped the evolution of Ca. Poseidoniales to occupy a variety of ecological niches and to become the most successful archaeal lineage in ocean surface waters.","2019","13","10.1038/s41396-018-0282-y","me","not yet"

Here we use a trait-based approach to identify direct effects of salinity on soil bacterial communities across two salinity gradients. Through dose-response relationships between salinity and bacterial growth, we quantified distributions of the trait salt tolerance within the communities. Community salt tolerance was closely correlated with soil salinity, indicating a strong filtering effect of salinity on the bacterial communities. Accompanying the increases in salt tolerance were consistent shifts in bacterial community composition. We identified specific bacterial taxa that increased in relative abundances with community salt tolerance, which could be used as bioindicators for high community salt tolerance. A strong filtering effect was also observed for pH across the gradients, with pH tolerance of bacterial communities correlated to soil pH.

We present here one of the most comprehensive reports on Glomeromycotinan community structure in forest ecosystems, covering five ecosystem types. We explored the extent to which the latitudinal gradient in Glomeromycotinan diversity is confounded by the respective latitudinal gradient of host plants and how Glomeromycotinan communities diverge with spatial distance and environmental variability. We show that latitudinal differences in Glomeromycotinan alpha- and beta-diversity are largely shaped by the zonation patterns of ecosystem types and that differences among Glomeromycotinan communities occurring in different ecosystems are considerably larger than those occurring within the same ecosystem type. In contrast, we could observe little to no differences in phylogenetic community structure across samples, irrespective of their origin. In conclusion, several community assembly rules for Glomeromycotina in the woody systems, such as phylogenetic relationships, differed from those in grassland systems. Synthesis. We provide strong evidence that the latitudinal gradient in Glomeromycotinan diversity in woody systems is mainly driven by latitudinal differences in forest habitat types.

For microbes that are plant symbionts, community assembly processes can lead to either a positive or negative relationship between plant size or age and soil microbe diversity. Here, we evaluated the extent to which such relationships exist within a single legume species (Acacia acuminata) and their naturally occurring symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria (rhizobia). We quantified the diversity of rhizobia that associate with A. acuminata trees of variable size spanning a large environmental gradient in southwest Australia (72 trees in 24 sites spread across similar to 300,000 km(2)), using metabarcoding. We modelled rhizobia diversity using 16S exact genetic variants, in a binomial multivariate statistical framework that controlled for climate and local soil characteristics. We identified two major phylogenetic clades of rhizobia that associate with A. acuminata. Soil sampled at the base of larger Acacia trees contained a higher richness of rhizobia genetic variants. Each major clade responds differently to environmental factors (climate and soil characteristics), but the positive association between tree size and rhizobia genetic diversity was mainly driven by responses from one of the two clades. Overall tree size explained more variation than any other factor, resulting in a similar to 3-fold increase in total richness and clade diversity from the smallest to the largest trees. Synthesis. Previous studies have shown that plant host species is important in structuring microbial soil communities in the rhizosphere. Our results show that host size or age within a single plant species can also structure diversity of at least one group of soil microbes. A positive relationship between plant host size and rhizobia diversity suggests that hosts may modify the niche space of their surrounding soil (niche construction hypothesis) enabling a higher richness of microbial taxa. That different rhizobial groups responded differently to host size and other ecological factors suggests that rhizobia is not an ecologically uniform group, and that entirely neutral explanations for our results are unlikely. Host plants may be analogous to islands, where larger plant hosts may accumulate diversity over time, through migration opportunities.","2019","107","10.1111/1365-2745.13083","me","not yet"

Overall, Bacterial community structure and turnover showed distinct patterns in different groups. Bacterial phyla were mainly composed of Proteobacteria followed by Chloroflexi, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes in all groups of wetland samples. At genus level, random forest model showed that Coprothermobacter and Acetobacter were two most important genera explaining the differences among groups. The abundances of these genera were very low in IW relative to the other two groups. The alpha diversity of IW was significantly higher than those of TW and CW. The relative contribution of environmental factors was larger in the assemblages of bacterial communities in TW and CW than that in IW. The pH and conductivity were recognized as the most important measured environmental factors influencing bacterial community structure. Our results suggested that the bacterial communities of wetlands in different regions were shaped with different mechanisms.

However, the importance of historical factors in microbial biogeography is more debatable. Historical factors include past ecological and evolutionary circumstances that may have influenced present-day microbial diversity, such as dispersal and past environmental conditions. Diverse thermophilic sulfate-reducing Desulfotomaculum are present as dormant endospores in marine sediments worldwide where temperatures are too low to support their growth. Therefore, they are dispersed to here from elsewhere, presumably a hot, anoxic habitat. While dispersal through ocean currents must influence their distribution in cold marine sediments, it is not clear whether even earlier historical factors, related to the source habitat where these organisms were once active, also have an effect. We investigated whether these historical factors may have influenced the diversity and distribution of thermophilic endospores by comparing their diversity in 10 Arctic fjord surface sediments. Although community composition varied spatially, clear biogeographic patterns were only evident at a high level of taxonomic resolution (> 97% sequence similarity of the 16S rRNA gene) achieved with oligotyping. In particular, the diversity and distribution of oligotypes differed for the two most prominent OTUs (defined using a standard 97% similarity cutoff). One OTU was dominated by a single ubiquitous oligotype, while the other OTU consisted of ten more spatially localized oligotypes that decreased in compositional similarity with geographic distance. These patterns are consistent with differences in historical factors that occurred when and where the taxa were once active, prior to sporulation. Further, the influence of history on biogeographic patterns was only revealed by analyzing microdiversity within OTUs, suggesting that populations within standard OTU-level groupings do not necessarily share a common ecological and evolutionary history.","2019","10","10.3389/fmicb.2019.00245","me","not yet"

On the Pacific coast of North America, two canopy-forming kelps with contrasting life histories co-occur; Macrocystis pyrifera, a perennial species, and Nereocystis luetkeana, an annual species. Kelp blade-associated microbes were sampled from 12 locations across a spatial gradient in Washington, United States, from the outer Pacific Coast to Puget Sound. Microbial communities were characterized using next-generation Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA genes. At higher taxonomic levels (bacterial phylum and class), canopy-forming kelps hosted remarkably similar microbial communities, but at the amplicon sequence variant level, microbial communities on M. pyrifera and N. luetkeana were host-specific and distinct from free-living bacteria in the surrounding seawater. Microbial communities associated with blades of each kelp species displayed significant geographic variation. The microbiome of N. luetkeana changed along the spatial gradient and was significantly correlated to salinity, with outer Pacific coast sites enriched in Bacteroidetes (family Saprospiraceae) and Gammaproteobacteria (Granulosicoccus sp.), and southern Puget Sound sites enriched in Alphaproteobacteria (family Hyphomonadaceae). We also examined microbial community development and succession on meristematic and apical N. luetkeana blade tissues throughout the summer growing season on Tatoosh Island, WA. Across all dates, microbial communities were less diverse on younger, meristematic blade tissue compared to the older, apical tissues. In addition, phylogenetic relatedness among microbial taxa increased from meristematic to apical blade tissues, suggesting that the addition of microbial taxa to the community was a non-random process that selected for certain phylogenetic groups of microbes. Microbial communities on older, apical tissues displayed significant temporal variation throughout the summer and microbial taxa that were differentially abundant over time displayed clear patterns of community succession. Overall, we report that host species identity, geographic location, and blade tissue age shape the microbial communities on canopy-forming kelps.","2019","10","10.3389/fmicb.2019.00346","me","not yet"

While warming ceased at the turn of the millennium, significant increases in air temperature are expected later this century, with predicted positive effects on soil fungal diversity, plant growth and ecosystem productivity. Here, by sequencing 16S ribosomal RNA genes in 40 soils sampled from along a 1,650 km climatic gradient through the maritime Antarctic, we determine whether rising air temperatures might similarly influence the diversity of soil bacteria. Of 22 environmental factors, mean annual surface air temperature was the strongest and most consistent predictor of soil bacterial diversity. Significant, but weaker, associations between bacterial diversity and soil moisture content, C:N ratio, and Ca, Mg, PO43- and dissolved organic C concentrations were also detected. These findings indicate that further rises in air temperature in the maritime Antarctic may enhance terrestrial ecosystem productivity through positive effects on soil bacterial diversity.","2019","9","10.1038/s41598-019-39521-7","me","not yet"

In this review, we have shown that many African food legumes are nodulated by bradyrhizobia, with greater diversity in Southern Africa compared to other parts of Africa. From a few studies done in Africa, the known bradyrhizobia (i.e., Bradyrhizobium elkanii, B. yuanmingense) along with many novel Bradyrhizobium species are the most dominant in African soils.

"Li, LW; Ma, ZS","Global Microbiome Diversity Scaling in Hot Springs With DAR (Diversity-Area Relationship) Profiles","FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY","The spatial distribution of biodiversity (i.e., the biogeography) of the hot-spring microbiome is critical for understanding the microbial ecosystems in hot springs. We investigated the microbiome diversity scaling (changes) over space by analyzing the diversity-area relationship (DAR), which is an extension to classic SAR (species-area relationship) law in biogeography. We built DAR models for archaea and bacteria with 16S-rRNA sequencing datasets from 165 hot springs globally. From the DAR models, we sketch out the biogeographic maps of hot-spring microbiomes by constructing: (i) DAR profile- measuring the archaea or bacteria diversity scaling over space (areas); (ii) PDO (pair-wise diversity overlap or similarity) profile-estimating the PDO between two hot springs; (iii) MAD (maximal accrual diversity) profile-predicting the global MAD; (iv) LRD/LGD (ratio of local diversity to regional or global diversity) profile. We further investigated the differences between archaea and bacteria in their biogeographic maps. For example, the comparison of DAR-profile maps revealed that the archaea diversity is more heterogeneous (i.e., more diverse) or scaling faster than the bacterial diversity does in terms of species numbers (species richness), but is less heterogeneous (i.e., less diverse) or scaling slower than bacteria when the diversity (Hill numbers) were weighted in favor of more abundant dominant species. When the diversity is weighted equally in terms of species abundances, archaea, and bacteria are equally heterogeneous over space or scaling at the same rate. Finally, unified DAR models (maps) were built with the combined datasets of archaea and bacteria.","2019","10","10.3389/fmicb.2019.00118","me","not yet"

In this study, the integrated effect of seasonal differences and spatial distribution on bacterial community structure and diversity were investigated at the regional scale. We conducted a comprehensive bacterial survey, with 451 samples of the Scotian Shelf sector of the Northwest Atlantic Ocean during spring and fall of 2014 and 2016, to analyze the effects of physicochemical gradients on bacterial community structure. Throughout the region, Pelagibacteraceae and Rhodobacteraceae were the most common in the free-living fraction, while Flavobacteriia and Deltaproteobacteria were more abundant in the particle-associated fraction. Overall, there was strong covariation of the microbial community diversity from the two size fractions. This relationship existed despite the statistically significant difference in community structure between the free-living and particle-associated size fractions. In both size fractions, distribution patterns of bacterial taxa, and species within taxa, displayed temporal and spatial preferences. Distinct bacterial assemblages specific to season and depth in the water column were identified. These distinct assemblages, consistent for both 2014 and 2016, suggested replicable patterns in microbial communities for spring and fall in this region. Over all sites, temperature and oxygen values were highly correlated with community similarity, and salinity and oxygen values were the most strongly positively- and negatively correlated with alpha diversity, respectively. However, the strengths of these correlations depended on the depth and season sampled. The bathymetry of the Scotian Shelf, the abrupt shelf break to the Scotian Slope and the major ocean currents dominating in the region led to the formation of distinct on-shelf and off-shelf bacterial communities both in spring and fall. The highest species richness was observed at the shelf break, where water masses from the two major currents meet. Our study establishes the baseline for assessing future changes in the bacterial community of the Scotian Shelf waters, a rapidly changing sector of the Atlantic Ocean.","2019","10","10.3389/fmicb.2019.00281","me","not yet"

The lack of coordinated efforts to gather data at representative temporal and spatial scales limits aerobiology to help understand large scale patterns of global microbial biodiversity and its causal relationships with the environmental context. This paper presents the sampling strategy and analytical protocols developed in order to integrate different fields of research such as microbiology, -omics biology, atmospheric chemistry, physics and meteorology to characterize atmospheric microbial life. These include control of chemical and microbial contaminations from sampling to analysis and identification of experimental procedures for characterizing airborne microbial biodiversity and its functioning from the atmospheric samples collected at remote sites from low cell density environments. We used high-volume sampling strategy to address both chemical and microbial composition of the atmosphere, because it can help overcome low aerosol and microbial cell concentrations. To account for contaminations, exposed and unexposed control filters were processed along with the samples. We present a method that allows for the extraction of chemical and biological data from the same quartz filters. We tested different sampling times, extraction kits and methods to optimize DNA yield from filters. Based on our results, we recommend supplementary sterilization steps to reduce filter contamination induced by handling and transport. These include manipulation under laminar flow hoods and UV sterilization. In terms of DNA extraction, we recommend a vortex step and a heating step to reduce binding to the quartz fibers of the filters. These steps have led to a 10-fold increase in DNA yield, allowing for downstream omics analysis of air samples. Based on our results, our method can be integrated into pre-existing long-term monitoring field protocols for the atmosphere both in terms of atmospheric chemistry and biology. We recommend using standardized air volumes and to develop standard operating protocols for field users to better control the operational quality.","2019","10","10.3389/fmicb.2019.00243","me","not yet"

Ecology offers theoretical frameworks and lexicons to study microbiomes. Yet some of the terms and concepts borrowed from ecology are being used discordantly by microbiome studies from their traditional definitions. Here we define some of the ecological terms and concepts as they are used in ecology and the study of microbiomes. Where applicable, we have provided the historical context of the terms, highlighted examples from microbiome studies, and considered the research methods involved. We divided these concepts into four sections: Biomes, Diversity, Symbiosis, and Succession. Biomes encompass the interactions within the biotic and abiotic features of an environment. This extends to the term microbiome, derived from biome, and includes an environment and all the microbes within it. Diversity encompasses patterns of species richness, abundance, and biogeography, all of which are important to understanding the distribution of microbiomes. Symbiosis emphasizes the relationships between organisms within a community. Symbioses are often misunderstood to be synonymous with mutualism. We discard that implication, in favor of a broader, more historically accurate definition which spans the continuum from parasitism to mutualism. Succession includes classical succession, alternative stable states, community assembly frameworks, and r/K-selection. Our hope is that as microbiome researchers continue to apply ecological terms, and as ecologists continue to gain interest in microbiomes, each will do so in a way that enables cross-talk between them. We recommend initiating these collaborations by using a common lexicon, from which new concepts can emerge.","2019","10","10.3389/fmicb.2019.00292","me","not yet"

To obtain mechanistic understanding of this variation, we investigated the dynamics of methanogenesis over the course of glucose degradation in fourteen paddy field soils and five wetland soils collected from different regions of China. The results revealed that the maximal rate (2-3 mM per day) and the total amount (25-30 mM) of CH4 produced were similar across soil samples. The lag phase of methanogenesis, however, differed substantially with the shortest lag phase of 4 days in a paddy soil from north China and the longest of 32 days in a soil from south China, and this difference reflected a general geographical trend among all soils tested. Nitrate was reduced completely within 4 days in all soils. The reduction of Fe(III) and sulfate was completed after 21 days and 29 days, respectively. The depletion time of Fe(III) and sulfate were positively correlated with the lag phase of methanogenesis. Competition for common substrates between methanogens and iron and sulfate reducers, however, does not explain this coincidence because a slow production of CH4 was detected at the very beginning. It appears that the geographical variations in methanogenesis and the reduction of ferric iron and sulfate are related to the variation in soil pH but not to temperature, soil organic C and nutrient conditions in paddy and wetland soils across eastern China.

Most analyses of coastal microbial communities focus on the characterization of bacteria present in either sediment or seawater, with fewer studies characterizing both sediment and seawater together at a given site, and even fewer studies including information about non-bacterial microbial communities. As a result, knowledge about the ecological patterns of microbial biodiversity across domains and habitats in coastal communities is limited-despite the fact that archaea, bacteria, and microbial eukaryotes are present and known to interact in coastal habitats. To better understand microbial biodiversity patterns in coastal ecosystems, we characterized sediment and seawater microbial communities for three sites along the coastline of Puerto Nuevo, Baja California, Mexico using both 16S and 18S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. We found that sediment hosted approximately 500-fold more operational taxonomic units (OTUs) for bacteria, archaea, and microbial eukaryotes than seawater (p < 0.001). Distinct phyla were found in sediment versus seawater samples. Of the top ten most abundant classes, Cytophagia (bacterial) and Chromadorea (eukaryal) were specific to the sediment environment, whereas Cyanobacteria and Bacteroidia (bacterial) and Chlorophyceae (eukaryal) were specific to the seawater environment. A total of 47 unique genera were observed to comprise the core taxa community across environment types and sites. No archaeal taxa were observed as part of either the abundant or core taxa. No significant differences were observed for sediment community composition across domains or between sites. For seawater, the bacterial and archaeal community composition was statistically different for the Major Outlet site (p < 0.05), the site closest to a residential area, and the eukaryal community composition was statistically different between all sites (p < 0.05).

However, the extent to which these mechanisms differ in importance based on traits of taxa with different niche breadth is poorly understood. Here, we used high-throughput sequencing to examine the relative importance of environmental selection and stochastic processes in shaping soil bacterial sub-communities with different niche breadth (including habitat generalists, specialists and other taxa) across elevational gradients on the subalpine slope of Mount Wutai, Northern China. Our findings suggested that the composition of soil bacterial communities differed significantly different among elevational gradients. According to the niche breadth index, 10.9% of OTUs were defined as habitat generalists (B-value >8.7) and 10.0% of OTUs were defined as habitat specialists (B-value <1.5). Generalists and specialists differed distinctly in diversity and biogeographic patterns across elevational gradients. Environmental selection (deterministic processes) and spatial factors (stochastic processes) seemed to determine the assembly and biogeography of habitat generalists. However, for specialists, deterministic processes strongly influenced the distribution, while stochastic processes were not at play. Environmental drivers for generalists and specialists differed, as did their importance. Elevation, total nitrogen and pH were the main factors determining habitat generalists, and soil water content, nitrate nitrogen and pH had the strongest impacts on specialists. Moreover, variation partitioning analysis revealed that environmental selection had a much greater impact on both generalists (17.7% of pure variance was explained) and specialists (3.6%) than spatial factors. However, generalists had a much stronger response to spatial factors (2.3%) than specialists (0.3%). More importantly, null models of s-diversity suggested that specialists deviated significantly from non-neutral assembly mechanisms (relative null deviation= 0.64-0.74) relative to generalists (0.16-0.65) (P < 0.05). These results indicate that generalists and specialists are governed by different assembly mechanisms and present distinct biogeographical patterns. The large proportion of unexplained variation in specialists (93.3%) implies that very complex assembly mechanisms exist in the assembly of specialists across elevational gradients on the subalpine slope of Mount Wutai. It is essential to understand the microbial community assembly at a more refined level, and to expand the current understanding of microbial ecological mechanisms.","2019","10","10.3389/fmicb.2019.00169","me","not yet"

Soil microbial communities were also locally analysed according to environmental variables, including geological, physico-chemical, biogeochemically, and climatic data. Typical soil characteristics, climate data, and plant composition clearly split the two sites and major differences among the microbial communities for the areas were initially expected. Overall, high values of microbial species richness (up to 2300 taxa) and ecological diversity was detected in both sites. High genetic novelty levels were found mostly to environmental sequences, highlighting the high potential for microbiological studies. In contrast to the initial expectations, a substantial overlapping between Monegros and Gallocanta microbes was observed, indicating a high similarity despite of the geographical, botanical and environmental distances between sites, in agreement with both high dispersal and local selection inherent to the microbial world. The potential biogeochemical cycling showed small differences between sites, with presence of photosynthetic green and purple sulfur bacteria, cyanobacteria and aerobic and anaerobic chemolitotrophs. Potential for aerobic methane oxidation and anaerobic methanogenesis was observed in both sites, with predominance of potential nitrification mostly by ammonia-oxidizing archaea, nitrite oxidation and denitrification, and minor contribution for nitrate reduction and nitrate ammonification.

Imbalances of the microbial populations, called dysbiosis, are related to several pathological status, emphasizing the importance of understanding the gut bacterial ecology. Among the ecological drivers of the microbiota, the spatial structure of the colon is of special interest: spatio-temporal mechanisms can lead to the constitution of spatial interactions among the bacterial populations and of environmental niches that impact the overall colonization of the colon. In the present study, we introduce a mathematical model of the colon microbiota in its fluid environment, based on the explicit coupling of a population dynamics model of microbial populations involved in fibre degradation with a fluid dynamics model of the luminal content. This modeling framework is used to study the main drivers of the spatial structure of the microbiota, specially focusing on the dietary fibre inflow, the epithelial motility, the microbial active swimming and viscosity gradients in the digestive track. We found 1) that the viscosity gradients allow the creation of favorable niches in the vicinity of the mucus layer; 2) that very low microbial active swimming in the radial direction is enough to promote bacterial growth, which sheds a new light on microbial motility in the colon and 3) that dietary fibres are the main driver of the spatial structure of the microbiota in the distal bowel whereas epithelial motility is preponderant for the colonization of the proximal colon; in the transverse colon, fibre levels and chemotaxis have the strongest impact on the distribution of the microbial communities.

Long-distance dispersal might also spread micro-organisms across large geographical areas. However, so far, to which extent selection mechanisms that shape hosts population genetics are mirrored in the population structure of the enteric microbiome remains unclear. High dispersal rates and horizontal parental transfer may homogenize bacterial communities between breeding sites (homogeneous hypothesis). Alternatively, strong selection from the local environment may differentiate bacterial communities between breeding sites (heterogeneous hypothesis). Furthermore, selection from age-specific environmental or physiological factors may differentiate the microbiome between juveniles and adults. Here, we analyzed the cloacal bacterial 16S rRNA gene of fledgling greater flamingos, Phoenicopterus roseus, across nine western Mediterranean breeding sites and four breeding seasons (n = 731) and adult birds (n = 27) from a single site. We found that fledgling cloacal microbiome, as measured by alpha diversity, beta diversity, the relative abundance of assigned sequence variants (ASVs) belonging to a phylum and genus composition within phylum, varied significantly between sampling sites and across time within site despite high adult dispersal rates. The spatio-temporal effects were stronger on individual ASV absence/presence than on ASV abundance (i.e., than on core microbiome composition). Spatial effects had a stronger effect than temporal effects, particularly on ASV abundance. Our study supports the heterogeneous hypothesis whereby local environmental conditions select and differentiate bacterial communities, thus countering the homogenizing effects of high-dispersing host species. In addition, differences in core microbiome between adult vs. fledgling samples suggests that differences in age-specific environmental and/or physiological factors result in differential selection pressure of core enteric microbiome between age classes, even within the same environment. In particular, the genus Corynebacterium, associated with both seasonal fat uptake and migration in previous studies, was much more abundant in high-dispersing fledglings than in more resident adults. To conclude, selection mechanisms that shape the hosts genetic structure cannot be extended to the genetic structure of the enteric microbiome, which has important implications regarding our understanding of both host local adaptation mechanisms and enteric microbiome population genetics.","2019","10","10.3389/fmicb.2019.00035","me","not yet"

From a previous 18S rRNA gene pyrosequencing dataset of the benthic microeukaryotes, we retrieved the sequences affiliated with phylum Ciliophora and analyzed alpha and beta diversities of ciliate communities. We found that BHS had the highest ciliate operational taxonomic unit (OTU) richness than NYS and SYS, whereas the richness was not significantly different between summer and winter. Among all the measured environmental variables, water depth showed consistently the strongest correlations with alpha diversities. Overall, the class Spirotrichea (mostly Choreotrichia and unassigned lineages within the class) dominated the communities in terms of both relative proportion of sequences (77.0%) and OTU richness (66.5%). OTU-level ciliate community structure was significant different among the three basins, but not between the seasons. Structurally, significant differences in relative proportion among the basins were detected for the class Litostomatea, but not for other classes. Partial Mantel tests demonstrated that water depth difference was more important than geographic and environment distances in shaping the community structure of benthic ciliates in the studied area. About 60% OTUs were not assigned at a class or order level and at least 45% OTUs shared a sequence similarity no more than 97% with the described species, indicating a great potential for ciliate species discovery in the offshore sediments. Compared with previous morphology-based surveys, the spatial pattern of ciliate diversity (decreasing from NYS to SYS) is also identified in the present study. Nevertheless, structurally, the dominant class appeared to be Spirotrichea in the sequencing dataset, which differs from previous morphology-based results (dominance of classes Prostomatea and Karyorelictea in biomass). The potential causes for the discrepancies between molecular and morphological findings are also discussed.","2019","38","10.1007/s13131-018-1236-y","me","not yet"

Alpha-, Beta- and Gammaproteobacteria and Acidobacteria were the proportionally dominant bacterial taxa, as in previous studies. Pre-colonising wood with decay fungi had a clear effect on the bacterial community, apparently via direct fungal influence; the bacterial and fungal communities present at the time of collection explained nearly 60% of their mutual covariance. Site was less important than fungal influence in determining bacterial communities, but the effects of pre-colonisation were more pronounced at some sites than at others. Wood pH was also a strong bacterial predictor, but was itself under considerable fungal influence. Burkholderiaceae and Acidobacteriaceae showed directional responses against the trend of the bacterial community as a whole.

The goal of this study was to characterize how soil bacterial communities vary across diurnal, sub-seasonal and seasonal time-scales in a 5.8 m(2) plot and test the hypothesis that bacterial diversity varies on each of these scales. We used 16S rDNA gene amplicon sequencing to quantify the alpha and beta diversity of soil bacteria as well as the Net Relatedness Index and Nearest Taxon Indices to assess the degree of phylogenetic clustering, and the extent to which community shifts were driven by stochastic vs. deterministic limitation. We found that species richness was highest in winter, lowest in fall and that communities were compositionally distinct across seasons. There was no evidence of diurnal-scale shifts; the finest temporal scale over which community shifts were detected using our DNA-based analysis was between sampling dates separated by 6 weeks. Phylogenetic analyses suggested that seasonal-scale differences in community composition were the result of environmental filtering and homogeneous selection. Our findings provide insight into temporal variation of soil bacterial communities across the hourly to seasonal scales while minimizing the potential confounding effect of spatial variation.

Here, we investigated bacterial distribution across a high elevational gradient (4328-5228 m a.s.l.) along the Nyainqentanglha mountains on the Southwestern Tibetan Plateau. We found a decreasing diversity trend with increasing elevation, with pH contributing most to the diversity variation, followed by elevation and mean annual temperature (MAT). Bacterial community composition differed taxonomically and phylogenetically with elevation. Furthermore, partial Mantel analyzes showed that bacterial community composition was significantly influenced by elevation, pH and MAT. Phylogenetic structure analysis indicated that deterministic processes (related to pH) determined bacterial community assembly along this elevation gradient. Our results reinforce the observed rule that pH is of foremost importance in driving bacterial elevational diversity patterns. We also suggest that absence of tree cover and of human disturbance might be important in allowing an underlying elevational trend to reveal itself. Review of other studies suggests that the trend of decreasing diversity at higher elevations might be generally true above the tree line.

Followed by qualitative and/or quantitative analysis of their secondary metabolites. 50 soil bacteria were affected to the two groups of fluorescent (72%) and non-fluorescent Pseudomonads (28%). The UPGMA (Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean) showed five phenons of carbon sources assimilation; at the time that BOX-PCR profiling resulted in five clusters characterized by 29 different haplotypes. (66%) isolates induced phosphate solubilization; (24%) were HCN producers, (21%) showed IAA production and all isolates had produced siderophores. In vitro antibacterial activity against Xapf showed 26.67 and 24mm of inhibition zone using the two isolates P. grimontii P25 and P. cepatia P7, respectively. Similarly, the same isolates significantly reduced Xapf-bean common blight intensity, while their co-inoculation was less effective. The isolate P. cepatia P7 was highly effective on seed germination and root growth properties, then P. grimontii P25. Thus, the selected isolates could play a crucial bean growth promotion and bean common blight biocontrol as alternative to chemicals for crop yield enhancement.","2019","153","10.1007/s10658-018-1566-9","me","not yet"

However, it remains unclear how and to which extent it affects aquatic microbial communities, especially in heavily polluted rivers. In this study, a significant environmental gradient, particularly nitrogen gradient, was observed along a wastewater receiving river, the North Canal River (NCR). The pollution level was highest, moderate, and lowest in the up-, middle, and clown streams, respectively. The community composition of bacterioplankton transitioned from being Betaproteobacteria-dominated upstream to Gammaproteobacteria-dominated downstream. Copiotrophic groups, such as Polynucleobacter (Betaproteobacteria) and Hydrogenophaga (Betaproteobacteria), were dominant in the upstream. Multiple statistical analyses indicated that total nitrogen (TN) was the most important factor driving the adaptive shifts of community structure. Analyses of co-occurrence networks showed that the complexity of networks was disrupted in the up- and middle streams, while enhanced in the downstream. Our findings here suggested that microbial interactions were reduced in response to the aggravation of nutrient pollution. Similar to these changes, we observed significant dissimilarity of composition of functional groups, with highest abundance of nitrogen metabolism members under the highest level of nitrogen enrichment. Further analyses indicated that most of these functional groups belonged to Betaproteobacteria, suggesting the potential coupling of community composition and function diversity. In summary, adaptive shifts of bacterioplankton community composition, as well as species interactions, occurred in response to nutrient pollution in highly polluted water bodies.

"Gruber, A","Whats in a name? How organelles of endosymbiotic origin can be distinguished from endosymbionts","MICROBIAL CELL","Mitochondria and plastids evolved from free-living bacteria, but are now considered integral parts of the eukaryotic species in which they live. Therefore, they are implicitly called by the same eukaryotic species name. Historically, mitochondria and plastids were known as organelles, even before their bacterial origin became fully established. However, since organelle evolution by endosymbiosis has become an established theory in biology, more and more endosymbiotic systems have been discovered that show various levels of host/symbiont integration. In this context, the distinction between host/symbiont and eukaryote/organelle systems is currently unclear. The criteria that are commonly considered are genetic integration (via gene transfer from the endosymbiont to the nucleus), cellular integration (synchronization of the cell cycles), and metabolic integration (the mutual dependency of the metabolisms). Here, I suggest that these criteria should be evaluated according to the resulting coupling of genetic recombination between individuals and congruence of effective population sizes, which determines if independent speciation is possible for either of the partners. I would like to call this aspect of integration sexual symbiont integration. If the partners lose their independence in speciation, I think that they should be considered one species. The partner who maintains its genetic recombination mechanisms and life cycle should then be the name giving host; the other one would be the organelle. Distinguishing between organelles and symbionts according to their sexual symbiont integration is independent of any particular mechanism or structural property of the endosymbiont/host system under investigation.","2019","6","10.15698/mic2019.02.668","me","not yet"

We developed state-factor models with machine learning to understand better and to predict the abundance of 10 dominant phyla and bacterial diversities in Australian soils, the latter expressed by the Chao and Shannon indices. In the models, we used proxies for the edaphic, climatic, biotic and topographic factors, which included soil properties, environmental variables, and the absorbance at visible-near infrared (vis-NIR) wavelengths. From a cross-validation with all observations (n = 681), we found that our models explained 43-73% of the variance in bacterial phyla abundance and diversity. The vis-NIR spectra, which represent the organic and mineral composition of soil, were prominent drivers of abundance and diversity in the models, as were changes in the soil-water balance, potential evapotranspiration, and soil nutrients. From independent validations, we found that spectr-otransfer functions could predict well the phyla Acidobacteria and Actinobacteria (R-2 > 0.7) as well as other dominant phyla and the Chao and Shannon diversities (R-2 > 0.5). Predictions of the phyla Firmicutes were the poorest (R-2 = 0.42).

In Prochlorococcus, there is a clear phylogenetic hierarchy of ecotypes, whereas multiple Synechococcus clades have overlapping physiologies and environmental distributions. However, microbial traits are associated with different phylogenetic depths. Using this principle, we reclassified diversity at different phylogenetic levels and compared the phylogeography. We sequenced the genetic diversity of Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus from 339 samples across the tropical Pacific Ocean and North Atlantic Ocean using a highly variable phylogenetic marker gene (rpoC1). We observed clear parallel niche distributions of ecotypes leading to high Piankas Index values driven by distinct shifts at two transition points. The first transition point at 6 degrees N distinguished ecotypes adapted to warm waters but separated by macronutrient content. At 39 degrees N, ecotypes adapted to warm, low macronutrient vs. colder, high macronutrient waters shifted. Finally, we detected parallel vertical and regional single-nucleotide polymorphism microdiversity within clades from both Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus, suggesting uniquely adapted populations at very specific depths, as well as between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Overall, this study demonstrates that Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus have shared phylogenetic organization of traits and associated phylogeography.","2019","13","10.1038/s41396-018-0287-6","me","not yet"

This study examined the influence of soil physico-chemical properties and topographic features on bacterial communities and diversity in a commercial potato field with a rolling landform. Eighty-three soil samples were systematically collected across a transect 1100 m long. A significant negative correlation (r = -0.73) between soil pH (range 4.3-7.0) and slope gradient (range 1.8-11.9%) was observed. Regressions and/or a canonical correspondence analysis showed that pH, slope gradient and organic carbon were the major factors influencing bacterial a-diversity based on 16S rRNA gene sequences. Semivariogram analyses revealed that the bacterial adiversity, the relative abundance of most phyla, pH and slope gradient showed strong to medium spatial autocorrelations with a range between 20.8 and 217.8 m. These results evidenced that soil pH and slope gradient were the major factors explaining variation in the spatial structure of the bacterial community. Our results showed that the soil bacterial communities varied in a systematic and predictable pattern in an agricultural field in response to variation in soil physico-chemical properties and topographic features.","2019","335","10.1016/j.geoderma.2018.08.016","me","not yet"

Bacteria are important to this symbiosis, with diverse functions such as providing nutrients to the symbiont and pathogen protection to the cnidarian. Disrupted bacterial communities are associated with thermally stressed cnidarians, which have a higher likelihood of expelling their symbionts, an event called bleaching. To better understand the association between thermal tolerance and bacterial community structure, we studied communities associated with an exceptionally thermal tolerant cnidarian, Anthopleura elegantissima. This intertidal symbiotic sea anemone is distributed from the subtropical waters of Baja California to subarctic Alaska, and experiences daily temperature fluctuations of up to 20 degrees C. It is also flexible in its symbioses, predominantly hosting Symbiodinium, but occasionally hosting the green algae Elliptochloris marina or existing without symbionts in an aposymbiotic state. We used 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to characterize the natural variation of microbial communities associated with Anthopleura elegantissima in these three symbiotic states and across a latitudinal gradient. In this study, we identified a core microbiome, made up predominantly of low-abundance taxa. We found that the communities associated with A. elegantissima were weakly linked to latitude. Diversity analyses revealed significantly higher species richness values for microbial communities associated with anemones hosting E. marina. Lastly the microbiome communities associated with different symbiotic states were compositionally distinct. Taken together, our results suggest that the structure of microbial communities associated with these temperate cnidarians is tightly linked to symbiotic state and weakly linked to other biogeographic phenomena.","2019","6","10.3389/fmars.2019.00007","me","not yet"
"Ma, ZS; Li, LW","Semen Microbiome Biogeography: An Analysis Based on a Chinese Population Study","FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY","Investigating inter-subject heterogeneity (or spatial distribution) of human semen microbiome diversity is of important significance. Theoretically, the spatial distribution of biodiversity constitutes the core of microbiome biogeography. Practically, the inter-subject heterogeneity is crucial for understanding the normal (healthy) flora of semen microbiotas as well as their possible changes associated with abnormal fertility. In this article, we analyze the scaling (changes) of semen microbiome diversity across individuals with DAR (diversity-area relationship) analysis, a recent extension to classic SAR (species-area relationship) law in biogeography and ecology. Specifically, the unit of area is individual subject, and the microbial diversity in seminal fluid of an individual (area) is assessed via metagenomic DNA sequencing technique and measured in the Hill numbers. The DAR models were then fitted to the accrued diversity across different number of individuals (area size). We further tested the difference in DAR parameters among the healthy, subnormal, and abnormal microbiome samples in terms of their fertility status based on a cross-sectional study of a Chinese cohort. Given that no statistically significant differences in the DAR parameters were detected among the three groups, we built unified DAR models for semen microbiome by combining the healthy, subnormal, and abnormal groups. The model parameters were used to (i) estimate the microbiome diversity scaling in a population (cohort), and construct the so-termed DAR profile; (ii) predict/construct the maximal accrual diversity (MAD) profile in a population; (iii) estimate the pair-wise diversity overlap (PDO) between two individuals and construct the PDO profile; (iv) assess the ratio of individual diversity to population (RIP) accrual diversity. The last item(RIP) is a new concept we propose in this study, which is essentially a ratio of local diversity to regional or global diversity (LRD/LGD), applicable to general biodiversity investigation beyond human microbiome.","2019","9","10.3389/fmicb.2018.03333","me","not yet"

To provide a broader biogeographical context of archaeal diversity, this study quantified the abundance and community composition of archaea across the black soil zone in northeast China using real-time PCR and high-throughput sequencing (HTS) methods. Archaeal abundances across all soil samples ranged from 4.04 x 10(7)to 26.18 x 10(7)16S rRNA gene copies per gram of dry soil. Several soil factors were positively correlated with the abundances including soil pH, concentrations of total C, N, and P, and available Kin soil, and soil water content. Approximately 94.2, 5.7, and 0.3% of archaeal sequences, and 31, 151, and 3 OTUs aligned within the phyla Thaumarchaeota, Euryarchaeota, and Crenarchaeota, respectively. Within the phylum of Thaumarchaeota, group 1.1b was a dominating genus accounting for an average of 87% archaeal sequences and phylogenetically classified as Nitrososphaera, a genus of ammonia oxidizing archaea. The response of dominating OTUs to environmental factors differed greatly, suggesting the physiological characteristics of different archaeal members is diversified in the black soils. Although the number of OTUs was not related with any particular soil parameters, the number of OTUs within Thaumarchaeota and Euryarchaeota was marginally related with soil pH. Archaeal community compositions differed between samples, and a Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) analysis indicated that soil pH and the latitude of sampling locations were two dominating factors in shifting community structures. A variance partitioning analysis (VPA) analysis showed that the selected soil parameters (32%) were the largest drivers of community variation, in particular soil pH (21%), followed by geographic distances (19%). These findings suggest that archaeal communities have distinct biogeographic distribution pattern in the black soil zone and soil pH was the key edaphic factor in structuring the community compositions.","2019","10","10.3389/fmicb.2019.00023","me","not yet"

We investigated 71 sites based on their range of variation in soil properties (pH, texture and organic matter), climatic conditions (Atlantic, alpine, boreal, continental, Mediterranean) and land uses (arable, forest and grassland). 16S rRNA gene amplicon pyrosequencing revealed that bacterial communities highly varied in diversity, richness, and structure according to environmental factors. At the European scale, taxa area relationship (TAR) was significant, supporting spatial structuration of bacterial communities. Spatial variations in community diversity and structure were mainly driven by soil physicochemical parameters. Within soil clusters (k-means approach) corresponding to similar edaphic and climatic properties, but to multiple land uses, land use was a major driver of the bacterial communities. Our analyses identified specific indicators of land use (arable, forest, grasslands) or soil conditions (pH, organic C, texture).

Within these relict deposits, ancient microbial mats, or paleomats, have been preserved under extremely arid and cold conditions since the receding of larger paleolakes thousands of years ago, and now serve as a sheltered niche for microbes in a highly challenging oligotrophic environment. To explore whether paleomats could be repositories for ancient lake cells or were later colonized by soil microbes, determine what types of metabolic pathways might be present, analyze potential gene expression, and explore whether the cells are in a vegetative or dormant state, we collected paleomat samples from ancient lake facies on the northern slopes of Lake Vanda in Wright Valley in December 2016. Using a gentle lysis technique optimized to preserve longer molecules, combined with a polyenzymatic treatment to maximize yields from different cell types, we isolated high-molecular weight DNA and RNA from ancient paleomat samples. Community composition analysis suggests that the paleomat community may retain a population of indigenousmat cells that may flourish once more favorable conditions are met. In addition to harboring a diverse microbial community, paleomats appear to host heterotrophs in surrounding soils utilizing the deposits as a carbon source. Whole genome long-read PacBio sequencing of native DNA and Illumina metagenomic sequencing of size-sorted DNA (>2,500 nt) indicated possible cell viability, with mat community composed of bacterial taxa.

Most of the existing research focused on grape berries microbiota, since it can directly impact wine quality. In this work we studied, for the first time through next-generation sequencing, the epiphytic bacterial community of vine bark and its relationships with grape microbiota. The study was carried out in two Italian wine appellations (situated in different regions) to explore the impact of biogeography, and the influence of two agronomical practices (biodynamic and conventional) was evaluated as well. Overall, our results show that grapevine bark harbors a rich epiphytic microbiota and displays a higher microbial biodiversity than grape berry. Moreover, this study suggests that geographic and anthropogenic factors impact both bark and grape bacteriomes, but to a different extent. The evidence of a microbial terror seems to be even more marked in bark than in berries, possibly due to its permanence over time and to its physical proximity with soil. The importance of vine trunk bark, as potential source of inoculum for grapes and as interesting bacterial diversity habitat, is evidenced. This opens new fields of investigation, not only for researchers that aim at describing this little-known habitat within the vineyard, but also for stakeholders from the wine industry that want to understand the roles of microorganisms on the entire winemaking process, from vineyard to cellar.","2019","9","10.3389/fmicb.2018.03203","me","not yet"

The alpha-diversity of the bacterial community in the rhizosphere was significantly higher than that of the bulk soils suggesting that bulk soil lacks plant nurturing effect under the current study conditions. Black and red soils were enriched with nitrifying and nitrogen-fixing bacteria but the soda-saline-alkali soil suspension had more denitrifying bacteria, which may reflect agronomic unsuitability of the latter. We also observed a high abundance of Bradyrhizobium and Pseudomonas, enriched cellulolytic bacteria, as well as a highly connected molecular ecological network in the G. soja rhizosphere soil. Taken all, the current study suggest that wild soybeans may have evolved to recruit beneficial microbes in its rhizosphere that can promote nutrients requisition, biostasis and disease-resistance, therefore ecologically more resilient than cultivated soybeans.","2019","65","10.1080/03650340.2018.1485147","me","not yet"

DOM quantity and quality are key determinants of microbial community structure in streams and have been linked to changes in community abundance and composition. Considering the vital ecological role sediment microbes play in stream ecosystems, it is important to understand how agricultural land use changes affect stream microbial community structure. This study was conducted to determine if variation in sediment microbial biomass community structure could be attributed to differences in agricultural land use. Microbial biomass, microbial community structure, and stream water parameters were compared on 2 dates from 6 sites representing a gradient of agricultural land use from 18 to 64 % within the Bear Creek Watershed in northwest Alabama, USA. Total microbial biomass, determined as phospholipid phosphate, was strongly influenced by sediment surface area and, to a lesser extent, correlated with sampling date and land use. Sediment microbial community structure, determined by phospholipid fatty acid analysis, was significantly correlated to percent agricultural land use in the watershed, as well as stream water DOM humification index, and sediment delta N-15 values and surface area. Microbial community structure also differed between sampling dates. These findings demonstrate that agricultural land use is linked via alteration of stream water and sediment organic matter to changes in sediment microbial structure which may, at least in part, account for widely observed changes in stream ecosystem functioning associated with agricultural activities.","2019","83","10.3354/ame01905","me","not yet"

Area of study: The study was carried out at two locations (San Antonio Cayal and Nuevo Progreso municipalities) of Campeche State, Mexico. Material and methods: Two experimental stages were performed: 1) isolation, morphological and biochemical characterization, and molecular identification of endophytic bacteria from root-nodules of four soybean varieties grown at field conditions; and 2) evaluation of the effects of endophytic isolates on soybean growth and nodule development, and the effects of bacterial co-inoculation on soybean plants, under controlled conditions. Main results: Twenty-three endophytic bacteria were isolated from root nodules, and identified as Agrobacterium, Bradyrhizobium, Rhizobium, Ensifer, Massilia, Chryseobacterium, Enterobacter, Microbacterium, Serratia, and Xanthomonas.

"Jian, HH; Xiao, X","Characteristics and ecological functions of deep-sea viruses","CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE","Believed to be the most abundant (similar to 10(30)) biological agents in the ocean, viruses play an important role in microbial metabolism, prokaryotic mortality, and nutrient recycling in marine ecosystems, thereby significantly influencing the geochemical cycles of our planet. The importance of viruses in the surface ocean has been well recognized, however we are just beginning to understand the viral role and the underlying mechanism in the deep ocean. As an essential part of the marine environment, the abyssal ocean has extensive material and energy exchanges with the upper ocean and the deep biosphere, and they constitute an integral whole of the marine ecosystem. With an average depth of approximately 3800 m, the benthic environment is characterized by total darkness, low temperature (<4 degrees C), and high hydrostatic pressure (>10 MPa). The deep-sea inhabited microorganisms, including viruses, are believed to develop unique strategy to survive under multiple extreme environmental stresses. Studies on deep-sea viruses have revealed their abundance, diversity, and important ecological functions. In this review, advances in research on deep-sea viruses are summarized into four parts: general features, relationship between environmental factors and deep-sea viruses, isolation and characterization of representative viruses, and significant influences of the viriobenthos on the physiological and ecological function of deepsea microorganisms. In general, the functions of viruses in the deep-sea environment mainly include two aspects: First, the regulation of material and energy cycle (viral shunt) and the dynamic change in ecosystem composition (balance of microbial communities) modulated by viral lysis; second, the expression of viral metabolic related genes (auxiliary metabolism) and the effect of viruses on host physiological activities (environmental adaptability). The former has been widely recognized, but the influence and molecular mechanism of the latter in the extreme deep-sea environment need to be further investigated. Here, we propose research directions and challenges in this field to undertake in future studies. Notably, the relationship between environmental factors and deep-sea viruses remains poorly understood. A deep-sea viral-host model system must be developed to investigate the underlying regulatory mechanism of gene expression and the interaction between deep-sea viruses and their hosts under extreme environmental conditions. At present, the number of isolated deep-sea viruses is less than 30, which is below 1% of the total number of viruses in the International Virus Classification Database. In terms of classification, most of the isolated deep-sea viruses belong to Caudovirales, and nearly no representatives have been identified yet from other viral orders. Furthermore, deep-sea viruses have been rarely subjected to in-depth study possibly because of very few benthic microorganisms with genetic operating system. In addition to maximizing the use of existing virus-host systems, scholars must focus on isolating other representative deepsea viruses. Although our understanding on viriobenthos is still far from complete, data provided here encourage us to hypothesize that viruses are the key component of the benthic ecosystem and play an indispensable role in the deep ocean and deep biosphere.","2019","64","10.1360/N972018-01150","me","not yet"

Among the four alpine grassland types (i.e. alpine meadow, alpine steppe, alpine shrub and alpine desert) sampled in this study, alpine meadow had the highest soil microbial biomass and alpine desert had the lowest soil microbial richness and Shannon diversity. The soil microbial diversity in the alpine grassland correlated with plant diversity and climate factors. Soil microbial diversity negatively correlated with the annual average air temperature, but was not correlated with the annual average precipitation, indicating that temperature, rather than precipitation, may be more important in controlling the soil microbial diversity in alpine grassland ecosystems at cold temperatures. Higher air temperature likely led to an intensified aridity under limited precipitation, and thus decreased microbial diversity. As a result, the aridity index combined with temperature and precipitation explained more of the variance in the soil microbial diversity than air temperature or precipitation did individually. Moreover, after separating plant species into four functional groups (grass, forb, legume and sedge), microbial diversity positively correlated with plant functional group diversity, explaining more of the variance in microbial diversity than plant species diversity did. Results of structural equation modeling revealed that the aridity index and annual air temperature affected soil microbial diversity, directly or indirectly, through influencing plant functional group diversity and aboveground biomass; while aboveground biomass changed the soil carbon to nitrogen ratio in the upper soil layers and thus impacted soil microbial diversity. However, in contrast to microbial diversity, soil microbial biomass carbon was not correlated with plant functional group diversity, plant species diversity, or the climate factors annual average air temperature, annual precipitation and aridity index, but were linked to soil nutrient status (e.g. soil dissolved organic carbon, ammonia, available phosphorus, and carbon to nitrogen ratio) and plant biomass of sedges and forbs, demonstrating that microbial biomass and diversity were likely controlled by different factors. In summary, this study investigated the spatial patterns of soil microbial communities across different alpine grassland ecosystem types on the Tibetan Plateau and enhanced our understanding of biotic and abiotic factors controlling microbial biomass and diversity, which will be important in predicting microbial changes on the Tibetan Plateau under future climate change. Under future warming and wetting scenarios on the Tibetan Plateau, it is possible that the aridity index would decrease, leading to increased soil microbial diversity. Results of this study also suggest a focus on the aridity index and plant functional group diversity in future microbial biogeography studies in order to further determine their roles in controlling or mediating soil microbial biomass and diversity.","2019","64","10.1360/TB-2019-0090","me","not yet"

To study the effect of prolonged environmental changes, a 25 m long sediment core was excavated from a paleo beach ridge located on the Cauvery delta, south east coast of India. Geological evidences suggested that the site has experienced multiple marine transgressions and regressions. The three paleosols from Vettaikaraniruppu (VKI) beach ridge, VKI-2 (2.8 m bgl; 3 kybp), VKI-5 (7.2 m bgl; 6 kybp) and VKI-14 (24.5 m bgl; 146 kybp) was chosen for bacterial community analysis based on their formation period. Bacterial community structure of paleosols was reconstructed using V3 hypervariable region of bacterial 16S rDNA targeted Illumina sequencing, The VKI-5 sediment layer which formed under marine environment contained highest bacterial diversity, and the community was a mix up of terrestrial and marine bacterial population. The final community VKI-2 exhibited an approximate structural pattern witnessed in the native bacterial community VKI-14 which formed during marine regression. Furthermore, marine transgression and regression experienced in VKI resulted in the formation of distinct biogeographic patterns.","2019","226","10.1016/j.micres.2019.06.001","me","not yet"

The fungal community was analyzed using the molecular technique polymerase chain reaction (PCR) - denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). The number of bands (S) and Jaccard similarity coefficient were determined from band profiles of DGGE gels. The profiles obtained from amplification of DNA fragments allowed identifying unique species in the first 5 cm of the soil for MA, AC and PN uses as well as for MA and PN from 5 to 20 cm depth. On the other hand, shared fragments were observed among the three soil uses. The dendrogram identified two groups, with similarity coefficient close to 35%. The molecular profiles determined that the PN community differed from those of MA and AC, which are closer to each other.

Here we report, using molecular and microscopic approaches, the first description of snow algae communities inhabiting penitente ice at 5,277 m a.s.l., demonstrating a new habitat for snow algae in one of the most extreme environments on Earth. Red ice patches on penitentes contained a microbial community dominated by algae in the genera Chlamydomonas and Chloromonas, both of which were closely related to known snow algae from alpine and polar environments. In contrast, we obtained few snow algae sequences from clear ice, but we did find cyanobacteria sequences and evidence of aeolian-deposited organic matter. Tephra (soil) within and just downhill from the penitente field hosted more complex bacterial and eukaryotic communities that were significantly different from ice communities in terms of both alpha and beta diversity. In this environment penitentes provide both water and shelter from harsh winds, high UV radiation, and thermal fluctuations, creating an oasis in an otherwise extreme landscape. Intriguingly, recent planetary investigations have suggested the existence of penitente-like structures on other planetary bodies of our solar system. Therefore, penitentes and the harsh environment that surrounds them provide a new terrestrial analog for astrobiological studies of life beyond Earth.","2019","51","10.1080/15230430.2019.1618115","me","not yet"
"Els, N; Baumann-Stanzer, K; Larose, C; Vogel, TM; Sattler, B","Beyond the planetary boundary layer: Bacterial and fungal vertical biogeography at Mount Sonnblick, Austria","GEO-GEOGRAPHY AND ENVIRONMENT","The atmosphere harbours a vast diversity of primary biological aerosols (PBAs) that are subjected to vertical and horizontal dispersal mechanisms that are not fully understood. In addition to size and weight constraints on PBAs to be lifted into the air column, local meteorological features dominate the fate of bioaerosols and their possible inclusion in long-range transport. For organic particles to be included into long distant dispersal, they have to overcome surface vertical mixing of the planetary boundary layer (PBL) to reach levels of laminar air movement. Hence, the biogeography of PBAs along a vertical distribution through the PBL needed further study. To assess the microbial biodiversity along an altitudinal gradient, air samples were collected between 1,000 and 3,100 m above sea level at Mount Sonnblick in the Austrian Alps. 16S rRNA gene and internal transcribed spacer sequencing for bacteria and fungi, respectively, were used to define distinct microbial communities that were separated by the PBL. Up to the top of the PBL, plant-associated bacteria and fungi were detected and were subjected to limited vertical dispersal due to size-constraints. This indicates that those communities become aerosolised but were not lifted into higher altitudes. However, a variety of ubiquitous, thermophilic strains that are often identified with heavy dust events and high endurance towards extreme conditions were significantly increased (relative abundance) at higher elevations. The lack of information on vertical dispersal is due to reliance on ground-based investigations that bias the interpretation of dispersal dynamics. Thus, to understand the mechanisms for near-ground communities to become airborne and subsequently included in long-range transport, we recommend investigating meteorological driving forces for an improved biogeographical assessment. Here, we show, for the first time, an assessment of the biogeography of bacterial and fungal assemblages along a vertical alpine air column transect.","2019","6","10.1002/geo2.69","me","not yet"

Here, quantitative polymerase chain reaction and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism were used to determine the spatial distribution of free-living nitrogen-fixing bacteria along a slope gradient. Plant communities were evaluated through field surveys, and basic soil properties were measured in the laboratory. Soil properties (e.g., soil available phosphorus, soil organic carbon, and total nitrogen) were higher in upper-and middle -slope soils than in lower-slope soils, while bacterial abundance was the opposite. Bacterial and plant communities all varied along the slope gradient. Redundancy analysis revealed that bacterial community composition was closely linked to pH, soil organic carbon, available phosphorus, and total nitrogen. These results indicate that free-living nitrogen-fixing bacterial communities show strong spatial structure along a slope gradient, and emphasize the importance of soil heterogeneity in affecting bacterial spatial patterns in a karst region.","2019","28","10.15244/pjoes/94383","me","not yet"

The present study was conducted to investigate the diversity, composition, and function of both entire and potentially active archaeal communities within Pacific deep-sea sediments. For this purpose, sediment samples were taken along the 180 degrees meridian of the central Pacific Ocean. Community composition and diversity were assessed by Illumina tag sequencing targeting archaeal 16S rRNA genes and transcripts. Archaeal communities were dominated by Candidatus Nitrosopumilus (Thaumarchaeota) and other members of the Nitrosopumilaceae (Thaumarchaeota), but higher relative abundances of the Marine Group II (Euryarchaeota) were observed in the active compared to the entire archaeal community. The composition of the entire and the active archaeal communities was strongly linked to primary production (chlorophyll content), explaining more than 40% of the variance. Furthermore, we found a strong correlation of the entire archaeal community composition to latitude and silicic acid content, while the active community was significantly correlated with primary production and ferric oxide content. We predicted functional profiles from 16S rRNA data to assess archaeal community functions. Latitude was significantly correlated with functional profiles of the entire community, whereas those of the active community were significantly correlated with nitrate and chlorophyll content. The results of the present study provide first insights into benthic archaeal communities in the Pacific Ocean and environmental conditions shaping their diversity, distribution, and function.

To test the hypothesis that BEs impose selective pressures resulting in characteristic adaptive responses, we performed a pangenomics meta-analysis leveraging 189 genomes (accessed from GenBank) of two epidemiologically important taxa, Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus, isolated from various origins: the International Space Station (ISS; a model BE), Earth-based BEs, soil, and humans. Our objectives were to (i) identify differences in the pangenomic composition of generalist and host-associated organisms, (ii) characterize genes and functions involved in BE-associated selection, and (iii) identify genomic signatures of ISS-derived strains of potential relevance for astronaut health. The pangenome of B. cereus was more expansive than that of S. aureus, which had a dominant core component. Genomic contents of both taxa significantly correlated with isolate origin, demonstrating an importance for biogeography and potential niche adaptations. ISS/BE-enriched functions were often involved in biosynthesis, catabolism, materials transport, metabolism, and stress response. Multiple origin-enriched functions also overlapped across taxa, suggesting conserved adaptive processes. We further characterized two mobile genetic elements with local neighborhood genes encoding biosynthesis and stress response functions that distinctively associated with B. cereus from the ISS. Although antibiotic resistance genes were present in ISS/BE isolates, they were also common in counterparts elsewhere. Overall, despite differences in microbial lifestyle, some functions appear common to remaining viable in the BE, and those functions are not typically associated with direct impacts on human health. IMPORTANCE The built environment contains a variety of microorganisms, some of which pose critical human health risks (e. g., hospital-acquired infection, antibiotic resistance dissemination). We uncovered a combination of complex biological functions that may play a role in bacterial survival under the presumed selective pressures in a model built environment-the International Space Station-by using an approach to compare pangenomes of bacterial strains from two clinically relevant species (B. cereus and S. aureus) isolated from both built environments and humans. Our findings suggest that the most crucial bacterial functions involved in this potential adaptive response are specific to bacterial lifestyle and do not appear to have direct impacts on human health.","2019","4","10.1128/mSystems.00281-18","me","not yet"

However, it remains unclear about the relative roles of abiotic and biotic properties in controlling the abundance and activity of ammonia-oxidizing and denitrifying microorganisms in permafrost-affected soils.MethodsWe analysed the potential ammonia oxidation and denitrification rates (PAO and PDR), the abundance of archaeal amoA, bacterial amoA, nirK, nirS and nosZ genes, soil characteristics, climatic and plant properties across two vegetation types in Tibetan permafrost-affected soils. The relative importance of abiotic and biotic properties in driving functional N gene abundance, PAO and PDR were assessed using variation partition analysis (VPA) and random forest (RF) model.ResultsThe functional N gene abundance and PDR were lower in alpine steppe than in alpine meadow. Variations in the PAO and PDR and functional N gene abundance were mainly explained by abiotic variables such as organic carbon and total N, then by plant properties such as plant N concentration, plant species richness and productivity based on the VPA. The RF model showed that abiotic properties (e.g., precipitation) and plant properties (e.g., plant N concentration or plant productivity) predicted the PDR and the abundance of functional N genes. Both VPA and RF model showed that the PAO and PDR could be determined by the abundance of functional N genes such as archaeal amoA gene and nosZ gene, respectively.ConclusionsOur study highlights that abiotic and plant properties are important predictors of the abundance and activity of ammonia-oxidizing and denitrifying communities in permafrost-affected regions, implying that plant properties, which were previously overlooked, should be incorporated into ecosystem models for improved prediction of belowground N process rates in a changing environment.","2019","434","10.1007/s11104-018-3845-9","me","not yet"

In this study, the nifH gene was chosen to detect the diazotrophic microorganisms with high-throughput sequencing from five acidic forest soils, including three natural forests and two re-vegetated forests. Soil samples were taken in two seasons (summer and winter) at two depth layers (surface and lower depths). A dataset of 179,600 reads obtained from 20 samples were analyzed to provide the microbial community structure, diversity, abundance, and relationship with physiochemical parameters. Both archaea and bacteria were detected in these samples and diazotrophic bacteria were the dominant members contributing to the biological dinitrogen fixation in the acidic forest soils. Cyanobacteria, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Spirocheates, and Verrucomicrobia were observed, especially the Proteobacteria as the most abundant phylum. The core genera were Bradyrhizobium and Methylobacterium from -Proteobacteia, and Desulfovibrio from -Proteobacteia in the phylum of Proteobacteia of these samples. The diversity indices and the gene abundances of all samples were higher in the surface layer than the lower layer. Diversity was apparently higher in re-vegetated forests than the natural forests. Significant positive correlation to the organic matter and nitrogen-related parameters was observed, but there was no significant seasonal variation on the community structure and diversity in these samples between the summer and winter.

However, the diversity patterns and their environmental determinants across taxonomic scales are still poorly studied. By sampling along an extensive elevational gradient in subarctic ponds of Finland and Norway, we examined the diversity patterns of aquatic bacteria and fungi from whole community to individual taxa across taxonomic coverage and taxonomic resolutions. We further quantified cross-phylum congruence in multiple biodiversity metrics and evaluated the relative importance of climate, catchment and local pond variables as the hierarchical drivers of biodiversity across taxonomic scales. Bacterial community showed significantly decreasing elevational patterns in species richness and evenness, and U-shaped patterns in local contribution to beta diversity (LCBD). Conversely, no significant species richness and evenness patterns were found for fungal community. Elevational patterns in species richness and LCBD, but not in evenness, were congruent across bacterial phyla. When narrowing down the taxonomic scope towards higher resolutions, bacterial diversity showed weaker and more complex elevational patterns. Taxonomic downscaling also indicated a notable change in the relative importance of biodiversity determinants with stronger local environmental filtering, but decreased importance of climatic variables. This suggested that niche conservatism of temperature preference was phylogenetically deeper than that of water chemistry variables. Our results provide novel perspectives for microbial biogeography and highlight the importance of taxonomic scale dependency and hierarchical drivers when modelling biodiversity and species distribution responses to future climatic scenarios.","2019","28","10.1111/mec.14935","me","not yet"

Draft genomes were assembled from cultured isolates and 16S rRNA genes were sequenced from filter samples. 28% of households harbored communities with unambiguous DNA signatures of thermophilic organisms, 36% of households provided viable inocula, and 21% of households had both. All of the recovered cultures as well as the community sequencing results revealed Thermus scotoductus to be the dominant thermophile in domestic water heaters, with a minority of water heaters also containing Meiothermus species and a few containing Aquificae. Sequence distance comparisons show that allopatric speciation does not appear to be a strong control on T. scotoductus distribution.

Amazonian aquatic systems comprise a dynamic mosaic of heterogeneous habits but are understudied and there is limited information about the mechanisms that shape bacterial community composition (BCC). There is a consensus that environmental selection (species sorting) and dispersal processes (source-sink dynamics) act in concert to shape the composition of these communities, but the relative importance of each mechanism may vary dramatically through time and between systems. Applying 16S rRNA gene amplicon high-throughput sequencing, we studied factors and processes that modulate BCC in an Amazonian floodplain lake and used source-tracking models to trace the main dispersal sources of microorganisms in the whole floodplain system during a full hydrological cycle. Our source-tracking models indicated that dispersal processes were predominant, explaining most of the BCC variability throughout the study period. We observed more sources contributing to the sink community during the falling water than rising water period, when contributions from the Solimes River dominated. There was a clear seasonal pattern in BCC, closely related to environmental variables, suggesting that the successful establishment of dispersing bacteria also depends on environmental filtering that is linked to water flow. In summary, source-sink dynamics and species sorting were strongly affected by water exchange and connectivity with the main river that varied throughout the flood pulse cycle. Our results demonstrated the influence of lateral transport and temporal dynamics on BCC in Amazonian floodplain lakes that could ultimately impact regional carbon budgets and biogeochemical cycles.","2019","64","10.1111/fwb.13198","me","not yet"

In total, 45 bacterial phyla and 933 genera were detected from all samples. Cyanobacteria, Proteobacteria and Firmicutes were the most abundant and prevalent phyla, while Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, Acidobacteria and Planctomycetes were grape clone specific phyla. The nonrank genus from phylum Cyanobacteria occupied 30-81% of grape clones from Italian Riesling (GRX), Cabernet Franc (PLZ), Pinot Blanc (BBN) and Riesling (LSL). Interestingly, Bacillus, Pseudomonas and Lactococcus were the only three prevalent genera found on all the clones. Furthermore, the predicted functional activities of grape surface bacterial communities varied according to the clones. Conclusions The present study revealed that in addition to the grape varieties, the variations in grape clone background may also affect the bacterial microbiome on grape surfaces which may ultimately determine their functional activities.

Microbial community composition differed between shoots, roots and soil. While both fungal and bacterial species richness in shoots increased with plant species richness, no correlation was found between plant and microbial diversity in roots and soil. Chemistry was a significant predictor of bacterial and fungal community composition in soil as was also the spatial location of the sampled site. In this species-rich grassland, the effects of plants on the microbiome composition seemed to be restricted to the shoot-associated taxa; in contrast, the microbiomes of roots or soil were not affected.

Geographic location was found to be more important than soil type in determining the microbial community composition: communities from the same site but different soil types, although significantly different from each other, were still much more similar to each other than were communities from the same soil type but from different sites. At a local scale (25-1000m), distance-decay relationships were observed in all soil types: the farther apart two soil communities were located, even in the same soil type, the more they differed. At regional-scale distances (1-260 km), differences between communities did not increase with increased geographic distance between them, and the dominant factor determining the community profile was the physico-chemical environment, most notably annual precipitation (R-2 = 0.69), soil sodium (R-2 = 0.49) and soil ammonium (R-2 = 0.47) levels. We introduce a likelihood-ratio framework for quantitative evaluation of soil microbial DNA profile evidence in casework. In conclusion, these profiles, along with detailed knowledge of natural soil microbial biogeography, provide valuable forensic information on soil sample comparison and allow the determination of approximate source location on large (hundreds of km) spatial scales. Moreover, at small spatial scales it may enable pinpointing the source location of a sample to within at least 25 m, regardless of soil type and environmental conditions.","2019","38","10.1016/j.fsigen.2018.11.010","me","not yet"

The diversity and abundance of soil microbes are influenced by biotic and edaphic factors such as plant communities and soil chemistry. Despite this general understanding, relatively few details are known about how soil microbial community structure responds to changing plant communities and soil chemistry associated with secondary forest succession. To address these gaps, we used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to investigate how diversity, composition and abundance of soil prokaryotic communities differed among five successional stages at two soil depths in a temperate forest, and then related these differences with soil properties. Oligotrophic prokaryotic taxa were more common in earlier successional stages, and community diversity declined at later forest successional stages. Prokaryotic diversity was consistently higher in topsoil than subsoil. Prokaryotic community composition varied with respect to soil organic matter (SOM) properties. The relative abundances of specific carbon (C) functional groups (e.g., aliphatic C groups, aromatic C groups and polysaccharides) revealed by mid-IR spectroscopy were strongly related with prokaryotic community composition. Overall, this study revealed that changes in soil prokaryotic community structure (diversity, composition and taxa abundance) paralleled changes in plant communities and soil chemistry associated with forest succession, and that these changes can be inferred through changes in SOM properties.","2019","128","10.1016/j.soilbio.2018.10.004","me","not yet"

The prominence of Prochlorococcus across the environmental gradients of the open ocean is attributed to its extensive genetic diversity and flexible chlorophyll physiology, enabling light capture over a wide range of intensities. What remains unknown is the balance between temporal dynamics of genetic diversity and chlorophyll physiology in the ability of Prochlorococcus to respond to a variety of short (approximately 1 day) and longer (months to year) changes in the environment. Previous field research established depth-dependent Prochlorococcus single cell chlorophyll distributions in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre. Here, we examined whether the shifts in chlorophyll distributions correspond to changes in Prochlorococcus genetic diversity (i.e., ecotype-level community structure) or photoacclimation of stable communities over short time intervals. We report that community structure was relatively stable despite abrupt shifts in Prochlorococcus chlorophyll physiology, due to unexpected physiological plasticity of high-light adapted Prochlorococcus ecotypes. Through comparison with seasonal-scale changes, our data suggest that variability on daily scales triggers shifts in Prochlorococcus photoacclimation, while seasonal-scale dynamics trigger shifts in community structure. Together, these data highlight the importance of incorporating the process of photoacclimation and chlorophyll dynamics into interpretations of phytoplankton population dynamics from chlorophyll data as well as the importance of daily-scale variability to Prochlorococcus ecology.","2018","5","10.3389/fmars.2018.00488","me","not yet"

The extent of their impact depends essentially on cell-survival rates during the process of aerosolization. A central factor for cell-survival is water availability prior to and upon aerosolization. Also, the ability of cells to successfully cope with stress induced by drying determines their chances of survival. In this study, we used the ice-nucleation active, plant pathogenic Pseudomonas syringae strain R10.79 as a model organism to investigate the effect of drying on cell survival. Two forms of drying were simulated: drying of cells in small droplets aerosolized from a wet environment by bubble bursting and drying of cells in large droplets deposited on a surface. For drying of cells both in aerosol and surface droplets, the relative humidity (RH) was varied in the range between 10 and 90%. The fraction of surviving cells was determined by live/dead staining followed by flow cytometry. We also evaluated the effect of salt concentration in the water droplets on the survival of drying cells by varying the ionic strength between 0 and 700 mM using NaCl and sea salt. For both aerosol and surface drying, cell survival increased with decreasing RH (p < 0.01), and for surface drying, survival was correlated with increasing salt concentration (p < 0.001). Imaging cells with TEM showed shrunk cytoplasm and cell wall damage for a large fraction of aerosolized cells. Ultimately, we observed a 10-fold higher fraction of surviving cells when dried as aerosol compared to when dried on a surface. We conclude that the conditions, under which cells dry, significantly affect their survival and thus their success to spread through the atmosphere and colonize new environments as well as their ability to affect atmospheric processes.","2018","9","10.3389/fmicb.2018.03086","me","not yet"

In addition, knowledge of whether and how historical contingencies affect microbial distributions at small spatial scales is lacking. Here, we analyzed soil-borne microbial (bacterial, archaeal, and fungal) communities in 12 quadrat plots around the Fildes Region of King George Island, maritime Antarctica, and the communities were divided into two groups according to the soil elemental compositions and environmental attributes of Holocene raised beach and Tertiary volcanic stratigraphy. Prokaryotic communities of the two groups were well separated; the prokaryotic data were primarily correlated with soil elemental compositions and were secondly correlated with environmental attributes (e.g., soil pH, total organic carbon, NO3-, and vegetation coverage; Pearson test, r = 0.59 vs. 0.52, both P < 0.01). The relatively high abundance of P, S, Cl, and Br in Group 1 (Holocene raised beach site) was likely due to landform uplift. Lithophile-elements (Si, Al, Ca, Sr, Ti, V, and Fe) correlated with prokaryotic communities in Group 2 may have originated from weathering of Tertiary volcanic rock. No significant correlations were found between the fungal community distribution and both the soil elemental composition and environmental attributes in this study; however, Monte Carlo tests revealed that elements Sr and Ti, soil pH, sampling altitude, and moss and lichen species numbers had significant impacts on fungal communities. The elements and nutrients accumulated during the formation of different landforms influenced the development of soils, plant growth, and microbial communities, and this resulted in small-scale spatially heterogeneous biological distributions. These findings provide new evidence that geological evolutionary processes in the Fildes Region were crucial to its microbial community development, and the results highlight that microbial distribution patterns are the legacies of historical events at this small spatial scale. Based on this study, the ice-free regions in maritime Antarctica represent suitable research sites for studying the influence of geomorphological features on microbial distributions, and we envision the possibility of a site-specific landform assignment through the analysis of the soil prokaryotic community structure.","2018","9","10.3389/fmicb.2018.03065","me","not yet"

In this study, we investigated the spatial distribution and community assembly of fungi in the bulk soil and rhizosphere of soybean collected from 43 sites across China using high-throughput sequencing. The alpha diversity of the rhizosphere was lower than that of bulk soil. The fungal community structures of the two soil compartments were distinct. Fungal communities in the rhizosphere had a steeper distance-decay relationship slope between sampled sites than those in bulk soil, suggesting a greater influence of historical processes ( geographical separation) in the rhizosphere. The relative importance of dispersal limitation and environmental filtering for the fungal community composition differed between bulk soil and rhizosphere. Sloan neutral model analysis suggested that niche-based processes dominated the assemblage of fungal communities in the two soil compartments, while neutral processes had a weaker influence in the rhizosphere than in bulk soil. Additionally, we analyzed the structures of abundant and rare fungal sub-communities in each soil compartment. Rare sub-communities were more strongly influenced by dispersal limitation than abundant sub-communities. These results expand the current understanding of root-associated fungal community biogeography in agricultural soils on a large scale. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Severe perturbations can occur within these microbial communities during critical illness due to underlying diseases and clinical interventions, potentially influencing patient outcomes. We sought to profile the microbial composition of critically ill mechanically ventilated patients, and to determine whether microbial diversity is associated with illness severity and mortality.MethodsWe conducted a prospective, observational study of mechanically ventilated critically ill patients with a high incidence of pneumonia in 2 intensive care units (ICUs) in Hamilton, Canada, nested within a randomized trial for the prevention of healthcare-associated infections. The microbial profiles of specimens from 3 anatomical sites (respiratory, and upper and lower gastrointestinal tracts) were characterized using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing.ResultsWe collected 65 specimens from 34 ICU patients enrolled in the trial (29 endotracheal aspirates, 26 gastric aspirates and 10 stool specimens). Specimens were collected at a median time of 3days (lower respiratory tract and gastric aspirates; interquartile range [IQR] 2-4) and 6days (stool; IQR 4.25-6.75) following ICU admission. We observed a loss of biogeographical distinction between the lower respiratory tract and gastrointestinal tract microbiota during critical illness. Moreover, microbial diversity in the respiratory tract was inversely correlated with APACHE II score (r=-0.46, p=0.013) and was associated with hospital mortality (Median Shannon index: Discharged alive; 1.964 vs. Deceased; 1.348, p=0.045).ConclusionsThe composition of the host-associated microbial communities is severely perturbed during critical illness.

We sought to test the hypothesis that small salt crystals harboring halophilic archaea could be carried on bird feathers and that bird migration is a driving force of these distributions. In this study, we discovered that the American White Pelicans (AWPE) at Great Salt Lake soak in the hypersaline brine and accumulate salt crystals (halite) on their feathers. We cultured halophilic archaea from AWPE feathers and halite crystals. The microorganisms isolated from the lakeshore crystals were restricted to two genera: Halorubrum and Haloarcula, however, archaea from the feathers were strictly Haloarcula. We compared partial DNA sequence of the 16S rRNA gene from our cultivars with that of similar strains in the GenBank database. To understand the biogeography of genetically similar halophilic archaea, we studied the geographical locations of the sampling sites of the closest-matched species. An analysis of the environmental factors of each site pointed to salinity as the most important factor for selection. The geography of the sites was consistent with the location of the sub-tropical jet stream where birds typically migrate, supporting the avian dispersal hypothesis.","2018","10","10.3390/d10040124","me","not yet"

Uncertainty remains, however, in what governs the relative contributions of different ecological processes. To help fill this knowledge gap, we test the general hypothesis that both initial state and degree of change in environmental conditions govern the relative contributions of different ecological assembly processes. To do so, we leveraged regional-scale nutrient and organic matter addition experiments and used soil organic matter (SOM) as a proxy of integrated soil environmental conditions. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that both the initial amount of SOM and the degree of change in SOM-in response to nutrient addition-influenced the relative contributions of different ecological assembly processes. These influences were most clearly observed at the regional scale, suggesting potential scale dependence. More specifically, nutrient additions homogenized bacterial community composition due to enhanced influences of homogenizing dispersal when SOM content was initially high. In contrast, nutrient additions led to divergence in community composition due to variable selection when initial SOM was low and/or when SOM increased significantly in response to nutrient additions. Our findings indicate important connections among initial conditions, degree of change in environmental variables and microbial community assembly processes that may influence ecosystem processes. These conceptual inferences highlight a need to strengthen connections between ecological theory and biogeochemical modelling.","2018","27","10.1111/mec.14914","me","not yet"

So far, the effects of high salinity on the most abundant marine photoautotrophic organism, Prochlorococcus, in marine oligotrophic environments, are mostly unknown. Here, we report the isolation of a new Prochlorococcus strain (RSP50) belonging to high-light (HL) clade II from the Red Sea, one of the warmest and most saline bodies of water in the global oceans. A comparative genomic analysis identified a set of 59 genes that were exclusive to RSP50 relative to currently available Prochlorococcus genomes, the majority of which (70%) encode for hypothetical proteins of unknown function. However, three of the unique genes encode for a complete pathway for the biosynthesis of the compatible solute glucosylglycerol, and are homologous to enzymes found in the sister lineage Synechococcus. Metatranscriptomic analyses of this metabolic pathway in the water column of the Red Sea revealed that the corresponding genes were constitutively transcribed, independent of depth and light, suggesting that osmoregulation using glucosylglycerol is a general feature of HL II Prochlorococcus in the Red Sea.","2018","94","10.1093/femsec/fiy182","me","not yet"

For this reason, it has been proposed as an analogue for Mars, presenting deleterious factors similar to those on the surface of that planet. We evaluated the survival of extremophilic UV-resistant yeasts isolated from a high-elevation area in the Atacama Desert under stratospheric conditions. As biological controls, intrinsically resistant Bacillus subtilis spores were used. Experiments were performed in two independent stratospheric balloon flights and with an environmental simulation chamber. The three following different conditions were evaluated: (i) desiccation, (ii) desiccation plus exposure to stratospheric low pressure and temperature, and (3) desiccation plus exposure to the full stratospheric environment (UV, low pressure, and temperature). Two strains, Naganishia (Cryptococcus) friedmannii 16LV2 and Exophiala sp. strain 15LV1, survived full exposures to the stratosphere in larger numbers than did B. subtilis spores. Holtermanniella watticus (also known as Holtermanniella wattica) 16LV1, however, suffered a substantial loss in viability upon desiccation and did not survive the stratospheric UV exposure. The remarkable resilience of N. friedmannii and Exophiala sp. 15LV1 under the extreme Mars-like conditions of the stratosphere confirms its potential as a eukaryotic model for astrobiology. Additionally, our results with N. friedmannii strengthen the recent hypothesis that yeasts belonging to the Naganishia genus are fit for aerial dispersion, which might account for the observed abundance of this species in high-elevation soils. IMPORTANCE Studies of eukaryotic microorganisms under conditions of astrobiological relevance, as well as the aerial dispersion potential of extremophilic yeasts, are still lacking in the literature compared to works with bacteria. Using stratospheric balloon flights and a simulation chamber, we demonstrate that yeasts isolated from an extreme environment are capable of surviving all stressors found in the stratosphere, including intense UV irradiation, scoring an even higher survival than B. subtilis spores. Notably, the yeast N. friedmannii, which displayed one of the highest tolerances to the stratospheric environment in the experiments, was recently proposed to be adapted to airborne transportation, although such a hypothesis had not yet been tested. Our results strengthen such an assumption and can help explain the observed distribution and ecology of this particular yeast species.","2018","84","10.1128/AEM.01942-18","me","not yet"

Two types of Frankia lineages can be distinguished based on their ability to sporulate in planta. Spore-positive (Sp+) strains are predominant on Alnus incana and Alnus viridis in highlands, while spore-negative (Sp-) strains are mainly associated with Alnus glutinosa in lowlands. Here, we investigated whether the Sp+ predominance in nodules is due to host selection of certain Frankia geno types from soil communities or the result of the ecological history of the alder stand soil, as well as the effect of the sporulation genotype on the ectomycorrhizal (ECM) communities. Trapping experiments were conducted using A. glutinosa, A. incana, and A. viridis plantlets on 6 soils, differing in the alder species and the frequency of Sp+ nodules in the field. Higher diversity of Frankia spp. and variation in Sp+ frequencies were observed in the trapping than in the fields. Both indigenous and trapping species shape Frankia community structure in trapped nodules. Nodulation impediments were observed under several trapping conditions in Sp+ soils, supporting a narrower host range of Sp+ Frankia species. A. incana and A. viridis were able to associate equally with compatible Sp+ and Sp- strains in the greenhouse. Additionally, no host shift was observed for Alnus-specific ECM, and the sporulation genotype of Frankia spp. defined the ECM communities on the host roots. The symbiotic association is likely determined by the host range, the soil history, and the type of in planta Frankia species. These results provide an insight into the biogeographical drivers of alder symbionts in the Holarctic region. IMPORTANCE Most Frankia-actinorhiza plant symbioses are capable of high rates of nitrogen fixation comparable to those found on legumes. Yet, our understanding of the ecology and distribution of Frankia spp. is still very limited. Several studies have focused on the distribution patterns of Frankia spp., demonstrating a combination of host and pedoclimatic parameters in their biogeography. However, very few have considered the in planta sporulation form of the strain, although it is a unique feature among all symbiotic plant-associated microbes. Compared with Sp- Frankia strains, Sp+ strains would be obligate symbionts that are highly dependent on the presence of a compatible host species and with lower efficiency in nitrogen fixation. Understanding the biogeographical drivers of Sp+ Frankia strains might help elucidate the ecological role of in planta sporulation and the extent to which this trait mediates host-partner interactions in the alder-Frankia-ECM fungal symbiosis.","2018","84","10.1128/AEM.01737-18","me","not yet"

Interestingly, no consistent taxonomic or biogeographic predictors have been identified. However, an important lesson learned was that there are interactions among host plants, environmental factors, and characters of the pathogens. A logical extension of the predictivity project is to examine the dynamics of resistances when multiple biotic stresses are involved. In this study, we found that populations susceptible to a foliar feeding pest [Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say)] are resistant to a bacterial pathogen [Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum (Jones, 1901; Hauben et al. 1999)]. We propose that wounds caused by the insect pest allow the bacterial pathogen to gain entry and cause disease. This would lead to strong selection pressure for resistance to the bacterial pathogen. Consequently, when searching for traits of interest in germplasm collections, it is important to consider the complex biotic and abiotic environments in which the source populations evolved.","2018","65","10.1007/s10722-018-0682-x","me","not yet"

Here, we examined latitudinal variation in the soil biota community associated with the invasive plant Alternanthera philoxeroides and its native congener A. sessilis, and the effects of soil biota community variation on these plants and the beetle Agasicles hygrophila. We characterized the soil bacterial and fungal communities and root-knot nematodes of plant rhizospheres collected from 22 degrees N to 36.6 degrees N in China. Soil biota community structure changed with latitude as a function of climate and soil properties. Root-knot nematode abundance and potential soil fungal pathogen diversity (classified with FUNGuild) decreased with latitude, apparently due to higher soil pH and lower temperatures. A greenhouse experiment and lab bioassay showed native plant mass, seed production, and mass of beetles fed native foliage increased with soil collection latitude. However, there were no latitudinal patterns for the invasive plant. These results suggest that invasive and native plants and, consequently, their herbivores have different responses to latitudinal changes in soil-borne enemies, potentially creating spatial variation in enemy release or biotic resistance. This highlights the importance of linking above- and below-ground multitrophic interactions to explore the role of soil biota in non-native plant invasions with a biogeographic approach.","2018","12","10.1038/s41396-018-0219-5","me","not yet"

The biogeography of rhizobia has been well investigated, but little is known about the spatial distribution and community assemblage of NRE. By using high-throughput sequencing, we compared biogeographic patterns of rhizobial and non-rhizobial subcommunities and investigated their bacterial co-occurrence patterns in nodules collected from 50 soybean fields across China. Dispersal probability was lower in NRE than in rhizobia, as revealed by a significant distance-decay relationship found in NRE, but not in rhizobia, in addition to a significant occupancy-abundance relationship in the entire community. Rhizobial and NRE subcommunities were significantly influenced by different environmental and spatial variables. Moreover, the rhizobial subcommunities were grouped into Ensifer- and Bradyrhizobium-dominated clusters that were significantly related to soil pH. The non-rhizobial subcommunities were grouped into Proteobacteria-and Firmicutes-dominated clusters that were more influenced by climatic than by edaphic factors. These results demonstrated that rhizobial and non-rhizobial subcommunities are characterized by distinct biogeographic patterns. Network analysis showed rhizobia and NRE as separately grouped and uncorrelated with each other, suggesting they did not share niche space in soybean nodules.

The objective of this study was to test whether water flow can accelerate microbial pesticide degradation by facilitating the encounter of spatially separated pesticides and bacterial degraders at the millimeter scale. Combining natural and sterilized soil aggregates, we built soil cores with different spatial localizations of the pesticide 2,4-dichIorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and microbial degraders: (i) homogeneous distribution of microorganisms and 2,4-D throughout the soil core, (ii) co-localized microorganisms and 2,4-D in a mm(3) soil location, and iii) separated microorganisms and 2,4-D in two mm(3) soil locations spaced 1 cm apart. Following the fate of C-14 labelled 2,4-D (mineralization, extractable and non-extractable residues) as well as the abundance of bacterial 2,4-D degraders harboring the tfdA gene over an incubation period of 24 days, we observed decreased biodegradation of 2,4-D with increasing spatial separation between substrate and bacterial degraders. We found evidence that advection is a key process controlling the accessibility of 2,4-D and pesticide degraders. Advective solute transport induced leaching of about 50% of the initially applied 2,4-D regardless of initial spatial distribution patterns. Simultaneously, advective transport of 2,4-D and bacterial degraders triggered their re-encounter and compensated for the leaching-induced separation of initially co-localized micro-organisms and 2,4-D. This resulted in effective biodegradation of 2,4-D, comparable to the homogeneous treatment. Similarly, advective transport processes brought substrate and degraders into contact if both were initially separated. Thus, advection more effectively removed bioaccessibility limitations to pesticide degradation than diffusive transport alone. These results emphasize the importance of considering spatial microbial ecology as well as biogeophysics at the mm scale to better understand the fate of pesticides at larger scales in soil.","2018","127","10.1016/j.soilbio.2018.09.024","me","not yet"

However, little is known about the environmental factors explaining this for soil methane-oxidising bacteria (or methanotrophs), which play an essential role in ecosystem functioning and climate regulation through mitigation of net CH4 emissions worldwide. This knowledge gap limits the inclusion of taxon-based information to improve predictions of climate change-simulation models. In this study, 697 soil samples were collected across Scotland and 62 climo-edaphic properties were analysed. Combined with a set of hybrid geostatistical modelling approaches, the aim of this study was to investigate the biogeographical distribution (pmoA gene relative abundance) of key methanotrophic operational taxonomic units named Terminal-Restriction Fragments (T-RFs) and of methanotrophic community structure. The main objectives were to: 1) identify major environmental drivers influencing the distribution and composition of methanotrophs; and 2) perform spatial modelling and mapping of soil methanotrophic community assemblage and distribution of those dominant T-RFs. Herein, it was hypothesised that the assemblage of methanotrophic community and distribution of key populations across various landscapes could be predicted using a range of climo-edaphic factors optimised for spatial, climate and terrain attributes. The findings presented here suggest that the distribution of methanotrophs is strongly linked to land use and some edaphic properties, predominantly soil moisture/rainfall, nutrients and metal ions. The hybrid geostatistical approach allowed for spatial prediction of methanotrophic T-RFs and community, and demonstrated a clear niche partitioning between dominant T-RFs. Overall, these results provide novel evidence that the distribution of methanotrophs could be explained and mapped in terms of niche partitioning and predicted at the regional scale. The findings of the present study have significance for the sustainable management of ecosystems and improvement of simulation models for better prediction of ecosystem functions under predicted global changes.","2018","127","10.1016/j.soilbio.2018.08.014","me","not yet"

Near surface interactions between urban waterways and urban air are understudied but some level of interaction among these bacterial communities would be expected and may be relevant to understanding both urban air and water quality. To address this gap related to patterns of local air-water microbial exchange, we utilized next-generation sequencing of 16S rRNA genes from paired air and water samples collected from 3 urban waterfront sites and evaluated their relative bacterial diversity. Aerosol samples at all sites were significantly more diverse than water samples. Only 17-22% of each sites bacterial aerosol OTUs were present at every site. These shared aerosol OTUs included taxa associated with terrestrial systems (e.g., Bacillus), aquatic systems (e.g., Planktomarina) and sewage (e.g., Enterococcus). In fact, sewage-associated genera were detected in both aerosol and water samples, (e.g., Bifidobacterium, Blautia, and Faecalibacterium), demonstrating the widespread influence of similar pollution sources across these urban environments. However, the majority (50-61%) of the aerosol OTUs at each site were unique to that site, suggesting that local sources are an important influence on bioaerosols. According to indicator species analysis, each sites aerosols harbored the highest percentage of bacterial OTUs statistically determined to uniquely represent that sites aquatic bacterial community, further demonstrating a local connection between water quality and air quality in the urban environment.","2018","9","10.3389/fmicb.2018.02868","me","not yet"

Here, we suggest the use of microbial mats as a model of study to reveal patterns that can illuminate the ecological processes underlying microbial dynamics in response to stress. We traced the responses to anthropogenic perturbation caused by water depletion in microbial mats from Cuatro Cienegas Basin (CCB), Mexico, by using a time-series spatially resolved analysis in a novel combination of three computational approaches. First, we implemented MEBS (Multi-genomic Entropy-Based Score) to evaluate the dynamics of major biogeochemical cycles across spatio-temporal scales with a single informative value. Second, we used robust Time Series-Ecological Networks (TS-ENs) to evaluate the total percentage of interactions at different taxonomic levels. Lastly, we utilized network motifs to characterize specific interaction patterns. Our results indicate that microbial mats from CCB contain an enormous taxonomic diversity with at least 100 phyla, mainly represented by members of the rare biosphere (RB). Statistical ecological analyses point out a clear involvement of anaerobic guilds related to sulfur and methane cycles during wet versus dry conditions, where we find an increase in fungi, photosynthetic, and halotolerant taxa. TS-ENs indicate that in wet conditions, there was an equilibrium between cooperation and competition (positive and negative relationships, respectively), while under dry conditions there is an over-representation of negative relationships. Furthermore, most of the keystone taxa of the TS-ENs at family level are members of the RB and the microbial mat core highlighting their crucial role within the community. Our results indicate that microbial mats are more robust to perturbation due to redundant functions that are likely shared among community members in the highly connected TS-ENs with density values close to one (approximate to 0.9). Finally, we provide evidence that suggests that a large taxonomic diversity where all community members interact with each other (low modularity), the presence of permanent of low-abundant taxa, and an increase in competition can be potential buffers against environmental disturbance in microbial mats.","2018","9","10.3389/fmicb.2018.02606","me","not yet"

"Li, J; Shen, XZ","An improved neutral community model for temporal observations in microbial communities","ECOLOGICAL MODELLING","Niche theory and neutral theory propose two alternative mechanisms for explaining the long-term coexistence of species in ecological communities. However, the true dynamic mechanisms of ecological communities likely fall in between these two theories of niches and neutrality. Thus, models reconciling the niche and neutral theories to interpret these mechanisms are of high significance. Using temporal observations of microbial communities, Ofiteru et al. (2010) demonstrated a version of the neutral community model that quantifies the contributions of neutral forces and environmental factors on the population dynamics of species in the community. They use a novel weighted least squares method to estimate the parameters. However, this method estimates compound parameters and the population size cannot be disentangled from the immigration rate, becoming computationally intractable when there are zero values existing in the temporal observations. In the current study, we suggest a new version of the neutral community model, modified from the work of Oficeru et al. that does not suffer from these limitations. We also provide a new method for estimating the parameters for our model, which can resolve the estimates of individual parameters.

However, it is not yet clear whether bacterial communities can rebound to their pre-disturbance levels. To shed light on this issue, we tracked the responses of bacterial communities during an extreme salinization-desalinization cycle.ResultsOur results showed that salinization-up process induced an ecological succession, shifting from a community dominated by Betaproteobacteria to Gammaproteobacteria. Within the desalinization-down process, taxon-specific recovery trajectories varied profoundly, with only Gammaproteobacteria returning to their initial levels, of which Alphaproteobacteria was the most prominent member. The -diversity indices gradually increased at oligosaline environment (0.03 to 3 parts per thousand) and subsequently decreased profoundly at hypersaline condition (10 parts per thousand to 90 parts per thousand). However, the indices did not return to pre-disturbance level along the previous trajectory observed during the desalinization. Approximately half of the original OTUs were not detected during desalinization, suggesting that the seed bank may be damaged by the hypersaline environment.

These holes are self-contained ecosystems that include abundant bacterial life within their sediment and liquid water, and have recently gained the attention of microbial ecologists looking to use cryoconite holes as natural microcosms to study microbial community assembly. Here, we explore the idea that cryoconite holes can be viewed as islands, in the same sense that an island in the ocean is an area of habitat surrounded by a barrier to entry. In the case of a classic oceanic island, the ocean is a barrier between islands, but in the case of cryoconite holes, the ocean is comprised of impermeable solid ice. We test two hypotheses, born out of island biogeographic theory, that can be readily applied to cryoconite hole bacteria. First, we ask to what extent the size of a cryoconite hole is related to the amount of bacterial diversity found within it. Second, we ask to what extent cryoconite holes exhibit distance decay of similarity, meaning that geographically close holes are expected to harbor similar bacterial communities, and distant holes are expected to harbor more different bacterial communities. To test the island size hypothesis, we measured the sizes of cryoconite holes on three glaciers in Antarcticas Taylor Valley and used DNA sequencing to measure diversity of bacterial communities within them. We found that for two of these glaciers, there is a strong relationship between hole size and bacterial phylogenetic diversity, supporting the idea that cryoconite holes on those glaciers are islands. The high biomass dispersing to the third glacier we measured could explain the lack of size-diversity relationship, remaining consistent with island biogeography. To test the distance decay of similarity hypothesis, we used DNA sequence data from several previous studies of cryoconite hole bacteria from across the world. Combined with our Taylor Valley data, those data showed that cryoconite holes have strong spatial structuring at scales of one to several hundred kilometers, also supporting the idea that these dirty holes on glaciers are really islands in the cryosphere.","2018","6","10.3389/fevo.2018.00180","me","not yet"

We show that this endangered oasis can be a model for a lost world. The ancient niche of extreme unbalanced nutrient stoichiometry favoured survival of ancestral microorganisms. This extreme nutrient imbalance persisted due to environmental stability and low extinction rates, generating a diverse and unique bacterial community. Several endemic clades of Bacillus invaded the Cuatro Cienegas region in two geological times, the late Precambrian and the Jurassic.

Stream ecosystems are under high anthropogenic pressure; however, studies have only examined the response of stream communities across large scales over multiple generations. We studied the responses of leaf-associated microbial communities in streams within three European biogeographical regions to chemical stress in a microcosm experiment with multiple cycles of fungicide pollution and resource colonisation. Fungal community composition and the ecosystem function leaf decomposition were measured as response variables. Microbial leaf decomposition showed similar recovery times under environmental levels of fungicide exposure across regions. Initially, the decomposition declined (between 19 and 53%) under fungicide stress and recovered to control levels during the third cycle of pollution and colonisation. Although community composition and its stress response varied between regions, this suggests similar functional community adaptation towards fungicide stress overtime. Genetic, epigenetic and physiological adaptations, as well as species turnover, may have contributed to community adaptation but further studies are required to determine if and to which extent these mechanisms are operating. Overall, our findings provide the first evidence of a similar functional response of microbial leaf decomposition to chemical stress across space and time.","2018","8","10.1038/s41598-018-35397-1","me","not yet"

Previous studies have reported that hydroxyapatite has been extensively used to immobilize soil heavy metals, and the grain sizes of amendments affect the bioavailability and geochemical stability of heavy metals. However, it is not clear how soil microbial diversity and community composition in these soils vary with the application of hydroxyapatite. A field study was conducted to determine the effect of different grain sizes of hydroxyapatite on Cu and Cd bioavailability and microbial community composition. Results showed that micro-hydroxyapatite (MAP), nanohydroxyapatite (NAP) and normal hydroxyapatite (AP) increased soil pH and decreased soil exchangeable acid and exchangeable Al. Compared with the control, MAP was the most efficient in decreasing the CaCl2-extractable Cu and Cd by 97.5 and 86.5%, respectively, and exchangeable Cu and Cd by 82.4% and 27.4%, respectively. The soil microbial community composition varied with the amendments of different sizes, and the soil bacterial diversity increased after the amendment applications. Analysis of the network structure showed that fewer operational taxonomic units were enriched or depleted between the MAP- and NAP-amended soils, which explained the similarity between the MAP- and NAP-amended soils. These results suggest that MAP may be the best material for amending heavy metal-contaminated soils when considering immobilization efficiency and soil biological characteristics.","2018","267","10.1016/j.agee.2018.08.017","me","not yet"

Here, we describe the late winter plankton (5-200 mu m) structure in terms of abundance, biomass, species composition, functional groups, and phycotoxin profiles in surface waters of El Rincon in September 2015. Diatoms are the most abundant and the largest contributors to carbon biomass at most stations. They dominated the coastal and inner-shelf (depths <50 m), while dinoflagellates and small flagellates (<15 mu m) dominated offshore at the middle-shelf waters (depth similar to 100 m). In addition, large (> 20 mu m) heterotrophic protists such as various ciliates and dinoflagellates species were more abundant offshore. Scanning of phycotoxins disclosed that paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) toxins were dominated by gonyautoxins-1/4 (GTX1/4), whereas lipophilic toxins were detected in low abundance, for example, domoic acid (DA). However, a bloom of Pseudo-nitzschia spp. (up to 3.6 x 10(5) cells L-1) was detected at inner-shelf stations. Pectenotoxin-2 (PTX-2) and 13-desmethyl spirolide C (SPX-1) were the most abundant in the field.

Pathogens have to exquisitely monitor the biogeography of the gastrointestinal tract to find a suitable niche for colonization. To dissect the important metabolic pathways that influence virulence of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC), we conducted a highthroughput screen. We generated a dataset of regulatory pathways that control EHEC virulence expression under anaerobic conditions. This unraveled that the cysteine-responsive regulator, CutR, converges with the YhaO serine import pump and the fatty acid metabolism regulator FadR to optimally control virulence expression in EHEC. CutR activates expression of YhaO to increase activity of the YhaJ transcription factor that has been previously shown to directly activate the EHEC virulence genes. CutR enhances FadL, which is a pump for fatty acids that represses inhibition of virulence expression by FadR, unmasking a feedback mechanism responsive to metabolite fluctuations. Moreover, CutR and FadR also augment murine infection by Citrobacter rodentium, which is a murine pathogen extensively employed as a surrogate animal model for EHEC. This high-throughput approach proved to be a powerful tool tomap the web of cellular circuits that allows an enteric pathogen to monitor the gut environment and adjust the levels of expression of its virulence repertoire toward successful infection of the host.","2018","115","10.1073/pnas.1813451115","me","not yet"

We compared the phylogenetic diversity of marine and freshwater microorganisms and identified specific lineages exhibiting notably high or low similarity between marine and freshwater ecosystems using a meta-analysis of 16S rRNA gene tag-sequencing data sets. As expected, marine and freshwater microbial communities differed in the relative abundance of major phyla and contained habitat-specific lineages. At the same time, and contrary to expectations, many shared taxa were observed in both habitats. Based on several metrics, we found that Gammaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Betaproteobacteria contained the highest number of closely related marine and freshwater sequences, suggesting comparatively recent habitat transitions in these groups. Using the abundant alphaproteobacterial group SAR11 as an example, we found evidence that new lineages, beyond the recognized LD12 Glade, are detected in freshwater at low but reproducible abundances; this evidence extends beyond the 16S rRNA locus to core genes throughout the genome. Our results suggest that shared taxa are numerous, but tend to occur sporadically and at low relative abundance in one habitat type, leading to an underestimation of transition frequency between marine and freshwater habitats. Rare taxa with abundances near or below detection, including lineages that appear to have crossed the salty divide relatively recently, may possess adaptations enabling them to exploit opportunities for niche expansion when environments are disturbed or conditions change. IMPORTANCE The distribution of microbial diversity across environments yields insight into processes that create and maintain this diversity as well as potential to infer how communities will respond to future environmental changes. We integrated data sets from dozens of freshwater lake and marine samples to compare diversity across open water habitats differing in salinity. Our novel combination of sequence-based approaches revealed lineages that likely experienced a recent transition across habitat types. These taxa are promising targets for studying physiological constraints on salinity tolerance. Our findings contribute to understanding the ecological and evolutionary controls on microbial distributions, and open up new questions regarding the plasticity and adaptability of particular lineages.","2018","3","10.1128/mSystems.00232-18","me","not yet"

We sought to determine the taxonomic bacterial biogeography of the upper GI tract, including different sites within the human stomach (cardia, corpus, and antrum), adjacent upstream (esophagus) and downstream (duodenum) locations, and luminal contents (aspirate), as well as whole-stomach samples from mice and gerbils. Qualitative and quantitative DNA- and RNA-based taxonomic microbiota analyses were combined to study the relationship of relative and absolute bacterial abundances and transcriptionally active bacterial microbiota components in the stomach of humans and mice. Stomach microbiota compositions resembled those of esophagus and duodenum. However, along the descending GI tract, the relative abundances of specific oropharyngeal commensals decreased (Streptococcus) or increased (Rothia mucilaginosa, Porphyromonas, and Lachnospiraceae). Furthermore, the compositional similarity (weighted UniFrac) between stomach aspirates and esophageal biopsy samples increased with gastric Streptococcus relative abundance. In both human aspirate and mouse stomach samples, Firmicutes were more abundant among transcriptionally active bacteria than Bacteroidetes. The relative abundance of Firmicutes in the stomach was negatively correlated and that of Bacteroidetes was positively correlated with absolute bacterial abundance, suggesting a disproportionate increase of Bacteroidetes over Firmicutes at higher bacterial densities. Human, mouse, and gerbil stomach samples showed similarities at higher taxonomic levels but differences at lower taxonomic levels. Our findings suggest selective enrichment and depletion of specific bacterial taxa in the stomach and Firmicutes being transcriptionally more active than Bacteroidetes that increase in relative abundance with total bacterial load. IMPORTANCE Clinical stomach interventions, such as acid inhibition or bypass surgery, have been linked to fecal microbiota alterations. We demonstrate that the stomach microbiota largely overlaps those of adjacent gastrointestinal locations and identify gradual decreases and increases in the relative abundances of specific bacteria within the stomach, suggesting selective enrichment and depletion. Moreover, similarities between stomach and esophagus samples are proportional to the concentrations of Streptococcus (Firmicutes) in the stomach. The relative abundance of Firmicutes in the stomach, compared to that of Bacteroidetes, is increased in RNA relative to DNA, indicating higher transcriptional activity. Moreover, increased absolute bacterial loads are associated with decreased relative abundance of Firmicutes and higher relative abundance of Bacteroidetes. Our findings characterize the stomach microbiota as influenced by Bacteroidetes influx against a background of transcriptionally more active Firmicutes. Human, mouse, and gerbil stomach microbiotas differ at lower taxonomic levels, which might affect the utility of these model organisms.","2018","3","10.1128/mSystems.00262-18","me","not yet"

In addition, distant locations may also lead to biogeographical patterns of microbial communities. Here, we used an undisturbed salt marsh chronosequence spanning over a century of ecosystem development to investigate changes in the community composition and abundance of a set of nitrogen-cycling genes. Specifically, we targeted genes of diazotrophs and ammonia oxidizers associated with the bulk and rhizosphere soil of the plant species Limonium vulgare. Samples were collected across five distinct successional stages of the chronosequence (ranging from 5 to 105years) at two time-points. Our results indicate that soil variables such as sand:silt:clay % content and pH strongly relates to the abundance of N-cycling genes in the bulk soil. However, in the rhizosphere samples, the abundance of ammonia-oxidizing organisms (both bacteria and archaea, AOB and AOA, respectively) was relatively constant across most of the successional stages, albeit displaying seasonal variation. This result indicates a potentially stronger control of plant host (rather than soil) on the abundance of these organisms. Interestingly, the plant host did not have a significant effect on the composition of AOA and AOB communities, being mostly divergent according to soil successional stages. The abundance of diazotrophic communities in rhizosphere samples was more affected by seasonality than those of bulk soil. Moreover, the abundance pattern of diazotrophs in the rhizosphere related to the systematic increase of plant biomass and soil organic matter along the successional gradient. These results suggest a potential season-dependent regulation of diazotrophs exerted by the plant host. Overall, this study contributes to a better understanding of how the natural formation of a soil and host plants influence the compositional and abundance changes of nitrogen-cycling genes in bulk and rhizosphere soil microhabitats.","2018","111","10.1007/s10482-018-1098-5","me","not yet"

While highly diverse fungi have been discovered in these marine systems, still, little is known about their seasonality and associated drivers in coastal waters. Here, we examined fungal communities over 3 years of weekly sampling at a dynamic, temperate coastal site (Pivers Island Coastal Observatory [PICO], Beaufort, NC, USA). Fungal 18S rRNA gene abundance, operational taxonomic unit (OTU) richness, and Shannons diversity index values exhibited prominent seasonality. Fungal 18S rRNA gene copies peaked in abundance during the summer and fall, with positive correlations with chlorophyll a, SiO4, and oxygen saturation. Diversity (measured using internal transcribed spacer [ITS] libraries) was highest during winter and lowest during summer; it was linked to temperature, pH, chlorophyll a, insolation, salinity, and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). Fungal communities derived from ITS libraries were dominated throughout the year by Ascomycota, with contributions from Basidiomycota, Chytridiomycota, and Mucoromycotina, and their seasonal patterns linked to water temperature, light, and the carbonate system. Network analysis revealed that while cooccurrence and exclusion existed within fungus networks, exclusion dominated the fungus-and-phytoplankton network, in contrast with reported pathogenic and nutritional interactions between marine phytoplankton and fungi. Compared with the seasonality of bacterial communities in the same samples, the timing, extent, and associated environmental variables for fungi community are unique. These results highlight the fungal seasonal dynamics in coastal water and improve our understanding of the ecology of planktonic fungi. IMPORTANCE Coastal fungal dynamics were long assumed to be due to terrestrial inputs; here, a high-resolution time series reveals strong, repeating annual patterns linked to in situ environmental conditions, arguing for a resident coastal fungal community shaped by environmental factors. These seasonal patterns do, however, differ from those observed in the bacterioplankton at the same site; e.g., fungal diversity peaks in winter, whereas bacterial diversity maxima occur in the spring and fall. While the dynamics of these communities are linked to water temperature and insolation, fungi are also influenced by the carbonate system (pH and DIC). As both fungi and heterotrophic bacteria are thought to be key organic-material metabolizers, differences in their environmental drivers may offer clues as to which group dominates secondary production at this dynamic site. Overall, this study suggests the unique ecological roles of mycoplankton and their potentially broad niche complementarities to other microbial groups in the coastal ocean.","2018","84","10.1128/AEM.00967-18","me","not yet"

In some instances, fermented foods provide a rich source of the beneficial microbial communities that could promote gastrointestinal health. The indigenous microbiota that colonize fermentation facilities may impact food quality, food safety, and spoilage risks and maintain the nutritive value of the product. Here, microbiomes within sauerkraut production facilities were profiled to characterize variance across surfaces and to determine the sources of these bacteria. Accordingly, we used high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene in combination with whole-genome shotgun analyses to explore biogeographical patterns of microbial diversity and assembly within the production facility. Our results indicate that raw cabbage and vegetable handling surfaces exhibit more similar microbiomes relative to the fermentation room, processing area, and dry storage surfaces. We identified biomarker bacterial phyla and families that are likely to originate from the raw cabbage and vegetable handling surfaces. Raw cabbage was identified as the main source of bacteria to seed the facility, with human handling contributing a minor source of inoculation. Leuconostoc and Lactobacillaceoe dominated all surfaces where spontaneous fermentation occurs, as these taxa are associated with the process. Wall, floor, ceiling, and barrel surfaces host unique microbial signatures. This study demonstrates that diverse bacterial communities are widely distributed within the production facility and that these communities assemble nonrandomly, depending on the surface type. IMPORTANCE Fermented vegetables play a major role in global food systems and are widely consumed by various global cultures. In this study, we investigated an industrial facility that produces spontaneous fermented sauerkraut without the aid of starter cultures. This provides a unique system to explore and track the origins of an in-house microbiome in an industrial environment. Raw vegetables and the surfaces on which they are handled were identified as the likely source of bacterial communities rather than human contamination. As fermented vegetables increase in popularity on a global scale, understanding their production environment may help maintain quality and safety goals.","2018","84","10.1128/AEM.01680-18","me","not yet"

This problem is reduced to determining whether two soil samples test and control have the same origin or source. Here, we propose an algorithm which copes with this problem based on 16S rRNA gene libraries of test and control soil samples and does not rely on OTU clustering. The algorithm first extracts the Library-SPECific sets of sequences (LSPECs) for alternative control libraries and then quantifies signals of LSPECs in a test library. The heavy use of the suffix array approach for sequence comparison accelerates the algorithm significantly. To evaluate the performance of the algorithm, we collected a control set of 29 soil samples and created two test sets (real and simulated), containing mixed, contaminated and extremely small single-source soil samples (last samples resemble forensics probes). We then carried out 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing of total soil DNA isolated from both test and control soil samples. The algorithm successfully identified the origin of all single source soil samples and the compositions of mixed and even low/highly contaminated samples. The algorithm also demonstrated robustness to the increase in control set size from 9 to 29. We believe the proposed algorithm is suitable for identification problems with various degrees of complexity and is flexible enough to manage other molecular markers and microbiological samples from different non-soil sources.","2018","94","10.1016/j.ecolind.2018.06.060","me","not yet"

Surprisingly, coordinated patterns in plant, bacterial, and fungal diversity on tropical mountains have not yet been observed, despite the central role of soil microorganisms in terrestrial biogeochemistry and ecology. We studied an Andean transect traversing 3.5 km in elevation to test whether the species diversity and composition of tropical forest plants, soil bacteria, and fungi follow similar biogeographical patterns with shared environmental drivers. We found coordinated changes with elevation in all three groups: species richness declined as elevation increased, and the compositional dissimilarity among communities increased with increased separation in elevation, although changes in plant diversity were larger than in bacteria and fungi. Temperature was the dominant driver of these diversity gradients, with weak influences of edaphic properties, including soil pH. The gradients in microbial diversity were strongly correlated with the activities of enzymes involved in organic matter cycling, and were accompanied by a transition in microbial traits towards slower-growing, oligotrophic taxa at higher elevations. We provide the first evidence of coordinated temperature-driven patterns in the diversity and distribution of three major biotic groups in tropical ecosystems: soil bacteria, fungi, and plants. These findings suggest that interrelated and fundamental patterns of plant and microbial communities with shared environmental drivers occur across landscape scales. These patterns are revealed where soil pH is relatively constant, and have implications for tropical forest communities under future climate change.","2018","99","10.1002/ecy.2482","me","not yet"

Smoke from global biomass burning has had significant and widespread ecological and human health consequences, but the living component of smoke has received little attention. Microbes aerosolized and transported by wildland fire may have profound effects on atmospheric and environmental factors, acting as nuclei for ice condensation, transporting pathogens or symbionts, and otherwise influencing ecosystems and human populations downwind. The potential for smoke to aerosolize and transport viable microbes is a virtually blank piece of the microbial biogeography puzzle with far-reaching implications. This study characterized the aerosolization of viable microbes via wildland fire smoke from burns in contrasting coniferous forests. Seventy aerosolized microbial morphotypes were recovered, and of these, a subset was identified using DNA analysis which revealed both pathogenic and non-pathogenic fungal species. Overall microbial colony-forming units decreased with increasing distance from smoke source, driven by bacterial abundance. Organisms were more abundant in smoke derived from mechanically treated fuels than intact forest floors and were most abundant in smoke from a dry, biennially burned Pinus palustris sandhill forest in Florida. Our findings of smoke-transported viable microbes have implications for ecosystem restoration/conservation, global biodiversity, meteorology, and human health.","2018","9","10.1002/ecs2.2507","me","not yet"

This premise remains challenging to test, however, as it requires quantifying the traits of closely related soil bacteria and relating these traits to bacterial abundances and geographic distributions. Here, we sought to investigate whether the widespread soil taxon Curtobacterium consists of multiple coexisting ecotypes with differential geographic distributions. We isolated Curtobacterium strains from six sites along a climate gradient and assayed four functional traits that may contribute to niche partitioning in leaf litter, the top layer of soil. Our results revealed that cultured isolates separated into fine-scale genetic clusters that reflected distinct suites of phenotypic traits, denoting the existence of multiple ecotypes. We then quantified the distribution of Curtobacterium by analysing metagenomic data collected across the gradient over 18 months. Six abundant ecotypes were observed with differential abundances along the gradient, suggesting fine-scale niche partitioning. However, we could not clearly explain observed geographic distributions of ecotypes by relating their traits to environmental variables. Thus, while we can resolve soil bacterial ecotypes, the traits delineating their distinct niches in the environment remain unclear.","2018","20","10.1111/1462-2920.14405","me","not yet"

The prokaryotic communities are considered as one of the best indicators of the water quality. However, there are significant gaps in understanding the ecological processes that shape the composition and function of prokaryotic communities in the urban water ecosystems. Here, we investigated the biogeographic distribution of prokaryotic assemblages in water environments including landscape ponds, drinking water reservoirs, influents (IFs) and effluents (EFs) of wastewater treatment plants of a coastal city (Xiamen), China, by using 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing. Our results indicated that the ponds had higher alpha-diversity of prokaryotic communities than those in the reservoirs, while there were significant variations in the community compositions among ponds, reservoirs, IFs and EFs. Moreover, ponds harbored a significantly higher proportion of sewage- and fecal-indicator taxa than those in the reservoirs, suggesting the occurrence of exogenous pollution in the urban ponds. Null model analysis revealed that dispersal limitation was the main ecological processes resulting in the divergence of prokaryotic community compositions between ponds and other environments, while dispersal limitation and variable selection played an essential role in the formation of unique prokaryotic assemblages in the reservoirs. Function predication analysis demonstrated that the ponds shared more similar functional profiles with IFs or EFs (e.g., chemoheterotrophy, fermentation, chlorate reducers, nitrate reduction and respiration) than the reservoirs, whereas dominance of photoautotrophy was observed in the reservoirs. Overall, this study provides a profound insight of the ecological mechanisms underlying the responses of prokaryotic communities in the urban landscape ponds to the anthropogenic disturbances.

Therefore, hypersaline systems have attracted much attention in recent years. In this study, we investigated the protistan diversity and community composition in two natural salt evaporation ponds (27-30% salinity) located in an ancient volcanic crater on the Cape Verde island Sal using high-throughput DNA sequencing. Our study revealed a broad range of protistan taxa and a high taxonomic diversity within the Ciliophora, Dinophyceae, and Chlorophyta. We detected a total of 23 Dinophyceae families, although Dinophyceae were generally considered to be only this diverse in aquatic environments of less than 10% salinity. Moreover, we uncovered a high degree of genetic novelty in this habitat. The mean similarity of all detected OTUs to previously described sequences was only 93.6%. These findings strongly dispute the traditional view that extreme hypersaline environments generally maintain low protistan diversity. A meta-analysis covering our and previously published data from other inland and coastal salt ponds clearly showed that our samples clustered according to salinity and not biogeography. This result further supports the claim that salinity is a major transition boundary for protistan communities, regardless of their biogeographic origin.","2018","22","10.1007/s00792-018-1050-7","me","not yet"

While originally constrained by a lack of appropriate analytical tools and sequencing depth, new technologies and computational and statistical algorithms have been developed to handle highly dimensional, next-generation sequencing datasets. Both these tools allow for the robust analysis of structural and distributional patterns of microbiota essential for the understanding of microbial ecology and biogeography. Furthermore, consortia of individual laboratories working on large interdisciplinary research programs, like the Human and Earth Microbiome Projects, have developed standardized protocols for DNA extraction, sequencing pipelines, and bioinformatics. These approaches provide large repositories of publicly available data to serve as references for on-going and future, hypothesis-driven studies to better characterize the roles of microbial communities in diverse ecosystems. In this review, we outline the currently available statistical approaches and tools to aid in statistically powered study designs and analyses. Given what is now known about the enormous diversity and variability of the microbial communities in aquatic and terrestrial habitats, we also discuss practical considerations for sample collection. Due to the extensive advances made in the field of metagenomics over the last decade, rigorous, well replicated, hypothesis-driven studies are: 1) needed, 2) now possible, and 3) essential to make best use of sequencing-based technologies to characterize the roles of microbial communities in the structure and function of diverse ecosystems.","2018","154","10.1016/j.mimet.2018.09.020","me","not yet"

Most marine species are believed to have a relatively high dispersal potential, such that both globally distributed and geographically isolated taxa exist. Primary occurrence data for three large, easily identified ciliate species, Parafavella gigantea, Schmidingerella serrata, and Zoothamnium pelagicum, and environmental data drawn from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations World Ocean Atlas were used to estimate each species spatial and environmental distributions using Maxent v3.3.3k. The predictive power of the models was tested with a series of spatial stratification studies, which were evaluated using partial receiver operating characteristic (ROC) statistics. Differences between niches occupied by each taxon were evaluated using background similarity tests. All predictions showed significant ability to anticipate test points. The null hypotheses of niche similarity were rejected in all background similarity tests comparing the niches among the three species. This article provides the first quantitative assessment of environmental conditions associated with three species of ciliates and a first estimate of their spatial distributions in the North Atlantic, which can serve as a benchmark against which to document distributional shifts. These species follow consistent, predictable patterns related to climate and environmental biochemistry; the importance of climatic conditions as regards protist distributions is noteworthy considering the effects of global climate change.","2018","63","10.1002/lno.11003","me","not yet"

However, many large rivers worldwide are suffering from dam regulation. Increasing attention has been paid to bacterioplankton communities since they are highly responsive to river alterations and may influence biogeochemical processes. Here, a comprehensive study was conducted in the highly regulated Lancang-Mekong River Basin to address the question of how bacterioplankton communities respond to cascade damming. The results showed that dam constructions increased nutrient concentrations and threatened water quality in cascade reservoirs. Bacterioplankton cell abundance was reduced by damming, and alpha-diversity was inhibited in cascade reservoirs. Fortunately, however, river ecosystems were resilient after the remarkable disturbance caused by damming. Moreover, bacterioplankton community composition was significantly altered by cascade dams, including a shift in the dominant phylum from r-strategists to k-strategists. Meanwhile, according to GeoChip analysis, the functional composition of bacterioplankton was less affected than taxonomic composition. In addition, geographic and environmental features both followed a distance-decay relationship with community and functional composition, but the local environment condition was the dominant driver in the Lancang River. Therefore, the impoundments of cascade dams had significant impacts on bacterioplankton communities and more attention should be paid to the potential ecological consequences of river regulation.","2018","27","10.1111/mec.14870","me","not yet"
"Leventhal, GE; Boix, C; Kuechler, U; Enke, TN; Sliwerska, E; Holliger, C; Cordero, OX","Strain-level diversity drives alternative community types in millimetre-scale granular biofilms","NATURE MICROBIOLOGY","Microbial communities are often highly diverse in their composition, both at a coarse-grained taxonomic level, such as genus, and at a highly resolved level, such as strains, within species. This variability can be driven by either extrinsic factors such as temperature and or by intrinsic ones, for example demographic fluctuations or ecological interactions. The relative contributions of these factors and the taxonomic level at which they influence community composition remain poorly understood, in part because of the difficulty in identifying true community replicates assembled under the same environmental parameters. Here, we address this problem using an activated granular sludge reactor in which millimetre-scale biofilm granules represent true community replicates. Differences in composition are then expected to be driven primarily by biotic factors. Using 142 shotgun metagenomes of single biofilm granules we found that, at the commonly used genus-level resolution, community replicates varied much more in their composition than would be expected from neutral assembly processes. This variation did not translate into any clear partitioning into discrete community types, that is, distinct compositional states, such as enterotypes in the human gut. However, a strong partition into community types did emerge at the strain level for the dominant organism: genotypes of Candidatus Accumulibacter that coexisted in the metacommunity (the reactor) excluded each other within community replicates (granules). Individual granule communities maintained a significant lineage structure, whereby the strain phylogeny of Accumulibacter correlated with the overall composition of the community, indicating a high potential for co-diversification among species and communities. Our results suggest that due to the high functional redundancy and competition between close relatives, alternative community types are most probably observed at the level of recently differentiated genotypes but not at higher orders of genetic resolution.","2018","3","10.1038/s41564-018-0242-3","me","not yet"

It can differentially influence mitochondrial bioenergetics, retrograde signalling to the nuclear genome, and anterograde signalling to mitochondria. All these interactions have the potential to alter the frequencies of mtDNA haplotypes (mitotypes) in nature and may impact human health. In a model laboratory system, we fed four diets varying in Protein: Carbohydrate (P:C) ratio (1:2, 1:4, 1:8 and 1:16 P:C) to four homoplasmic Drosophila melanogaster mitotypes (nuclear genome standardised) and assayed their frequency in population cages. When fed a high protein 1:2 P:C diet, the frequency of flies harbouring Alstonville mtDNA increased. In contrast, when fed the high carbohydrate 1:16 P:C food the incidence of flies harbouring Dahomey mtDNA increased. This result, driven by differences in larval development, was generalisable to the replacement of the laboratory diet with fruits having high and low P:C ratios, perturbation of the nuclear genome and changes to the microbiome. Structural modelling and cellular assays suggested a V161L mutation in the ND4 subunit of complex I of Dahomey mtDNA was mildly deleterious, reduced mitochondrial functions, increased oxidative stress and resulted in an increase in larval development time on the 1:2 P:C diet. The 1:16 P:C diet triggered a cascade of changes in both mitotypes. In Dahomey larvae, increased feeding fuelled increased beta-oxidation and the partial bypass of the complex I mutation. Conversely, Alstonville larvae upregulated genes involved with oxidative phosphorylation, increased glycogen metabolism and they were more physically active. We hypothesise that the increased physical activity diverted energy from growth and cell division and thereby slowed development. These data further question the use of mtDNA as an assumed neutral marker in evolutionary and population genetic studies. Moreover, if humans respond similarly, we posit that individuals with specific mtDNA variations may differentially metabolise carbohydrates, which has implications for a variety of diseases including cardiovascular disease, obesity, and perhaps Parkinsons Disease.","2018","14","10.1371/journal.pgen.1007735","me","not yet"

However, the effect of slope aspect on arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, a group of functionally important root-associated microorganisms, remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated AM fungal communities in an alpine ecosystem on a northwest-facing slope (NS) and a southeast-facing slope (SS) along a steep environmental gradient. Ecological processes structuring the fungal communities were inferred according to phylogenetic patterns and species abundance distributions. Thirty-two distinct AM fungal virtual taxa (VTs) were identified, predominantly belonging to the genus Glomus. The change of slope aspect from SS to NS recorded a significant decline in AM fungal richness, resulting in a marked loss of Glomus VTs and the dominance of Rhizophagus. Moreover, both taxonomic and phylogenetic composition of AM fungal communities significantly varied between the two slope aspects, this being largely driven by niche partitioning based on microclimate, soil pH and plant species composition. The influence of geographical distance was negligible. AM fungal communities were phylogenetically clustered on SS and random on NS, suggesting that the central process structuring communities shifted from a niche-dominated filter to the combination of competitive exclusion and a niche filter. Similarly, AM fungal species abundance distribution showed the best fit with the Lognormal model on SS and the Zipf-Mandelbrot model on NS, indicating that community dynamics on both slopes were also in accordance with niche-based mechanisms.","2018","126","10.1016/j.soilbio.2018.08.016","me","not yet"

We assessed the BC composition of a littoral and two pelagic habitats (euphotic zone and hypolimnion) of Lake Tovel monthly from April 2014 to May 2017 by high-throughput sequencing of the V3-V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene. The three habitats differed in temperature, light, oxygen and hydrology. In particular, the littoral was the most hydrologically unstable because it receives most of the lake inflow, the hypolimnion was the most stable because of its hydrologically sheltered position, and the pelagic euphotic habitat was intermediate. Consequently, we hypothesized different temporal patterns of BC composition for all three habitats according to their environmental differences. We applied PERMANOVA, nonmetric multidimensional scaling and source-sink analysis to characterize BC composition. Overall, BCs were different among habitats with the littoral showing the highest variability and the hypolimnion the highest stability. The BC of rainy 2014 was distinct from the BCs of other years irrespective of the habitats considered. Seasonal differences in BCs were limited to spring, probably linked to meltwater inflow and mixing. Thus, temporal effects related to year and season were linked to the hydrological gradient of habitats. We suggest that despite potential within-lake dispersal of bacterioplankton by water flow and mixing, local environmental conditions played a major role in Lake Tovel, fostering distinct BCs in the three habitats.","2018","27","10.1111/mec.14855","me","not yet"

Here we show that Lactobacillus reuteri coexists with species that belong to the Lactobacillus johnsonii cluster (L. johnsonii, L. gasseri, and L taiwanensis) in a taxonomically wide range of rodents, suggesting cohabitation over evolutionary times. The two dominant Lactobacillus species found in wild mice establish a commensalistic relationship in gastric biofilms when introduced together into germ-free mice in which L. reuteri facilitates colonization of L. taiwanensis. Genomic analysis revealed allopatric diversification in strains of both species that originated from geographically separated locations (Scotland and France). Allopatry of the strains resulted in reduced formation of mixed biofilms in vitro, indicating that interspecies interactions in gastric Lactobacillus-biofilms are the result of an adaptive evolutionary process that occurred in a biogeographical context. In summary, these findings suggest that members within the vertebrate gut microbiota can evolve inter-dependencies through ecological facilitation, which could represent one mechanism by which host-specific bacterial communities assemble across vertebrate species and an explanation for their spatial and biogeographic patterns.","2018","12","10.1038/s41396-018-0211-0","me","not yet"

Several recent studies have shown predictable seasonal reoccurrence of bacterial assemblages. However, only a few have assessed temporal variability over both horizontal and vertical spatial scales. Here, we simultaneously studied the bacterial community structure at two different locations and depths in shelf waters of a coastal upwelling system during an annual cycle. The most noticeable biogeographic patterns observed were seasonality, horizontal homogeneity, and spatial synchrony in bacterial diversity and community structure related with regional upwelling-downwelling dynamics. Water column mixing eventually disrupted bacterial community structure vertical heterogeneity. Our results are consistent with previous temporal studies of marine bacterioplankton in other temperate regions and also suggest a marked influence of regional factors on the bacterial communities inhabiting this coastal upwelling system. Bacterial-mediated carbon fluxes in this productive region appear to be mainly controlled by community structure dynamics in surface waters, and local environmental factors at the base of the euphotic zone.","2018","76","10.1007/s00248-018-1179-z","me","not yet"

Terrestrial hot springs typically contain thermophilic bacterial communities, but the diversity and impacts of its associated viruses (thermophilic phages) are largely unexplored. Here, we provide a taxonomic overview of phages that have been isolated strictly from terrestrial hot springs around the world. In addition, we placed 17 thermophilic phage genomes in a global phylogenomic context to detect evolutionary patterns. Thermophilic phages have diverse morphologies (e.g., tailed, filamentous), unique virion structures (e.g., extremely long tailed siphoviruses), and span five taxonomic families encompassing strictly thermophilic phage genera. Within the phage proteomic tree, six thermophilic phage-related clades were identified, with evident genomic relatedness between thermophilic phages and archaeal viruses. Moreover, whole proteome analyses showed clustering between phages that infect distinct host phyla, such as Firmicutes and Deinococcus-Thermus. The potential for discovery of novel phage-host systems in terrestrial hot springs remain mostly untapped, thus additional emphasis on thermophilic phages in ecological prospecting is encouraged to gain insights into the microbial population dynamics of these environments.","2018","22","10.1007/s00792-018-1052-5","me","not yet"

Therefore, they should show little population genetic structure due to high gene flow. Nevertheless, substantial genetic structure has been reported among populations of many taxa. In rotifers, genetic studies have focused on planktonic taxa leaving sessile groups largely unexplored. Here, we used COI gene and ITS region sequences to study genetic structure and delimit cryptic species in two sessile species (Limnias melicerta [32 populations]; L. ceratophylli [21 populations]). Among populations, ITS region sequences were less variable as compared to those of the COI gene (ITS; L. melicerta: 0-3.1% and L. ceratophylli: 0-4.4%; COI; L. melicerta: 0-22.7% and L. ceratophylli: 0-21.7%). Moreover, L. melicerta and L. ceratophylli were not resolved in phylogenetic analyses based on ITS sequences. Thus, we used COI sequences for species delimitation. Bayesian Species Delimitation detected nine putative cryptic species within L. melicerta and four putative cryptic species for L. ceratophylli. The genetic distance in the COI gene was 0-15.4% within cryptic species of L. melicerta and 0.5-0.6% within cryptic species of L. ceratophylli. Among cryptic species, COI genetic distance ranged 8.1-21.9% for L. melicerta and 15.1-21.2% for L. ceratophylli. The correlation between geographic and genetic distance was weak or lacking; thus geographic isolation cannot be considered a strong driver of genetic variation. In addition, geometric morphometric analyses of trophi did not show significant variation among cryptic species. In this study we used a conservative approach for species delimitation, yet we were able to show that species diversity in these sessile rotifers is underestimated.","2018","13","10.1371/journal.pone.0205203","me","not yet"
"Li, W; Yuan, YL; Xia, Y; Sun, Y; Miao, YL; Ma, S","A Cross-Scale Neutral Theory Approach to the Influence of Obesity on Community Assembly of Human Gut Microbiome","FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY","Background: The implications of gut microbiome to obesity have been extensively investigated in recent years although the exact mechanism is still unclear. The question whether or not obesity influences gut microbiome assembly has not been addressed. The question is significant because it is fundamental for investigating the diversity maintenance and stability of gut microbiome, and the latter should hold a key for understanding the etiological implications of gut microbiome to obesity. Methods: In this study, we adopt a dual neutral theory modeling strategy to address this question from both species and community perspectives, with both discrete and continuous neutral theory models. The first neutral theory model we apply is Hubbells neutral theory of biodiversity that has been extensively tested in macro-ecology of plants and animals, and the second we apply is Sloans neutral theory model that was developed particularly for microbial communities based on metagenomic sequencing data. Both the neutral models are complementary to each other and integrated together offering a comprehensive approach to more accurately revealing the possible influence of obesity on gut microbiome assembly. This is not only because the focus of both neutral theory models is different (community vs. species), but also because they adopted two different modeling strategies (discrete vs. continuous). Results: We test both the neutral theory models with datasets from Turnbaugh et al. (2009). Our tests showed that the species abundance distributions of more than 1/2 species (59-69%) in gut microbiome satisfied the prediction of Sloans neutral theory, although at the community level, the number of communities satisfied the Hubbells neutral theory was negligible (2 out of 278). Conclusion: The apparently contradictory findings above suggest that both stochastic neutral effects and deterministic environmental (host) factors play important roles in shaping the assembly and diversity of gut microbiome. Furthermore, obesity may just be one of the host factors, but its influence may not be strong enough to tip the balance between stochastic and deterministic forces that shape the community assembly. Finally, the apparent contradiction from both the neutral theories should not be surprising given that there are still near 30-40% species that do not obey the neutral law.","2018","9","10.3389/fmicb.2018.02320","me","not yet"

While bacterioplankton communities in the Baltic Sea are strongly structured by salinity, how MBIs impact the composition and distribution of bacteria is unknown. The exceptional MBI in 2014, which brought saline and oxygenated water into the basins of the central Baltic Sea, enabled the linkage of microbiological investigations to hydrographic and modeling studies of this MBI. Using sequence data of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and 16S rRNA genes (rDNA), we analyzed bacterioplankton community composition in the inflowing water and in the uplifted former bottom water at stations reached by the MBI. Bacterial diversity data were compared with respective data obtained from previous, non-inflow conditions. Changes in bacterial community composition following the 2014 MBI were mainly apparent at the genus level. A number of specific taxa were enriched in the inflowing water, with large changes in the rRNA/rDNA ratios indicating the different activity levels between of the water masses. The relative similarity of the bacterial communities in the inflowing and uplifted waters as well as the results from an inflow-simulating numerical model showed that the inflowing water did not originate directly from the North Sea but mostly from adjacent areas in the Baltic Sea. This suggested that the inflow event led to a series of shifts in Baltic Sea water masses among the Baltic Sea basins and a gradual mixing of the water bodies. Dramatic changes in the bacterial community composition occurred when the bottom-water inflow reached the anoxic, sulfidic deep basins, resulting in an uplifting of the formerly anoxic bacterial community, dominated by Epsilonproteobacteria. Our study of the impact of MBIs on bacterioplankton communities therefore highlights two relevant underlying mechanisms that impact the distribution and possibly also the activities of planktonic bacteria in the Baltic Sea: (1) the successive dilution of inflowing North Sea water with ambient waters and (2) the uplifting of former bottom-water communities to higher water strata.","2018","5","10.3389/fmars.2018.00383","me","not yet"

In order to unmask the bacterial diversity and most influential environmental parameters, Illumina MiSeq high throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA from 24 representative soil samples collected across south-east to north-west transect of the Loess Plateau in northern Shaanxi, China was conducted. This high-throughput sequencing revealed a total of 1,411,001 high quality sequences that classified into 38 phyla, 127 classes, >240 orders, and over 650 genera, suggesting a high bacterial richness across the Loess Plateau soils. The seven dominant groups were: Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, Planctomycetes, Gemmatimonadetes, Chloroflexi, and Verrucomicrobi (relative abundance of >5%). Increasing/ decreasing soil pH and geographic longitudinal distance correlated significantly with increasing/decreasing bacterial richness and diversity indices. Pairwise correlation analysis showed higher bacterial diversity at longitudinal gradients across 107 degrees 39-109 degrees 15 (south-east to north-west) in our studied Chinese loess zone. Variation partitioning analysis indicated significant influence of soil characteristics (similar to 40.4%) than geographical distance (at a landscape scale of similar to 400 km) that was responsible for 13.6% of variation in bacterial community structure from these soils.

However, the diazotrophs in grassland soils are still far from fully investigated. Particularly, their regional-scale distribution patterns have never been systematically examined. Here, soils (0-5 cm) were sampled from 54 grasslands on the Tibetan Plateau to examine the diazotroph abundance, diversity, and community composition, as well as their distribution patterns and driving factors. The diazotroph abundance was expressed as nifH gene copies, measured using real-time PCR. The diversity and community composition of diazotrophs were analyzed through MiSeq sequencing of nifH genes. The results showed that Cyanobacteria (47.94%) and Proteobacteria (45.20%) dominated the soil diazotroph communities. Most Cyanobacteria were classified as Nostocales which are main components of biological crusts. Rhizobiales, most of which were identified as potential symbiotic diazotrophs, were also abundant in approximately half of the soil samples. The soil diazotroph abundance, diversity, and community composition followed the distribution patterns in line with mean annual precipitation. Moreover, they also showed significant correlations with prokaryotic abundance, plant biomass, vegetation cover, soil pH values, and soil nutrient contents. Among these environmental factors, the soil moisture, organic carbon, available phosphorus, and inorganic nitrogen contents could be the main drivers of diazotroph distribution due to their strong correlations with diazotroph indices. These findings suggest that autotrophic and symbiotic diazotrophs are the predominant nitrogen fixers in Tibetan grassland soils, and highlight the key roles of water and nutrient availability in determining the soil diazotroph distribution on the Tibetan Plateau.

Typhimurium monophasic variant 4,[5],12:i:- has been associated with food-borne epidemics worldwide and swine appeared to be the main reservoir in most of the countries of isolation. However, the monomorphic nature of this serovar has, so far, hindered identification of the source due to expansion of clonal lineages in multiple hosts and food producing systems. Since geographically structured genetic signals can shape bacterial populations, identification of biogeographical markers in S. 1,4,[5],12:i:- genomes can contribute to improving source attribution. In this study, the phylogeographical structure of 148 geographically and temporally related Italian S. 1,4,[5],12:i:- has been investigated. The Italian isolates belong to a large population of clonal S. Typhimurium/1,4,[5],12:i:- isolates collected worldwide in two decades showing up to 2.5% of allele differences. Phylogenetic reconstruction revealed that isolates from the same geographical origin form highly supported monophyletic groups, suggesting discrete geographical segregation. These monophyletic groups are characterized by the gene content of a large sopE-containing prophage. Within this prophage, genome-wide comparison identified several genes overrepresented in strains of Italian origin. This suggests that certain lineages may be characterized by the acquisition of specific accessory genetic markers useful for improving identification of the source in ongoing epidemics.","2018","8","10.1038/s41598-018-33266-5","me","not yet"

Consequently, their traits drive community processes with profound effects on global biogeochemistry. Species traits are, however, not necessarily static but respond to environmental changes in order to maintain fitness and may differ with cell size that scales physiological rates. Comprehending such trait characteristics is necessary for a mechanistic understanding of plankton community dynamics and resulting biogeochemical impacts. Here, we used information theory to analyze metatranscriptomes of micro- and nano-dinoflagellate communities in three ecosystems. Measures of gene expression variations were set as a proxy to determine conserved and plastic community traits and the environmental influence on trait changes. Using metabarcoding, we further investigated if communities with a more similar taxon composition also express more similar traits. Our results indicate that plastic community traits mainly arise from membrane vesicle associated processes in all the environments we investigated. A specific environmental influence on trait plasticity was observed to arise from nitrogen availability in both size classes. Species interactions also appeared to be responsible for trait plasticity in the smaller-sized dinoflagellates. Additionally, the smaller-sized dinoflagellate communities are characterized by the expression of a large pool of habitat specific genes despite being taxonomically more similar across the habitats, in contrast to the microplanktonic assemblages that adapted to their environments by changing species composition. Our data highlight the functional diversification on the gene level as a signature of smaller sized dinoflagellates, nitrogen availability and species interactions as drivers of trait plasticity, and traits most likely linked to fitness and community performance.","2018","5","10.3389/fmars.2018.00358","me","not yet"

Although aquatic fungal communities respond to pollution, few studies have quantitatively assessed the effect of freshwater contamination on fungal diversity and composition; and knowledge is scarcer for tropical systems. Here we help fill this knowledge gap by studying a heavily-contaminated South American river spanning a biodiversity hotspot. We collected 30 water samples scattered across a quality gradient over two seasons and analyzed them using Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphisms (T-RFLP) coupled with 454 Pyrosequencing. Using T-RFLP we identified 451 and 442 Operational Taxonomy Units (OTUs) in the dry and rainy seasons respectively, whereas Pyrosequencing revealed 48,553 OTUs from which 11% were shared between seasons. Although 68% of all identified OTUs and 51% of all identified phyla remained unidentified, dominant fungal phyla included the Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Chytridiomycota, Glomeromycota, Zygomycota and Neocallimastigomycota, while Calcarisporiella, Didymosphaeria, Mycosphaerella (Ascomycota) and Rhodotorula (Basidiomycota) were the most abundant genera. Fungal diversity was affected by pH and dissolved iron, while community composition was influenced by dissolved oxygen, pH, nitrate, biological oxygen demand, total aluminum, total organic carbon, total iron and seasonality. The presence of potentially pathogenic species was associated with high pH. Furthermore, geographic distance was positively associated with community dissimilarity, suggesting that local conditions allowed divergence among fungal communities.

"Ma, ZS","DAR (diversity-area relationship): Extending classic SAR (species-area relationship) for biodiversity and biogeography analyses","ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION","I extend the classic SAR, which has achieved status of ecological law and plays a critical role in global biodiversity and biogeography analyses, to general DAR (diversity-area relationship). The extension was aimed to remedy a serious application limitation of the traditional SAR that only addressed one aspect of biodiversity scaling-species richness scaling over space, but ignoring species abundance information. The extension was further inspired by a recent consensus that Hill numbers offer the most appropriate measures for alpha-diversity and multiplicative beta-diversity. In particular, Hill numbers are essentially a series of Renyis entropy values weighted differently along the rare-common-dominant spectrum of species abundance distribution and are in the units of effective number of species (or species equivalents such as OTUs). I therefore postulate that Hill numbers should follow the same or similar law of the traditional SAR. I test the postulation with the American gut microbiome project (AGP) dataset of 1,473 healthy North American individuals. I further propose three new concepts and develop their statistical estimation formulae based on the new DAR extension, including: (i) DAR profile-z-q relationship (DAR scaling parameter z at different diversity order q), (ii) PDO (pair-wise diversity overlap) profile-g-q relationship (PDO parameter g at order q, and (iii) MAD (maximal accrual diversity: D-max) profile-D-max-q.

In this study, we characterize spatial and temporal trends in microbial community composition throughout a stream network spanning first through fifth order streams. We found that the microbial communities of headwater streams are compositionally diverse, with low representation of freshwater microbial taxa and high representation of soil and sediment-associated taxa. In three out of five seasonal samplings, a successional pattern was identified in which phylotype richness and compositional heterogeneity decreased while the proportion of known freshwater taxa increased with increasing cumulative upstream dendritic distance. However, in two samplings, streams instead exhibited uniformly high microbial diversity across the watershed, and the fraction of freshwater taxa showed no relationship with dendritic distance. Overall, our data suggest that the successional processes that drive microbial diversity in streams are highly dynamic and can be disrupted at landscape scales, potentially in response to variation in temperature and precipitation.","2018","20","10.1111/1462-2920.14311","me","not yet"

Selection at 16 and 31 degrees C for 350 generations led to significant divergence in several temperature response traits, demonstrating local adaptation and the existence of trade-offs associated with adaptation to different temperatures. In contrast, competitive ability for nitrogen (commonly limiting in marine systems), measured after 450 generations of temperature selection, did not diverge in a systematic way between temperatures.

We collected 72 environmental samples in 12 geothermal sites, measured temperature and pH, and performed rbcL amplicon-based 454 pyrosequencing. Using these data, we estimated the diversity of microalgal species, and then examined the relative contribution of contemporary selection (i.e., local environmental variables) and dispersal limitation on the assembly of these communities. A species delimitation analysis uncovered seven major microalgae (fourred, two green, and one diatom) and higher species diversity than previously appreciated. A distance-based redundancy analysis with variation partitioning revealed that dispersal limitation has a greater influence on the community assembly of microalgae than contemporary selection. Consistent with this finding, community similarity among the sampled sites decayed more quickly over geographical distance than differences in environmental factors.

Myoviridae was the dominant phage family in the North Sea, which occurrence decreased from the coast to the open sea.

We hypothesized that abiotic and/or biotic interactions are probably more important for explaining the distribution patterns of marine bacterioplankton than environmental filtering. In this study, surface seawater samples were collected about 7000 miles from the Mediterranean Sea, transecting the North Atlantic Ocean, to the Brazilian marginal sea. In bacterial biosphere, SAR11, SAR86, Rhodobacteraceae, and Rhodospiriaceae were predominant in the Mediterranean Sea; Prochlorococcus was more frequent in Atlantic Ocean: whereas in the Brazilian coastal sea, the main bacterial members were Synechococcus and SAR11. With respect to archaea, Eloyarchaeota were predominant in the Atlantic Ocean and Thaumarchaeota in the Mediterranean Sea. With respect to the eukaryotes, Syndiniales, Spumellaria, Ciyomonadida, and Chlorodendrales were predominant in the open ocean, while diatoms and microzooplankton were dominant in the coastal sea. Distinct clusters of prokaryotes and eukaryotes displayed clear spatial heterogeneity. Among the environmental parameters measured, temperature and salinity were key factors controlling bacterial and archaeal community structure, respectively, whereas N/P/Si contributed to eukaryotic variation. The relative contribution of environmental parameters to the microbial distribution pattern was 45.2%. Interaction analysis showed that Gammaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, and 1.7avobacteriia were the keystone taxa within the positive-correlation network, while Thermoplasmata was the main contributor in the negativecorrelation network. Our study demonstrated that microbial communities are co-governed by environmental filtering and biotic interactions, which are the main deterministic driving factors modulating the spatiotemporal patterns of marine plankton synergistically at the regional or global levels.","2018","76","10.1007/s00248-018-1150-z","me","not yet"

However, the origination and development of antibiotics has yet to be explicitly investigated. Due to diverse structures and similar biosynthesis, glycosylated polyene macrolides (gPEMs) were chosen to explore antibiotic evolution. A total of 130 candidate and 38 transitional gPEM clusters were collected from actinomycetes genomes, providing abundant references for phenotypic gaps in gPEM evolution. The most conserved parts of gPEM biosynthesis were found and used for phylogeny construction. On this basis, we proposed ancestral gPEM clusters at different evolutionary stages and interpreted the possible evolutionary histories in detail. The results revealed that gPEMs evolved from small rings to large rings and continuously increased structural diversity through acquiring, discarding and exchanging genes from different evolutionary origins, as well as co-evolution of functionally related proteins. The combination of horizontal gene transfers, environmental effects and host preference resulted in the diversity and worldwide distribution of gPEMs. This study is not only a useful exploration on antibiotic evolution but also an inspiration for diversity and biogeographic investigations on antibiotics in the era of Big Data.","2018","127","10.1016/j.ympev.2018.06.005","me","not yet"

In this paper, we utilize a biogeography database summarizing data on AMF species distribution linked to geographic and environmental conditions to describe global distribution patterns and interpret these patterns within a phylogenetic perspective. The data were obtained from accessions in living culture collections (INVAM, CICG), species descriptions, and other published literature from 1960 to 2012. The database contains 7105 records, 6396 of them from 768 published papers and the remaining 709 from culture accessions. Glomeromycotan species were recorded in all seven continents, 87 countries, 11 biogeographical realms, and 14 biomes. The distribution of families differed among climatic zones and continents, but they. together with all genera, appear to be cosmopolitan. Distribution of AMF species shows a slight decrease from low to high latitudes, but this decrease is steeper in the southern than in the northern hemisphere. A total of 189 species is shared between ancient supercontinents Gondwana and Laurasia and 78 species are common to all climatic zones. Ninety five species (43% of the total) have known cosmopolitan distribution, including members of all genera except Redeckera. Some species have disjunct distribution and 26% of species have been registered from only one continent. Data on AMF distribution challenge the Everything is everywhere hypothesis in favor of the moderate endemicity model for species distribution. Data from this study provide a foundation to formulate and test hypotheses of biogeographic patterns and processes in Glomeromycota.","2018","28","10.1007/s00572-018-0864-6","me","not yet"
"Li, SJ; Luo, ZX; Ji, GD","Seasonal function succession and biogeographic zonation of assimilatory and dissimilatory nitrate-reducing bacterioplankton","SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT","The dominance of different nitrate-reducing pathways determines nitrogen cycling patterns. Denitrification (DNF) has been widely studied, but assimilatory nitrate reduction (ANR) and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) have received much less attention. Their ecological patterns and responsible microbes are poorly understood. Here, we studied the structure and function succession of the three functional groups in the middle route of the South-to-NorthWater Diversion Project, which is a 1230 km canal spanning 8 degrees of latitude. The results reflected a nitrogen-removing pattern dominated by DNF in the summer and a nitrogen-retaining pattern dominated by ANR and DNRA in the winter. Stenotrophomonas, a typical denitrifier, was the keystone species in the summer and contributed to N2O production. Clostridium, a genus able to conduct ANR and DNRA, was the keystone species in the winter. Notably, a significant zonation pattern was discovered. According to the community structure, the system could be separated into two biogeographic zones, and the Yellow River (about latitude 35 degrees N) is an important cut-off line. This bacterial biogeography followed differentwater characteristics and ecological processes. ANR was found to be an important process and seasonally transformed its habitat from the northern zone to the southern zone. DNRA bacteria were acclimated to the northern zone and favored at this region in both seasons. The generation of N2O, a strong greenhouse gas, also exhibited this zonation pattern. This is the first study to consider assimilatory and dissimilatory nitrate reducers together at a molecular level, and provides new insights into the underlying patterns of a nitrate-reducing bacterioplankton community.

"Azovsky, AI","Robustness of relative diversity metrics to inventory incompleteness: Could we estimate the near imponderable?","GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY","Aim Relative diversity metrics (RDMs), such as local : global or regional : global diversity ratios and percentage of endemics, are widely applied in biodiversity studies. This approach, however, is flawed because the real global diversity of many taxa is still largely unknown, especially for rare species. This potential inconsistency of RDMs has not been proved (or disproved) thus far. Here, I use simulation models to explore the efficiency of RDM estimations from incomplete inventories. Location Methods World-wide. Three simple models of species distribution were used: (a) the everything is everywhere model (unlimited dispersal, i.e., equal probability for a species to occur at every point); (b) the environmental selection model (each species can occupy only a portion of randomly distributed suitable localities according to its ecological preferences); and (c) the endemicity model (most species are restricted to a few regions each). To parameterize these models, the world-wide datasets on ciliates, flagellates and harpacticoid copepods were used. The RDMs were estimated by simulating equal-effort sampling and by varying the full number of species and number of sampled individuals per cell. Results Main conclusions Estimated species richness at any scale was heavily influenced by the sampling effort and was greatly underestimated with small sample sizes. The estimated RDM values also depended on the sampling effort (being either upward or downward biased) but were only slightly influenced by the unrecorded part of real global diversity (ignorance). The predictions of the first two models were generally close to each other but differed noticeably from those of the third model. The relative metrics, albeit influenced by undersampling, are nevertheless more robust to inventory incompleteness than absolute measures and can therefore be a reliable tool in comparative biodiversity studies, even if the true number of species cannot be estimated overall. Their estimated values, however, must be interpreted with caution.","2018","27","10.1111/geb.12777","me","not yet"

In Central America, the main vector is Triatoma dimidiata, an opportunistic blood meal feeder inhabiting both domestic and sylvatic ecotopes. Given the diversity of interacting biological agents involved in the epidemiology of Chagas disease, having simultaneous information on the dynamics of the parasite, vector, the gut micro biome of the vector, and the blood meal source would facilitate identifying key biotic factors associated with the risk of T. cruzi transmission. In this study, we developed a RADseq-based analysis pipeline to study mixed-species DNA extracted from T. dimidiata abdomens. To evaluate the efficacy of the method across spatial scales, we used a nested spatial sampling design that spanned from individual villages within Guatemala to major biogeographic regions of Central America. Information from each biotic source was distinguished with bioinformatics tools and used to evaluate the prevalence of T. cruzi infection and predominant Discrete Typing Units (DTUs) in the region, the population genetic structure of T. dimidiata, gut microbial diversity, and the blood meal history. An average of 3.25 million reads per specimen were obtained, with approximately 1% assigned to the parasite, 20% to the vector, 11% to bacteria, and 4% to putative blood meals. Using a total of 6,405 T. cruzi SNPs, we detected nine infected vectors harboring two distinct DTUs: Tcl and a second unidentified strain, possibly TcIV. Vector specimens were sufficiently variable for population genomic analyses, with a total of 25,710 T. dimidiata SNPs across all samples that were sufficient to detect geographic genetic structure at both local and regional scales. We observed a diverse microbiotic community, with significantly higher bacterial species richness in infected T. dimidiata abdomens than those that were not infected. Unifrac analysis suggests a common assemblage of bacteria associated with infection, which co-occurs with the typical gut microbial community derived from the local environment. We identified vertebrate blood meals from five T. dimidiata abdomens, including chicken, dog, duck and human; however, additional detection methods would be necessary to confidently identify blood meal sources from most specimens. Overall, our study shows this method is effective for simultaneously generating genetic data on vectors and their associated parasites, along with ecological information on feeding patterns and microbial interactions that may be followed up with complementary approaches such as PCR-based parasite detection, 18S eukaryotic and 16S bacterial barcoding.","2018","12","10.1371/journal.pntd.0006730","me","not yet"

Physical and chemical parameters were measured in order to explain what might control the observed patterns in community composition and diversity. In response to environmental changes between seasons, especially the dramatic changes of temperature and nutrient (NO2-N and PO4-P) levels, Synechococcus and unclassified genera in Family I predominated in summer while some oligotrophic taxa (e.g., Pelagibacter, OM43 Glade) are more abundant in winter. The spatial heterogeneity and overall patchiness of bacterial assemblages in the Bohai Strait could not be well explained by the measured factors. However, the taxa with the most spatially variable presence and absence, e.g. Vibrionaceae, SAR11 and Sva0996 marine group, possess differentiated niches for utilization of organic matter (OM) and display a close relationship with the distribution of OM sources in this area, which may indicate the significance of OM sources to bacterial community structure.

We measured routine metabolism in two hydrothermal vent gastropods, Alviniconcha marisindica (n = 40) and the scaly-foot gastropod Chrysomallon squamiferum (n = 18), from Kairei and Edmond vent fields on the Central Indian Ridge (23-25 degrees S, about 3000 meter depth). No previous studies have measured metabolism in any Indian Ocean vent animals. After recovering healthy animals to the surface, we performed shipboard closed-chamber respirometry experiments to compare oxygen uptake at different temperatures (10, 16, and 25 degrees C) at surface pressure (1 atm). The physiology of these species is driven by the demands of their chemoautotrophic symbionts. Chrysomallon has very enlarged respiratory and circulatory systems, and endosymbionts are housed in its trophosome-like internal esophageal gland. By contrast, Alviniconcha has chemoautotrophic bacteria within the gill and less extensive associated anatomical adaptations. Thus, we predicted that routine oxygen consumption of Chrysomallon might be higher than that of Alviniconcha. However, oxygen consumption of Chrysomallon was not higher than that of Alviniconcha, and, further, Chrysomallon maintained a steady metabolic demand in two widely separated experimental temperatures, while Alviniconcha did not. We interpret that these findings indicate that (1) the trophosome does not fundamentally increase oxygen requirement compared to other gastropod holobionts, and (2) cold temperatures (10 degrees C) induce a stress response in Alviniconcha, resulting in aberrantly high uptake. While these two large gastropod species co-occur, differences in oxygen consumption may reflect the separate niches they occupy in the vent ecosystem.","2018","235","10.1086/699326","me","not yet"

Spatial patterns have been detected in planktonic bacterial communities at distances <20 m, but little is known about the occurrence of similar variation for other microbial groups and changes in microbial meta-community assembly at different levels of a meta-community. To examine this variation, the biofilm of eight saline ponds were used to investigate processes shaping diversity within ponds (beta) and between ponds (delta). Bacterial and ciliate communities were assessed using ARISA and T-RFLP respectively, while diversity partitioning methods were used to examine the importance of taxonomic turnover and variation partitioning was used to distinguish spatial from environmental determinants. The results show that turnover is important for determining beta- and delta-diversity of biofilms. Spatial factors are important drivers of bacterial beta-diversity but were unimportant for ciliate beta-diversity. Environmental variation was a strong determinant of bacterial and ciliate delta-diversity, suggesting sorting processes are important for assembling pond communities. Determinants of diversity in bacteria are not universal for ciliates, suggesting higher functional redundancy of bacteria or the greater niche breadth of ciliates may be important in discriminating assembly processes between the two organisms.","2018","94","10.1093/femsec/fiy148","me","not yet"

We observed a strong site-to-site individuality in groundwater bacterial communities, likely due to the isolated nature of groundwater bodies leading to unique ecosystems. Rank abundance analysis indicates bacterial diversity is maintained even at low abundances and that the distribution fits classical ecological models for strong competition in resource-limited environments.

The wide spectrum of facies includes deposits of both photic zone (with fusulinids, algae, relicts of microbial and coral reefs) and deeper dysphotic areas (with trilobites, deep-water tentaculitids and ostracods). The results obtained suggest that there were at least three periods of carbonate platform sedimentation during the latest Silurian(?) to Permian. The Late Silurian?-Devonian biota do not show biogeographical differentiation, but rather are distributed globally. Shallow-water foraminifera and some algae of early Pennsylvanian-basal Cisuralian age belong to the warm-water province. These forms are unknown in the Moscovian-Permian of the Boreal Realm (Taimyr, New Siberian Islands, Verkhoyanie, Omolon Massif) but are typical for Alaska and Arctic Canada, Wrangel Island, Chukotka, Polar Urals and Svalbard. The disappearance of warm-water biota during late Artinskian-Kungurian times led to a subsequent predominance of smaller foraminifera: this assemblage with Protonodosaria is widely distributed in Permian deposits of Novaya Zemlya, Urals, Barents Sea and the eastern Arctic. The warm-water Bashkirian-Asselian biota suggests that the Mendeleev-Chukotka-Wrangel block was a low latitude shallow basin with predominant carbonate sedimentation, being part of the Arctida supercontinent, connected temporarily with the eastern margin of Laurasia (Chukcha-Alaska block).","2018","120","10.1016/j.jog.2018.05.001","me","not yet"

Further in-depth analyses of the sequences revealed a positive correlation between resident and active bacterioplankton communities for the particle-associated fraction but not in the fire-living fraction.

The holobionts Agelas spp. and T brasiliensis did not share microbial halogenases, suggesting a species-specific pattern. Bacteria of diverse phylogenetic origins encoding halogenase genes were found to be more abundant in bromopyrrole-containing sponges. The sponge holobionts (e.g., Agelas spp.) with the greatest number of sequences related to clustered, interspaced, short, palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) exhibited the fewest phage halogenases, suggesting a possible mechanism of protection from phage infection by the sponge host.

The structure of the BCs from both countries displayed spatial and temporal variations but were well conserved at the order level and 28% of the OTUs containing 90% of the reads were shared by these BCs. This suggests that micro-environmental conditions occurring within thick Phormidium biofilms strongly shape the associated BCs. A strong and significant distance-decay relationship (r(p) = 0.7; P = 0.001) was found in BCs from New Zealand rivers but the Bray-Curtis dissimilarities between French and New Zealand BCs are in the same order of magnitude of those found between New Zealand BCs.

However, it is not well understood how community structure, including its richness, mass, and composition, influences soil functions. We investigated the relationships between soil productivity and microbial communities in unfertilized arable soils extending over 1000 km in eastern Japan. Soil properties, including C turnover rate, N mineralization rate, microbial C, and various soil chemical properties, were measured. Soil bacterial and fungal communities were analyzed by Illuminas MiSeq using 16S rRNA and ITS regions. In addition, root microbial communities from maize grown in each soil were also investigated. Soil bacterial communities shared many operational taxonomic units (OTUs) among farms. An ordination plot based on correspondence analysis revealed convergent distribution of soil bacterial communities across the farms, which seemed to be a result of similar agricultural management practices. Although fungal communities showed lower richness and a lower proportion of shared OTUs than bacterial communities, community structure between the farms tended to be convergent. On the other hand, root communities had lower richness and a higher abundance of specific taxa than the soil communities. Two soil functions, decomposition activity and soil productivity, were extracted by principal component analysis (PCA) based on eight soil properties. Soil productivity correlated with N mineralization rate, P2O5, and maize growth, but not with decomposition activity, which is characterized by C turnover rate, soil organic C, and microbial mass. Soil productivity showed a significant association with community composition, but not with richness and mass of soil microbial communities. Soil productivity also correlated with the abundance of several specific taxa, both in bacteria and fungi. Root communities did not show any clear correlations with soil productivity. These results demonstrate that community composition and abundance of soil microbial communities play important roles in determining soil productivity.","2018","13","10.1371/journal.pone.0204085","me","not yet"

While these iconic birds have been intensely studied, the composition of their gut microbiome and the factors influencing it, including host species, diet, and biogeography, has not yet been explored. Results: We characterized the microbial community associated with 12 species of Darwins finches using high-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing of fecal samples from 114 individuals across nine islands, including the unusual blood-feeding vampire finch (Geospiza septentrionalis) from Darwin and Wolf Islands. The phylum-level core gut microbiome for Darwins finches included the Firmicutes, Gammaproteobacteria, and Actinobacteria, with members of the Bacteroidetes at conspicuously low abundance. The gut microbiome was surprisingly well conserved across the diversity of finch species, with one exception-the vampire finch-which harbored bacteria that were either absent or extremely rare in other finches, including Fusobacterium, Cetobacterium, Ureaplasma, Mucispirillum, Campylobacter, and various members of the Clostridia-bacteria known from the guts of carnivorous birds and reptiles. Complementary stable isotope analysis of feathers revealed exceptionally high delta N-15 isotope values in the vampire finch, resembling top marine predators. The Galapagos archipelago is also known for extreme wet and dry seasons, and we observed a significant seasonal shift in the gut microbial community of five additional finch species sampled during both seasons.

Although many techniques have been developed to solve this problem, it is still challenging to identify the model parameters accurately and reliably. To improve parameters identification of different photovoltaic models, a multiple learning backtracking search algorithm (MLBSA) is proposed in this paper. In MLBSA, some individuals learn from the current population information and historical population information simultaneously, which aims to maintain population diversity and enhance the exploration ability. While other individuals learn from the best individual of current population to improve the convergence speed and thus enhance the exploitation ability. In addition, an elite strategy based on chaotic local search is developed to further refine the quality of current population. The proposed MLBSA is employed to solve the parameters identification problems of different photovoltaic models, i.e., single diode, double diode, and photovoltaic module.

High silicate concentrations in Arctic waters, as well as sea ice cover and shallow bathymetry, favoured diatom species that were heavily silicified, colonial and capable of producing resting spores, suggesting that these are important traits for this community. In Atlantic waters, diatom species with large surface area to volume ratios were dominant in deep mixed layers, whilst low silicate to nitrate ratios correlated positively with weakly silicified species. Sharp cell projections, such as processes or spines, were positively correlated with water-column stratification, indicating that these traits promote positive buoyancy for diatom cells. Our trait-based analysis directly links cell morphology and physiology with diatom species distribution, allowing new insights on how this method can potentially be applied to explain ecophysiology and shifting biogeographical distributions in a warming climate.","2018","5","10.3389/fmars.2018.00297","me","not yet"

An oceanic mesoscale dipole consists of a cyclonic eddy and an anticyclonic eddy. Dipoles occur frequently in the ocean and usually last from a few days to several months; they have significant impacts on local and global oceanic biological, ecological, and geochemical processes. To better understand how dipoles shape microbial communities, we examined depth-resolved distributions of microbial communities across a dipole in the South China Sea. Our data demonstrated that the dipole had a substantial influence on microbial distributions, community structure, and functional groups both vertically and horizontally. Large alpha and beta diversity differences were observed between anticyclonic and cyclonic eddies in surface and subsurface layers, consistent with distribution changes of major bacterial groups in the dipole. The dipole created uplift, downward transport, enrichment, depletion, and horizontal transport effects. We also found that the edge of the dipole might induce strong subduction, indicated by the presence of Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus in deep waters. Our findings suggest that dipoles, with their unique characteristics, might act as a driver for microbial community dynamics. IMPORTANCE Oceanic dipoles, which consist of a cyclonic eddy and an anticyclonic eddy together, are among the most contrasted phenomena in the ocean. Dipoles generate strong vertical mixing and horizontal advection, inducing biological responses. This study provides vertical profiles of microbial abundance, diversity, and community structure in a mesoscale dipole. We identify the links between the physical oceanography and microbial oceanography and demonstrate that the dipole, with its unique features, could act as a driver for microbial community dynamics, which may have large impacts on both the local and global marine biogeochemical cycles.","2018","84","10.1128/AEM.00614-18","me","not yet"

The integrated agricultural practice (IP) developed in northeast China, by altering row spacing of planting, adopting no-tillage and returning all crop residues, showed great benefit in sustaining crop yield. However, its effect on the soil microbiome remains largely elusive. This study evaluated the effect of 12-year integrated agricultural practice on the structure and activity of the soil microbial community at different soil depths in Chinas Mollisols zone. The experiment consisted of integrated agricultural practice and conventional practice (CP) treatments in a split-plot arrangement. The soil microbial community was characterized by MiSeq sequencing. The results showed that agricultural practices affected 12 phyla, 24 classes, 32 orders and 75 families in the bacterial community and one phyla, four classes, 12 orders and 18 families in the fungal community. Integrated agricultural practice resulted in greater bacterial richness and diversity, and increased the relative abundances of Actinobacteria, Gemmatimonadetes, Verrucomicrobia and Ascomycota, but reduced Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Basidiomycota in the dominant bacterial and fungal phyla. These findings suggested that integrated agricultural practice modified the soil physiochemical properties and consequently altered microbial community structure and diversity, which in turn affected soil microbial biomass and enzyme activities. These changes under integrated agricultural practice could have contributed to the enhanced crop yield, suggesting that IP is a sustainable agricultural practice.","2018","69","10.1111/ejss.12679","me","not yet"

Recently, however, new findings have evoked the role of previously neglected processes, such as dispersal limitation, determining the distribution of a wide range of microorganisms, including cyanobacteria. Here, we reviewed the biogeographic patterns of cyanobacteria with focus on molecular data and the evidences from the published literature for the processes driving these patterns. Also, considerations are made about concept of species, discordances in the taxonomic concepts, and level of taxonomic resolution, and how these affect the biogeographic study of cyanobacteria. From a overview, it can be observed that both environmental and historical factors are important to structure cyanobacteria diversity across time and space. Moreover, different species may exhibit significant differences in their distribution patterns, from possibly cosmopolitan species to other endemic species. However, distribution patterns are closely dependent on the concept of species, besides the taxonomic resolution, spatial and environmental scales, and the biases of the molecular methodologies applied in the studies. Thus, efforts to broaden sampling and sequencing of unknown and less-known species, as well as geographic regions and habitats poorly exploited, are crucial for a better understanding of cyanobacteria biogeography.","2018","820","10.1007/s10750-018-3669-x","me","not yet"
"Choudoir, MJ; Buckley, DH","Phylogenetic conservatism of thermal traits explains dispersal limitation and genomic differentiation of Streptomyces sister-taxa","ISME JOURNAL","The latitudinal diversity gradient is a pattern of biogeography observed broadly in plants and animals but largely undocumented in terrestrial microbial systems. Although patterns of microbial biogeography across broad taxonomic scales have been described in a range of contexts, the mechanisms that generate biogeographic patterns between closely related taxa remain incompletely characterized. Adaptive processes are a major driver of microbial biogeography, but there is less understanding of how microbial biogeography and diversification are shaped by dispersal limitation and drift. We recently described a latitudinal diversity gradient of species richness and intraspecific genetic diversity in Streptomyces by using a geographically explicit culture collection. Within this geographically explicit culture collection, we have identified Streptomyces sister-taxa whose geographic distribution is delimited by latitude. These sister-taxa differ in geographic distribution, genomic diversity, and ecological traits despite having nearly identical SSU rRNA gene sequences. Comparative genomic analysis reveals genomic differentiation of these sister-taxa consistent with restricted gene flow across latitude. Furthermore, we show phylogenetic conservatism of thermal traits between the sister-taxa suggesting that thermal trait adaptation limits dispersal and gene flow across climate regimes as defined by latitude. Such phylogenetic conservatism of thermal traits is commonly associated with latitudinal diversity gradients for plants and animals. These data provide further support for the hypothesis that the Streptomyces latitudinal diversity gradient was formed as a result of historical demographic processes defined by dispersal limitation and driven by paleoclimate dynamics.","2018","12","10.1038/s41396-018-0180-3","me","not yet"

Since the early twentieth century, it has been known that B vitamins play an important role in phytoplankton community dynamics. Limited oceanic dissolved B vitamin distributions indicate that these important coenzymes are present at picomolar levels, which could be too low to support maximal phytoplankton growth, and vast regions of the ocean exist where they are undetectable. Despite their importance, particulate B vitamin concentrations of field microbial populations are unknown. Here we report B vitamin concentrations measured in both the particulate and dissolved fractions, including multiple biochemically relevant B vitamin congeners. We establish their spatial distributions spanning distinct biogeographic and oceanographic regimes in the Mediterranean Sea and the Eastern Atlantic Ocean and show that all congeners are present both dissolved in seawater and in suspended particles. We observe that B vitamins cooccur in patches defined by regional biogeographic and oceanographic features. Additionally, distinct patterns of congener relative abundance in the dissolved and particulate pools provide insight to biological and chemical cycling of these compounds between and within the dissolved and particulate pools. Finally, linear model results demonstrate that model fits of microbial assemblages are strongest when they include both inorganic nutrients and dissolved B vitamin concentrations. We believe that these findings represent an advance in our understanding of B vitamin oceanographic distributions and point to interesting hypotheses of their influence on marine microbial ecology.","2018","123","10.1029/2018JG004554","me","not yet"

Since the turn of the 20th century, MSR water quality has continually rated poorly due to human activity. Acting as first responders, microorganisms can mitigate, exacerbate, and/or serve as predictors for water quality, yet we know little about their community structure or ecology at the whole river scale for large rivers. We collected both biological (16S and 18S rRNA gene amplicons) and physicochemical data from 38 MSR sites over nearly 3000 km from Minnesota to the Gulf of Mexico. Our results revealed a microbial community composed of similar taxa to other rivers but with unique trends in the relative abundance patterns among phyla, operational taxonomic units (OTUs), and the core microbiome. Furthermore, we observed a separation in microbial communities that mirrored the transition from an 8th to 10th Strahler order river at the Missouri River confluence, marking a different start to the lower MSR than the historical distinction at the Ohio River confluence in Cairo, IL. Within MSR microbial assemblages, we identified subgroups of OTUs from the phyla Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Oomycetes, and Heterokonts that were associated with, and predictive of, the important eutrophication nutrients nitrate and phosphate. This study offers the most comprehensive view of MSR microbiota to date, provides important groundwork for higher resolution microbial studies of river perturbation, and identifies potential microbial indicators of river health related to eutrophication.","2018","63","10.1002/lno.10811","me","not yet"

Such taxa enable experimental determination of the traits needed for such microbes to succeed as gut generalists, as well as those traits that impact mammalian fitness. However, the punctuated resolution of microbial taxonomy may limit our ability to detect conserved gut microbes, especially in cases in which broadly related microbial lineages possess shared traits that drive their apparent ubiquity across mammals. To advance the discovery of conserved mammalian gut microbes, we developed a novel ecophylogenetic approach to taxonomy that groups microbes into taxonomic units based on their shared ancestry and their common distribution across mammals. Applying this approach to previously generated gut microbiome data uncovered monophyletic clades of gut bacteria that are conserved across mammals. It also resolved microbial clades exclusive to and conserved among particular mammalian lineages. Conserved clades often manifest phylogenetic patterns, such as cophylogeny with their host, that indicate that they are subject to selective processes, such as host filtering. Moreover, this analysis identified variation in the rate at which mammals acquire or lose conserved microbial clades and resolved a human-accelerated loss of conserved clades. Collectively, the data from this study reveal mammalian gut microbiota that possess traits linked to mammalian phylogeny, point to the existence of a core set of microbes that comprise the mammalian gut microbiome, and clarify potential evolutionary or ecologic mechanisms driving the gut microbiomes diversification throughout mammalian evolution. IMPORTANCE Our understanding of mammalian evolution has become microbiome-aware. While emerging research links mammalian biodiversity and the gut microbiome, we lack insight into which microbes potentially impact mammalian evolution. Microbes common to diverse mammalian species may be strong candidates, as their absence in the gut may affect how the microbiome functionally contributes to mammalian physiology to adversely affect fitness. Identifying such conserved gut microbes is thus important to ultimately assessing the microbiomes potential role in mammalian evolution. To advance their discovery, we developed an approach that identifies ancestrally related groups of microbes that distribute across mammals in a way that indicates their collective conservation. These conserved clades are presumed to have evolved a trait in their ancestor that matters to their distribution across mammals and which has been retained among clade members. We found not only that such clades do exist among mammals but also that they appear to be subject to natural selection and characterize human evolution.","2018","9","10.1128/mBio.01348-18","me","not yet"

A major barrier to mechanistic studies is the lack of tools for the efficient genetic manipulation of wild and diverse bacterial isolates. To address the need for improved molecular tools, we used a collection of proteobacterial isolates native to the zebrafish intestinal microbiota as a testbed to construct a series of modernized vectors that expedite genetic knock-in and knockout procedures across lineages. The innovations that we introduce enhance the flexibility of conventional genetic techniques, making it easier to manipulate many different bacterial isolates with a single set of tools. We developed alternative strategies for domestication-free conjugation, designed plasmids with customizable features, and streamlined allelic exchange using visual markers of homologous recombination. We demonstrate the potential of these tools through a comparative study of bacterial behavior within the zebrafish intestine. Live imaging of fluorescently tagged isolates revealed a spectrum of distinct population structures that differ in their biogeography and dominant growth mode (i.e., planktonic versus aggregated). Most striking, we observed divergent genotype-phenotype relationships: several isolates that are predicted by genomic analysis and in vitro assays to be capable of flagellar motility do not display this trait within living hosts. Together, the tools generated in this work provide a new resource for the functional characterization of wild and diverse bacterial lineages that will help speed the research pipeline from sequencing-based correlations to mechanistic underpinnings. IMPORTANCE A great challenge in microbiota research is the immense diversity of symbiotic bacteria with the capacity to impact the lives of plants and animals. Moving beyond correlative DNA sequencing-based studies to define the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which symbiotic bacteria influence the biology of their hosts is stalling because genetic manipulation of new and uncharacterized bacterial isolates remains slow and difficult with current genetic tools. Moreover, developing tools de novo is an arduous and time-consuming task and thus represents a significant barrier to progress. To address this problem, we developed a suite of engineering vectors that streamline conventional genetic techniques by improving postconjugation counterselection, modularity, and allelic exchange. Our modernized tools and step-by-step protocols will empower researchers to investigate the inner workings of both established and newly emerging models of bacterial symbiosis.","2018","9","10.1128/mBio.01877-18","me","not yet"

Here we introduce TaxAss, a taxonomy assignment workflow that classifies 16S rRNA gene amplicon data using two taxonomy reference databases: a large comprehensive database and a small ecosystem-specific database rigorously curated by scientists within a field. We applied TaxAss to five different freshwater data sets using the comprehensive SILVA database and the freshwater-specific FreshTrain database. TaxAss increased the percentage of the data set classified compared to using only SILVA, especially at fine-resolution family to species taxon levels, while across the freshwater test data sets classifications increased by as much as 11 to 40% of total reads. A similar increase in classifications was not observed in a control mouse gut data set, which was not expected to contain freshwater bacteria. TaxAss also maintained taxonomic richness compared to using only the FreshTrain across all taxon levels from phylum to species. Without TaxAss, most organisms not represented in the FreshTrain were unclassified, but at fine taxon levels, incorrect classifications became significant. We validated TaxAss using simulated amplicon data derived from full-length clone libraries and found that 96 to 99% of test sequences were correctly classified at fine resolution. TaxAss splits a data sets sequences into two groups based on their percent identity to reference sequences in the ecosystem-specific database. Sequences with high similarity to sequences in the ecosystem-specific database are classified using that database, and the others are classified using the comprehensive database. TaxAss is free and open source and is available at https://www.github.com/McMahonLab/TaxAss. IMPORTANCE Microbial communities drive ecosystem processes, but microbial community composition analyses using 16S rRNA gene amplicon data sets are limited by the lack of fine-resolution taxonomy classifications. Coarse taxonomic groupings at the phylum, class, and order levels lump ecologically distinct organisms together. To avoid this, many researchers define operational taxonomic units (OTUs) based on clustered sequences, sequence variants, or unique sequences. These fine-resolution groupings are more ecologically relevant, but OTU definitions are data set dependent and cannot be compared between data sets. Microbial ecologists studying freshwater have curated a small, ecosystem-specific taxonomy database to provide consistent and up-to-date terminology. We created TaxAss, a workflow that leverages this database to assign taxonomy. We found that TaxAss improves fine-resolution taxonomic classifications (family, genus, and species). Fine taxonomic groupings are more ecologically relevant, so they provide an alternative to OTU-based analyses that is consistent and comparable between data sets.","2018","3","10.1128/mSphere.00327-18","me","not yet"

Bifidobacterium species are less prone to possessing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes (ARGs) than other taxa that may colonize infants. Given that AMR is a growing public health crisis and ARGs are present in the gut microbiome of humans from early life, this study examines the correlation between a Bifidobacterium-dominated infant gut microbiome and AMR levels, measured by a culture-independent metagenomic approach both in early life and as infants become toddlers. In general, Bifidobacterium dominance is associated with a significant reduction in AMR in a Bangladeshi cohort, both in the number of acquired AMR genes present and in the abundance of AMR genes. However, by year 2, Bangladeshi infants had no significant differences in AMR related to their early-life Bifidobacterium levels. A generalized linear model including all infants in a previously published Swedish cohort found a significant negative association between log-transformed total AMR and Bifidobacterium levels, thus confirming the relationship between Bifidobacterium levels and AMR. In both cohorts, there was no change between early-life and later-life AMR abundance in high-Bifidobacterium infants but a significant reduction in AMR abundance in low-Bifidobacterium infants. These results support the hypothesis that early Bifidobacterium dominance of the infant gut microbiome may help reduce colonization by taxa containing ARGs. IMPORTANCE Infants are vulnerable to an array of infectious diseases, and as the gut microbiome may serve as a reservoir of AMR for pathogens, reducing the levels of AMR in infants is important to infant health. This study demonstrates that high levels of Bifidobacterium are associated with reduced levels of AMR in early life and suggests that probiotic interventions to increase infant Bifidobacterium levels have the potential to reduce AMR in infants. However, this effect is not sustained at year 2 of age in Bangladeshi infants, underscoring the need for more detailed studies of the biogeography and timing of infant AMR acquisition.","2018","3","10.1128/mSphere.00441-18","me","not yet"

Leveraging associations of current geographic distributions of bacteria with historic climate, we predict that soil bacterial diversity will increase across the majority (similar to 75%) of the Tibetan Plateau and northern North America if bacterial communities equilibrate with existing climatic conditions. This prediction is possible because the current distributions of soil bacteria have stronger correlations with climate from similar to 50 years ago than with current climate. This lag is likely associated with the time it takes for soil properties to adjust to changes in climate. The predicted changes are location specific and differ across bacterial taxa, including some bacteria that are predicted to have reductions in their distributions. These findings illuminate the widespread potential of climate change to influence belowground diversity and the importance of considering bacterial communities when assessing climate impacts on terrestrial ecosystems. IMPORTANCE There have been many studies highlighting how plant and animal communities lag behind climate change, causing extinction and diversity debts that will slowly be paid as communities equilibrate. By virtue of their short generation times and dispersal abilities, soil bacteria might be expected to respond to climate change quickly and to be effectively in equilibrium with current climatic conditions. We found strong evidence to the contrary in Tibet and North America.

One reason for this challenge is that relationships between characteristics of microbiomes and the system-level processes that they influence are often evaluated in the absence of a robust conceptual framework and reported without elucidating the underlying causal mechanisms. The reliance on correlative approaches limits the potential to expand the inference of a single relationship to additional systems and advance the field. We propose that research focused on how microbiomes influence the systems they inhabit should work within a common framework and target known microbial processes that contribute to the system-level processes of interest. Here, we identify three distinct categories of microbiome characteristics (microbial processes, microbial community properties and microbial membership) and propose a framework to empirically link each of these categories to each other and the broader system-level processes that they affect. We posit that it is particularly important to distinguish microbial community properties that can be predicted using constituent taxa (community-aggregated traits) from those properties that cannot currently be predicted using constituent taxa (emergent properties). Existing methods in microbial ecology can be applied to more explicitly elucidate properties within each of these three categories of microbial characteristics and connect them with each other. We view this proposed framework, gleaned from a breadth of research on environmental microbiomes and ecosystem processes, as a promising pathway with the potential to advance discovery and understanding across a broad range of microbiome science.","2018","3","10.1038/s41564-018-0201-z","me","not yet"

In this ecosystem, active methane-oxidizing bacteria are important, because they consume methane while reducing the overall emissions from rice paddy soils. However, the biogeographic distribution of active methanotrophs in paddy soils across Taiwan remains poorly understood. We used DNA based stable isotope probing (DNA-SIP) to show that phylogenetically distinct type I and type II methanotrophs dominated methane oxidation in geographically different paddy soils across Taiwan. High-throughput sequencing of soil 16S rRNA and pmoA genes under field conditions revealed that a type II methanotroph, Methylocystis, was predominant in rice paddy soils. In addition, an uncultured novel type I methanotroph cluster (Rice Paddy Clusters) was detected with the closest relatedness to Methylocaldum 16S rRNA genes in all rice field soils tested. SIP microcosm incubation, however, suggested that the type I methanotrophs Methylosarcina and Methylobacter were significantly stimulated during the consumption of high-concentration methane in five paddy soils with pH > 6.07, whereas the Methylosinus-like microorganisms of type II methanotrophs dominated aerobic methane-oxidizing communities in acidic soil with pH = 5.17. Furthermore, high-throughput sequencing of C-13-pmoA genes indicated the presence of novel methanotrophs that are phylogenetically distantly related to the type I methanotrophs Methylosarcina in four out of five non-acidic paddy soils studied, and the high proportions in the C-13-DNA suggested that these uncultured methanotrophs play an important role in methane oxidation. These results provide strong evidence for the environmental selection of phylogenetically distinct methanotrophs under field conditions. Moreover, community shifts in active methanotrophs likely occurred in response to environmental variations with fluctuating methane concentrations.","2018","124","10.1016/j.soilbio.2018.05.025","me","not yet"

However, relatively little is known about the mechanisms controlling rarity and the processes promoting the development of the rare biosphere. Here, we propose the use of multivariate cut-offs to estimate rare species and phylogenetic null models applied to predefined rare taxa to disentangle the relative influences of ecoevolutionary processes mediating the assembly of the rare biosphere. Importantly, the identification of the factors controlling rare species assemblages is critical for understanding the types of rarity, how the rare biosphere is established, and how rare microorganisms fluctuate over spatiotemporal scales, thus enabling prospective predictions of ecosystem responses.","2018","26","10.1016/j.tim.2018.02.011","me","not yet"

These viruses are ubiquitous in the sea and have impact on marine microbial community structure and dynamics through their lytic infection cycle. However, their diversity and biogeography have been poorly characterized due to the scarce detection of Megaviridae sequences in metagenomes, as well as the limitation of reference sequences used to design specific primers for this viral group. Here, we propose a set of 82 degenerated primers (referred to as MEGAPRIMER), targeting DNA polymerase genes (polBs) of Megaviridae. MEGAPRIMER was designed based on 921 Megaviridae polBs from sequenced genomes and metagenomes. By applying this primer set to environmental DNA meta-barcoding of a coastal seawater sample, we report 5595 non-singleton operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of Megaviridae at 97% nucleotide sequence identity. The majority of the OTUs were found to form diverse clades, which were phylogenetically distantly related to known viruses such as Mimivirus. The Megaviridae OTUs detected in this study outnumber the giant virus OTUs identified in previous individual studies by more than an order of magnitude.

This ecosystem is known to be shaped by many factors, including climate, geography, host nutrition, lifestyle and medication. Thus, knowledge of varying populations with different habits is important for a better understanding of the microbiome. Design We therefore conducted a metagenomic analysis of intestinal microbiota from Kazakh donors, recruiting 84 subjects, including male and female healthy subjects and metabolic syndrome (MetS) patients aged 25-75 years, from the Kazakh administrative centre, Astana. We characterise and describe these microbiomes, the first deep-sequencing cohort from Central Asia, in comparison with a global dataset (832 individuals from five countries on three continents), and explore correlations between microbiota, clinical and laboratory parameters as well as with nutritional data from Food Frequency Questionnaires. Results We observe that Kazakh microbiomes are relatively different from both European and East Asian counterparts, though similar to other Central Asian microbiomes, with the most striking difference being significantly more samples falling within the Prevotella-rich enterotype, potentially reflecting regional diet and lifestyle. We show that this enterotype designation remains stable within an individual over time in 82% of cases. We further observe gut microbiome features that distinguish MetS patients from controls (eg, significantly reduced Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio, Bifidobacteria and Subdoligranulum, alongside increased Prevotella), though these overlap little with previously published reports and thus may reflect idiosyncrasies of the present cohort.

Plant infection assays revealed variable nodulation and symbiotic effectiveness among the 43 bacterial isolates tested. Strains from Ruace generally promoted greater whole-plant growth than the others. 16S rRNA-RFLP analysis of genomic DNA extracted from the rhizobial isolates produced different banding patterns, a clear indication of high bacterial diversity. However, the multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) data showed alignment of the isolates with B. elkanii species. The 16S rRNA sequences of representative soybean isolates selected from each 16S rRNA-RFLP cluster showed their relatedness to B. elkanii, as well as to other Bradyrhizobium species. But a concatenated phylogeny of two housekeeping genes (glnII and gyrB) identified the soybean nodulating isolates as Bradyrhizobium, with very close relatedness to B. elkanii. The nifH and nodC sequences also showed that the majority of the test soybean isolates were closely related to B. elkanii, albeit the inconsistency with some isolates. Taken together, these findings suggest that the B. elkanii group are the preferred dominant microsymbiont of soybean grown in Mozambican soils. Furthermore, the distribution of soybean rhizobia in the agricultural soils of Mozambique was found to be markedly influenced by soil pH, followed by the concentrations of plant-available P and Mn. This study suggested that the identified isolates TUTMJM5, TUTMIITA5A and TUTLBC2B can be used as inoculants for increased soybean production in Mozambique. (C) 2018 The Author(s).

Here, we used high-throughput sequencing to examine the relative contribution of selective and neutral processes in the assembly of abundant and rare subcommunities from three subtropical bays of China. We found that abundant and rare bacterial taxa were distinctly different in diversity, despite the similar biogeographic patterns and strong distance-decay relationships, but the dispersal of rare bacterial taxa was more limited than that of abundant taxa. Furthermore, the environmental (selective processes) and spatial (neutral processes) factors seemed to govern the assembly and biogeography of abundant and rare bacterial subcommunities, although both factors explained only a small fraction of variation within the rare subcommunity. More importantly, variation partitioning (based on adjusted R-2 in redundancy analysis) showed that spatial factors exhibited a slightly greater influence on both abundant and rare subcommunities compared to environmental selection; however, the abundant subcommunity had a much stronger response to spatial factors (17.3% of pure variance was explained) than that shown by the rare bacteria (3.5%). These results demonstrate that environmental selection and neutral processes explained the similar biogeographic patterns of abundant and rare subcommunities, but a large proportion of unexplained variation in the rare taxa (91.1%) implies that more complex assembly mechanisms may exist to shape the rare bacterial assemblages in the three subtropical bays.","2018","12","10.1038/s41396-018-0153-6","me","not yet"

That island characteristics, including remoteness, can profoundly modulate biological diversity has been borne out by studies of animals and plants. By contrast, the processes influencing microbial diversity in island systems remain largely undetermined. We sequenced arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal DNA from plant roots collected on 13 islands worldwide and compared AM fungal diversity on islands with existing data from mainland sites. AM fungal communities on islands (even those >6000 km from the closest mainland) comprised few endemic taxa and were as diverse as mainland communities. Thus, in contrast to patterns recorded among macro-organisms, efficient dispersal appears to outweigh the effects of taxogenesis and extinction in regulating AM fungal diversity on islands. Nonetheless, AM fungal communities on more distant islands comprised a higher proportion of previously cultured and large-spored taxa, indicating that dispersal may be human-mediated or require tolerance of significant environmental stress, such as exposure to sunlight or high salinity. The processes driving large-scale patterns of microbial diversity are a key consideration for attempts to conserve and restore functioning ecosystems in this era of rapid global change.","2018","12","10.1038/s41396-018-0196-8","me","not yet"
"Gomes, SIF; Merckx, VSFT; Hynson, NA","Biological invasions increase the richness of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi from a Hawaiian subtropical ecosystem","BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS","Biological invasions can have various impacts on the diversity of important microbial mutualists such as mycorrhizal fungi, but few studies have tested whether the effects of invasions on mycorrhizal diversity are consistent across spatial gradients. Furthermore, few of these studies have taken place in tropical ecosystems that experience an inordinate rate of invasions into native habitats. Here, we examined the effects of plant invasions dominated by non-native tree species on the diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi in Hawaii. To test the hypothesis that invasions result in consistent changes in AM fungal diversity across spatial gradients relative to native forest habitats, we sampled soil in paired native and invaded sites from three watersheds and used amplicon sequencing to characterize AM fungal communities. Whether our analyses considered phylogenetic relatedness or not, we found that invasions consistently increased the richness of AM fungi. However, AM fungal species composition was not related to invasion status of the vegetation nor local environment, but stratified by watershed. Our results suggest that while invasions can lead to an overall increase in the diversity of microbial mutualists, the effects of plant host identity or geographic structuring potentially outweigh those of invasive species in determining the community membership of AM fungi. Thus, host specificity and spatial factors such as dispersal need to be taken into consideration when examining the effects of biological invasions on symbiotic microbes.","2018","20","10.1007/s10530-018-1710-7","me","not yet"

This study examined co-diversification between the notorious agricultural pest Diaphorina citri and its primary endosymbionts (P-endosymbiont), Candidatus Carsonella ruddii at the population level. RESULTSMaximum likelihood, haplotype network, principal components and Bayesian clustering identified three lineages for D. citri and its P-endosymbiont: a Western clade containing individuals from Pakistan, Bhutan (Phuentsholing), Vietnam (Son La), USA, Myanmar and China (Ruili, Yunnan); a Central clade, with accessions originating from Southwest China, Bhutan (Tsirang) and Bangladesh; and an Eastern clade containing individuals from Southeast Asia, and East and South China. A more diverse genetic structure was apparent in the host mitochondrial DNA than their P-endosymbionts; however, the two sets of data were strongly congruent. CONCLUSIONThis study provides evidence for the co-diversification of D. citri and its P-endosymbiont during the migration from South Asia to East and Southeast Asia. We also suggest that the P-endosymbiont may facilitate investigations into the genealogy and migration history of the host. The biogeography of D. citri and its P-endosymbiont indicated that D. citri colonized and underwent a secondary dispersal from South Asia to East and Southeast Asia.

No study to date has evaluated phylogenetic relationships within this family and the historical pattern of diversification within the group remains unknown. Moreover, species limits, particularly in widespread taxa that show geographic variation, remain unclear. In this study, we delimited species and estimated phylogenetic relationships using multilocus data for the entire family. We then used the inferred diversity along with alternative taxonomic classification schemes to evaluate how lumping and splitting of both taxa and geographical areas influenced biogeographic inference. Species-tree analyses grouped Polioptilidae into four main clades: Microbates, Ramphocaenus, a Polioptila guianensis complex, and the remaining members of Polioptila. Ramphocaenus melanurus was sister to the clade containing M. cinereiventris and M. collaris, which formed a clade sister to all species within Polioptila. Polioptila was composed of two clades, the first of which included the P. guianensis complex; the other contained all remaining species in the genus. Using multispecies coalescent modeling, we inferred a more than 3-fold increase in species diversity, of which 87% represent currently recognized species or subspecies. Much of this diversity corresponded to subspecies that occur in the Neotropics. We identified three polyphyletic species, and delimited 4-6 previously undescribed candidate taxa. Probabilistic modeling of geographic ranges on the species tree indicated that the family likely had an ancestral origin in South America, with all three genera independently colonizing North America. Support for this hypothesis, however, was sensitive to the taxonomic classification scheme used and the number of geographical areas allowed. Our study proposes the first phylogenetic hypothesis for Polioptilidae and provides genealogical support for the reclassification of species limits. Species limits and the resolution of geographical areas that taxa inhabit influence the inferred spatial diversification history.","2018","126","10.1016/j.ympev.2018.03.012","me","not yet"

The coastal northern Zhejiang (in the East China Sea) is a typical subtropical marine ecosystemwithmultiple environmental gradients that has been extensively perturbed by anthropogenic activities. Thus, it is a valuable region to investigate the key drivers that shape microbial biogeography. We investigated microeukaryotic communities in surface waters from115 stations in this region using 18S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing. The microeukaryotic communities were mainly comprised of Dinoflagellata, Ciliophora, Protalveolata, Rhizaria, Stramenopiles and Cryptophyceae. The top abundant operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were highly specific for distinct habitat types, exhibiting significant environment-conditioned features; however, the cosmopolitan OTUs were not strongly correlated with the measured environmental variables. Total phosphorus and suspended particles were major environmental determinants of microeukaryotic alpha-diversity. Environmental variables, particularly temperature, salinity, pH and silicate concentration, were strongly associated with the microeukaryotic community composition. Overall, environmental and spatial factors explained 55.92% of community variation in total with 34.03% of the variation shared, suggesting that spatially structured environmental variations mainly conditioned the microeukaryotic biogeography in this region. Additionally, dispersal limitation, as indicated by the great pure spatial effect and distance-decay pattern, was another important factor. In summary, our results reveal that spatially structured environmental variation and dispersal limitation mainly conditioned the microeukaryotic biogeography. The results may provide useful distribution patterns of microeukaryotes to determine sources of microbes from marine ecosystems that may facilitate the utilization of coastal resources.

However, little is known of their vertical responses to restoration process and their contributions to soil nutrient cycling in the subsurface profiles. Here, we investigated the community assembly of soil bacteria, archaea, and fungi along vertical (i.e., soil depths of 0-300 cm) and horizontal (i.e., distance from trees of 30-90 cm) profiles in a chronosequence of reforestation sites that represent over 30 years of restoration. Results: In the superficial layers (0-80 cm), bacterial and fungal diversity decreased, whereas archaeal diversity increased with increasing soil depth. As reforestation proceeded over time, the vertical spatial variation in bacterial communities decreased, while that in archaeal and fungal communities increased. Vertical distributions of the soil microbiomes were more related to the variation in soil properties, while their horizontal distributions may be driven by a gradient effect of roots extending from the tree. Bacterial and archaeal beta-diversity were strongly related to multi-nutrient cycling in the soil, respectively, playing major roles in deep and superficial layers. Conclusions: Taken together, these results reveal a new perspective on the vertical and horizontal spatial variation in soil microbiomes at the fine scale of single trees. Distinct response patterns underpinned the contributions of soil bacteria, archaea, and fungi as a function of subsurface nutrient cycling during the reforestation of ex-arable land.","2018","6","10.1186/s40168-018-0526-0","me","not yet"

We present here new phylogenetic and coalescent species delimitation analyses to test the multispecific status of Dromiciops relative to the proposed 3 new species. Our molecular analysis is based on partial sequences of 4 nuclear (RAG1, ApoB, vWF, and IRBP) and 2 mitochondrial (12S RNA and Cytb) genes. Genetic distances showed low differentiation among the proposed Dromiciops species, consistent with typical levels of intraspecific variation. Phylogenetic analyses yielded only moderate support for monophyly of D. bozinovici, while depicting polyphyly in D. gliroides and D. mondaca. Species delimitation analyses did not recover the proposed 3-species scenario, and the taxonomic index of congruence among these methods (C-tax = 0.5-1.0) supported monotypic status for Dromiciops.

To understand soil functioning, it is necessary to model the global distribution patterns and functional gene repertoires of soil microorganisms, as well as the biotic and environmental associations between the diversity and structure of both bacterial and fungal soil communities(1-4). Here we show, by leveraging metagenomics and metabarcoding of global topsoil samples (189 sites, 7,560 subsamples), that bacterial, but not fungal, genetic diversity is highest in temperate habitats and that microbial gene composition varies more strongly with environmental variables than with geographic distance. We demonstrate that fungi and bacteria show global niche differentiation that is associated with contrasting diversity responses to precipitation and soil pH. Furthermore, we provide evidence for strong bacterial-fungal antagonism, inferred from antibiotic-resistance genes, in topsoil and ocean habitats, indicating the substantial role of biotic interactions in shaping microbial communities. Our results suggest that both competition and environmental filtering affect the abundance, composition and encoded gene functions of bacterial and fungal communities, indicating that the relative contributions of these microorganisms to global nutrient cycling varies spatially.","2018","560","10.1038/s41586-018-0386-6","me","not yet"

Each of them may possess different regional characteristics with important implications to our health and diseases (i.e., so-termed microbiome associated diseases). Nevertheless, these regional microbiomes are connected with each other through diffusions and migrations. Here, we investigate the within-body (intra-individual) distribution feature of microbiome diversity via diversity area relationship (DAR) modeling, which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been systematically studied previously. We utilized the Hill numbers for measuring alpha and beta-diversities and built 1,200 within-body DAR models with to date the most comprehensive human microbiome datasets of 18 sites from the human microbiome project (HMP) cohort. We established the intra-DAR profile (z-q pattern: the diversity scaling parameter z of the power law (PL) at diversity order q = 0-3), intra-PDO (pair-wise diversity overlap) profile (g-q), and intra-MAD (maximal accrual diversity) profile (D-max-q) for the within-body biogeography of the human microbiome. These profiles constitute the maps of the within-body biogeography, and offer important insights on the within-body distribution of the human microbiome. Furthermore, we investigated the heterogeneity among individuals in their biogeography parameters and found that there is not an average Joe that can represent majority of individuals in a cohort or population. For example, we found that most individuals in the HMP cohort have relatively lower maximal accrual diversity (MAD) or in the long tail of the so-termed power law distribution. In the meantime, there are a small number of individuals in the cohort who possess disproportionally higher MAD values. These findings may have important implications for personalized medicine of the human microbiome.","2018","9","10.3389/fmicb.2018.01619","me","not yet"

To the best of our knowledge, the fundamental question of how the abundance and function of the gut microbiota of domestic dogs evolved to adapt to the changes in host feeding habits has yet to be addressed. In this study, our comparative analyses of gut metagenomes showed that the abundance of gut microbiota between the two species have some significant differences. Furthermore, a number of taxa observed in higher numbers in domestic dogs are related to carbohydrate metabolism, which may be because that there were more complicated polysaccharides in dogs diets than that in wolves diets. A significant difference in the abundance of genes encoding glycosyltransferase family 34 (GT34), carbohydrate-binding module family 25 (CBM25), and glycoside hydrolase family 13 (GH13) between the gut microbiota metagenomes of domestic dogs and gray wolves also supported this observation. Furthermore, the domestic dog gut microbiota has greater valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis and nitrogen metabolism. This result showed that compared with wolves, the domestic dog diet contains a smaller amount of animal protein, which is consistent with the dietary composition of wolves and dogs. Our results indicate that the function and abundance of gut microbiota of domestic dogs has been adapted to domestication, which is of great significance for the ability of domestic dogs to adapt to changes in food composition.","2018","8","10.1186/s13568-018-0652-x","me","not yet"

This is especially true for environmentally transmitted bacteria that cycle between their hosts and the surrounding habitat. As geologic history, biogeography, and other factors such as water temperature, salinity, and physical barriers can inhibit bacterial movement to novel environments, we chose to examine the genetic architecture of Euprymna albatrossae (Mollusca: Cephalopoda) and their Vibrio fischeri symbionts in the Philippine archipelago using a combined phylogeographic approach. Eleven separate sites in thePhilippine islands were examined using haplotype estimates that were examined via nested clade analysis to determine the relationship between E.albatrossae and V.fischeri populations and their geographic location. Identical analyses of molecular variance (AMOVA) were used to estimate variation within and between populations for host and symbiont genetic data. Host animals demonstrated a significant amount of variation within island groups, while symbiont variation was found within individual populations. Nested clade phylogenetic analysis revealed that hosts and symbionts may have colonized this area at different times, with a sudden change in habitat. Additionally, host data indicate restricted gene flow, whereas symbionts show range expansion, followed by periodic restriction to genetic flow. These differences between host and symbiont networks indicate that factors outside the squid influence distribution of Philippine V.fischeri.

Here we analyzed the patterns of ARGs from 42 natural waterbodies (natural lakes and reservoirs) across China using high-throughput approaches. The major ARGs were multidrug genes and the main resistance mechanism was the efflux pump. Although the absolute abundance of ARGs (gene copies/L) in the south/central waterbodies was similar to the northern waterbodies, the normalized abundance of ARGs (ARGs/16S rRNA gene copy number) was higher in the south/central waterbodies than in the north (mainly because of the aminoglycoside and multidrug resistance genes). Human activities strongly correlated with the normalized abundance of ARGs. The composition of ARGs in the waterbodies of south/central China was different from that in the north, and ARGs showed a distance-decay relationship. Anthropogenic factors had the most significant effects on this spatial distribution of ARG composition, followed by the spatial, bacterial and physicochemical factors. These indicate that the ARGs exhibited biogeographical patterns and that multiple ecological mechanisms - such as environmental selection (human activities and local physicochemical parameters) and dispersal limitation - influence distribution of ARGs in these waters. In general, our results provide a valuable ecological insight to explain the large-scale dispersal patterns in ARGs, thereby having potential applications for both public health and environmental management.","2018","117","10.1016/j.envint.2018.05.023","me","not yet"

In this study, biofilms developed in marine and freshwater locations were exposed to prolonged darkness and aging by mimicking ballast water conditions in the laboratory. Upon prolonged darkness, the decay of phytoplankton, as indicated by the decrease in chlorophyll a in marine biofilms, led to remineralization and enhanced bacterial and protist populations. However, the same trend was not observed in the case of freshwater biofilms wherein the microbial parameters (i.e., bacteria, protists) and chlorophyll a decreased drastically. The bacterial community structure in such conditions was evaluated by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR), and results showed that the biofilm bacterial communities changed significantly over a period of time. alpha-Proteobacteria was the most stable taxonomic group in the marine biofilms under dark conditions. However, beta-proteobacteria dominated the freshwater biofilms and seemed to play an important role in organic matter remineralization. gamma-Proteobacteria, which includes most of the pathogenic genera, were affected significantly and decreased in both the types of biofilms. This study revealed that marine biofilm communities were able to adapt better to the dark conditions while freshwater biofilm communities collapsed. Adaptation of tolerant bacterial communities, regeneration of nutrients via cell lysis, and presence of grazers appeared to be key factors for survival upon prolonged darkness. However, the fate of biofilm communities upon discharge in the new environment and their invasion potential is an important topic for future investigation.","2018","76","10.1007/s00248-018-1149-5","me","not yet"

Piglets were given high quality colostrum from birth dam or foster dam upon birth. Twenty-four piglets were randomly assigned at birth to 1 of 3 treatments according to colostrum source and postcolostral milk feeding during, as follow: treatment 1 (n = 8), received colostrum and post-colostral milk feeding from their own dam; treatment 2 (n = 8), received colostrum from foster dam and returned to their own dam for post-colostral milk feeding; and treatment 3 (n = 8), received colostrum and post-colostral milk feeding from foster dam. Genomic DNA was extracted, and the V1-V3 hypervariable region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis was also performed to quantify the expression of toll-like receptors (TLR) 2, TLR 4, TLR 10, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), interferon gamma (IFN gamma), and interleukin (IL) 4 and IL 10. Data analysis revealed that microbial communities were varied according to the GI biogeographical location, with colon being the most diverse section. Bacterial communities in both maternal colostrum and vaginal samples were significantly associated with those present in the fecal samples of piglets. Cross-fostering did not affect bacterial communities present in the piglet GI tract. However, the mRNA expression of TLR and inflammatory cytokines changed (P < 0.05) with biogeographical location in the GI tract, Higher mRNA expression of TLR and inflammatory cytokines was observed in ileum and ileum associated lymph tissues. This study suggests an impact of colostrum and maternal microbial communities on the microbiota development and mucosal immune gene expression in the newly born piglet. This study revealed novel information about the distribution and expression patterns of TLR and inflammatory cytokines in the GI tract of the young pig. Future studies are needed to determine the role and clinical importance of the mucosal microbiota and mucosal gene expression in health, productivity, and susceptibility to the development of GI disease, in piglets.","2018","121","10.1016/j.micpath.2018.05.007","me","not yet"

We explored correlations between environmental variables and macroinvertebrate and soil prokaryote communities in the forest-tundra ecotone of the Yukon, Canada. We found that each tussock tundra site possessed a distinct community of macroinvertebrates and prokaryotes, and therefore represented a unique contribution to regional biodiversity. Prokaryote diversity increased with active layer depth, which could be an effect of temperature, or could be evidence of a species-area effect. Prokaryote diversity decreased with lichen cover, which could be due to antimicrobial properties of lichen. The macroinvertebrate community composition was affected by proximity to a human disturbance, the Dempster Highway. Both macroinvertebrate and prokaryote community compositions changed along the latitudinal transect, as the biome transitioned from taiga to tundra. We also found that the abundance of carnivores relative to herbivores decreased with latitude, which adds to recent evidence that predation decreases with latitude.

To address this research gap, we examined the bacterial spatial turnover rate and the species networks in paired primary and secondary forest soils along a 3700-km north-south transect in eastern China using high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The spatial turnover rate of bacterial communities was higher in primary forests than in secondary, suggesting deforestation increased biotic homogenization at a large geographic scale. Multiple regression on matrices analysis revealed that both geographic distance and soil properties (especially soil pH and organic matter availability) strongly affected bacterial spatial turnover. Through the phylogenetic molecular ecological network approach, we demonstrate that the bacterial network of primary forests was more intricate than in secondary forests. This suggests that microbial species have greater niche-sharing and more interactions in primary forests as compared to secondary forests. On the other hand, the bacterial network in secondary forests was more modular, and the taxa tended to co-occur, with positive correlations accounting for 82% of all potential interactions. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that anthropogenic deforestation has clear effects on bacterial spatial turnover and network interactions, with potential for serious consequences such as microbial diversity loss in primary forests.","2018","123","10.1016/j.soilbio.2018.05.007","me","not yet"

The results indicated that tourism disturbances (mostly sewage discharge and tourist activities) altered the community structure of both abundant and rare bacterioplankton by changing water physicochemical characteristics. Alpha diversity of both abundant and rare taxa did not differ among different anthropogenic disturbance lakes (p > 0.05). Rare bacterial taxa possessed higher alpha diversity than abundant taxa, though rare taxa occupied a tiny portion of abundance (4.5%). Redundancy analysis demonstrated that dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was the most significant correlation variable for constraining the variation of abundant taxa, whereas total phosphorus (TP), ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N), and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) were the most dominant environmental factors constraining the rare taxa, indicating abundant and rare taxa may have different ecological niches.","2018","10","10.3390/w10081075","me","not yet"

Here, we applied CARD-FISH to quantify bacterial community structure from the subtropics to Antarctica between 10 degrees W and 10 degrees E, covering four biogeographic provinces with distinct environmental properties. In addition, incorporation of radiolabeled glucose, amino acids and leucine via MAR-FISH served to quantify the contribution to substrate turnover by selected bacterial groups. SAR11, Bacteroidetes, Gammaproteobacteria and the Roseobacter group accounted for the majority of the bacterial community (52%-88% of DAPI-stained cells) but showed little distributional variation between provinces. In contrast, taxonomic subclades Polaribacter, NS5, NS2b (Bacteroidetes) as well as RCA (Roseobacter group) featured marked geographic variation, illustrated by NMDS and coefficients of variation. Roseobacter (specifically RCA) and Gammaproteobacteria constituted considerable fractions of cells incorporating glucose and amino acids respectively. Bacteroidetes had generally lower activities, but Polaribacter accounted for a major fraction of biomass production at one station near the Antarctic ice shelf. In conclusion, distributional patterns at finer taxonomic level and highest substrate turnover by less abundant taxa highlight the importance of taxonomic subclades in marine carbon fluxes, contributing to the understanding of functional bacterial biogeography in the Southern Ocean.","2018","20","10.1111/1462-2920.14383","me","not yet"

The goal of this study was to understand the geographical distribution of three species of Microbotryum anther-smut fungi that are distantly related but infect the same host plants, the sister species Silenevulgaris and S.uniflora, in Western Europe. We used microsatellite markers to investigate pathogen distribution in relation to host specialization and ecological factors. Microbotryum violaceo-irregulare was only found on S.vulgaris at high elevations in the Alps. Microbotryumlagerheimii could be subdivided into two genetically differentiated clusters, one on S.uniflora in the UK and the second on S.vulgaris in the Alps and Pyrenees. The most abundant pathogen species, M.silenes-inflatae, could be subdivided into four genetic clusters, co-occurring in the Alps, the UK and the Pyrenees, and was found on both S.vulgaris and S.uniflora. All three fungal species had high levels of homozygosity, in agreement with the selfing mating system generally observed in anther-smut fungi. The three pathogen species and genetic clusters had large range overlaps, but occurred at sites with different elevations, temperatures and precipitation levels. The three Microbotryum species thus do not appear to be maintained by host specialization or geographic allopatry, but instead may occupy different ecological niches in terms of environmental conditions.","2018","27","10.1111/mec.14805","me","not yet"

We hypothesize that permafrost communities are shaped by physical constraints imposed by prolonged freezing, and exhibit spatial distributions that reflect dispersal limitation and selective pressures associated with these physical constraints. To test this, we characterized patterns of environmental variation and microbial community composition in permafrost across an Alaskan boreal forest landscape. We used null modeling to estimate the importance of selective and neutral assembly processes on community composition, and identified environmental factors influencing ecological selection through regression and structural equation modeling (SEM). Proportionally, the strongest process influencing community composition was dispersal limitation (0.36), exceeding the influence of homogenous selection (0.21), variable selection (0.16) and homogenizing dispersal (0.05) Fe(II) content was the most important factor explaining variable selection, and was significantly associated with total selection by univariate regression (R-2 = 0.14, P = 0.003). SEM supported a model in which Fe(II) content mediated influences of the Gibbs free energy of the organic matter pool and organic acid concentration on total selection. These findings suggest that the dominant processes shaping microbial communities in permafrost result from the stability of the permafrost environment, which imposes dispersal and thermodynamic constraints.","2018","94","10.1093/femsec/fiy110","me","not yet"

We examined whether the addition of soils collected under various tree species combinations differentially influences lake bacterial communities.

We assessed the taxonomic composition (16S rRNA gene sequencing) and metabolic activity (Biolog Ecoplates) of lake bacteria with and without soil addition, and compared these to initial soil communities. Soil bacterial assemblages showed a strong influence of tree composition, but such community differences were not reflected in the structure of lake communities that developed during the experiment. Bacterial taxa showing the largest abundance increases during incubation were initially present in both lake water and across most soils, and were related to Cytophagales, Burkholderiales and Rhizobiales. No clear metabolic profiles based on inoculum source were found, yet soil-amended communities used 60% more substrate than non-inoculated communities.

However, the knowledge is limited for the association between spatial turnover and temporal turnover. Here, we performed two investigations of the phytoplankton composition in the lakes of the Yangtze River catchment in China in the spring and summer of 2012, which covered regional spatial scale and two-season temporal scale. We analysed the association between temporal and spatial species turnover in phytoplankton. The results showed that 1) the two-season temporal turnover of phytoplankton varied based on the mean values and the coefficient of variance of environmental variables, and pH was the most important variable negatively affecting the temporal turnover; 2) the spatial beta diversity of phytoplankton in summer was higher than that in spring, and the distance decay pattern was significant in summer, but not in spring; 3) the variation in spatial turnover in spring and summer was attributed to the primary environmental variables (nitrogen, phosphorus and underwater available light) and broader-scale spatial variables; 4) the proportion of jointly explained variation of spatial Bray-Curtis dissimilarity by the environment and space increased from similar to 38% (spring) to similar to 55% (summer), which was mainly due to the variation in spatially structured environmental variables during the two-season temporal turnover, such as pH and ion concentrations; 5) the community compositions in summer were more similar between the lakes with similar two-season temporal turnover. These results indicate that the spatial turnover of phytoplankton composition in summer was partially predetermined by the variation in environmental variables and phytoplankton composition during the process of two-season temporal turnover, and highlight the understanding of temporal variations in spatial beta diversity as well as the underlying assembly mechanisms in phytoplankton.","2018","41","10.1111/ecog.03340","me","not yet"

Plankton communities are extremely diverse and geographically variable, and are overwhelmingly composed of low-abundance species. The role of this rare biosphere and its ecological underpinnings are however still unclear. Here, we analyse the extensive dataset generated by the Tara Oceans expedition for marine microbial eukaryotes (protists) and use an adaptive algorithm to explore how metabarcoding-based abundance distributions vary across plankton communities in the global ocean. We show that the decay in abundance of non-dominant operational taxonomic units, which comprise over 99% of local richness, is commonly governed by a power-law. Despite the high spatial turnover in species composition, the power-law exponent varies by less than 10% across locations and shows no biogeographical signature, but is weakly modulated by cell size. Such striking regularity suggests that the assembly of plankton communities in the dynamic and highly variable ocean environment is governed by large-scale ubiquitous processes. Understanding their origin and impact on plankton ecology will be important for evaluating the resilience of marine biodiversity in a changing ocean.","2018","2","10.1038/s41559-018-0587-2","me","not yet"

Here, we examined the influence of long-term fertilization (NPKS) and liming (L) on soil bacterial community structure and its co-occurrence networks by sequencing 16S rRNA gene amplicons. Our results showed that liming counteracted the influence of long-term fertilization on soil pH, but not on soluble organic carbon (SOC) and electrical conductivity (EC). Long-term fertilization affected the abundance of Acidobacteriia, Deltaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria in the 0-10 cm soil, and that of Deltaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria and Gemmatimonadetes in the 10-20 cm soil; whereas liming affected the abundance of Acidobacteriia, Gammaproteobacteria, and Chloracidobacteria in the 0-10 cm soil and that of Deltaproteobacteria in the 10-20 cm soil. The bacterial community structure in soils with the NPKS-L treatment was different from that with other treatments, and was mainly affected by SOC, EC, and NO3- concentration. The link numbers in bacterial co-occurrence networks were decreased by long-term fertilization or liming alone, but were increased by the NPKS-L treatment. Notwithstanding the fact that liming alleviates fertilization-induced soil acidification, this study indicates that liming did not counteract the effect of long-term fertilization on soil bacterial community structure and its co-occurrence pattern, hence cannot recuperate the soil microbial functionality that is changed by long-term fertilization.","2018","123","10.1016/j.soilbio.2018.05.003","me","not yet"

Despite indications that aphids in the same ecological niche show similar levels of facultative symbiont richness, existing reports do not consider the potential role of host plants on aphid microbial community. Little is known about how oligophagy and polyphagy may be influenced by secondary symbiont distribution, mainly because studies on secondary symbiont diversity are biased towards polyphagous aphids from the Northern Hemisphere. Here, we demonstrate the richness and abundance of the most common aphid-associated facultative symbionts in two tropical aphid species, the oligophagous Aphis (Toxoptera) citricidus (Kirkaldy) (Hemiptera: Aphididae) and the polyphagous Aphis aurantii (Boyer de Fonscolombe) (Hemiptera: Aphididae). Aphis citricidus is restricted to Citrus sp. host plants and closely related genera, whereas A. aurantii successfully exploits a wide variety of host plants from different families. Both were collected in the same ecological niche and our data basically indicated the same richness of secondary symbionts, but the abundance at which secondary symbionts occurred was very distinct between the two species. Spiroplasma was the most abundant facultative symbiont associated with A. citricidus and A. aurantii in the ecological niche studied. Single and multiple secondary symbiont infections were observed, but diversity of multiple infections was particularly high in A. citricidus. We discuss our findings and suggest hypotheses to explain causes and consequences of the differences in secondary symbiont diversity observed between these two aphid species.","2018","47","10.1007/s13744-017-0532-0","me","not yet"

Here, we used geostatistical modeling and Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA genes to explore how the main microbial taxa at the phyla level are spatially distributed in a 25-ha karst broadleaf forest in southwest China. Proteobacteria, dominated by Alpha- and Deltaproteobacteria, was the most abundant phylum (34.51%) in the karst forest soils. Other dominating phyla were Actinobacteria (30.73%), and Acidobacteria (12.24%). Soil microbial taxa showed spatial dependence with an autocorrelation range of 44.4-883.0 m, most of them within the scope of the study plots (500 m). An increasing trend was observed for Alphaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria, and Chloroflexi from north to south in the study area, but an opposite trend for Actinobacteria, Acidobacteira, and Firmicutes was observed. Thaumarchaeota, Bacteroidetes, Gemmatimonadetes, and Verrucomicrobia had patchy patterns, Nitrospirae had a unimodal pattern, and Latescibacteria had an intermittent pattern with low and high value strips. Location, soil total phosphorus, elevation, and plant density were significantly correlated with main soil bacterial taxa in the karst forest. Moreover, the total variation in soil microbial communities better explained by spatial factors than environmental variables. Furthermore, a large part of variation (76.8%) was unexplained in the study. Therefore, our results suggested that dispersal limitation was the primary driver of spatial pattern of soil microbial taxa in broadleaved forest in karst areas, and other environmental variables (i.e., soil porosity and temperature) should be taken into consideration.","2018","9","10.3389/fmicb.2018.01691","me","not yet"

Although sinking particles are heavily colonized by microbes, so far it has not been explored whether this process plays a role in transferring prokaryotic diversity from surface to deep oceanic layers. Using Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, we explore here the vertical connectivity of the ocean microbiome by characterizing marine prokaryotic communities associated with five different size fractions and examining their compositional variability from surface down to 4,000 m across eight stations sampled in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans during the Malaspina 2010 Expedition. Our results show that the most abundant prokaryotes in the deep ocean are also present in surface waters. This vertical community connectivity seems to occur predominantly through the largest particles because communities in the largest size fractions showed the highest taxonomic similarity throughout the water column, whereas free-living communities were more isolated vertically. Our results further suggest that particle colonization processes occurring in surface waters determine to some extent the composition and biogeography of bathypelagic communities. Overall, we postulate that sinking particles function as vectors that inoculate viable particle-attached surface microbes into the deep-sea realm, determining to a considerable extent the structure, functioning, and biogeography of deep ocean communities.","2018","115","10.1073/pnas.1802470115","me","not yet"

In order to assess the structure of Burkholderia spp. populations in no-till schemes, culturable Burkholderia spp. strains were quantified and their biodiversity evaluated. Results showed that Burkholderia spp. biodiversity, but not their abundance, clearly displayed a dependence on agricultural managements. We also showed that biodiversity was mainly influenced by two soil factors: Total Organic Carbon and Total Nitrogen.

The chimneys also host rare organisms and may function as a vital part of the oceans seed bank. Many of the reads from active and inactive chimney samples were clustered into OTUs, with low or no resemblance to known species. Since we are unaware of the chemical reactions catalyzed by these unknown organisms, the impact of this diversity loss and bio-geo-coupling is hard to predict.

Here, we characterized the microbial biogeographical characteristics in the GIT of a red panda using high-throughput sequencing technology. Significant differences were observed among GIT segments by beta diversity of microbiota, which were divided into four distinct groups: the stomach, small intestine, large intestine, and feces.

Bacteroidetes. and Proteobacteria, with Limnohabitans and Variovorax as the dominant genera. In spite of these commonalities, bacterial community structures still significantly differed between these two habitats, which may be related to the distance-related dispersal limitation. Their co-occurrence networks were generally both positively structured. The structural analysis showed that OTUs from the same phyla were more likely to co-occur. Although the keystone genera were taxonomically different between Kaidu River and its tributaries, they both shared common trophic properties in exploiting niches under oligotrophic conditions. We noted that their relative abundances were less than 1%, indicating the over-proportional roles of rare genera in the bacterial community.

The soil microbial community diversity was analyzed for plant, soil, geographic properties, and pure spatial distance based on a distance-based approach and with variation partitioning based on canonical redundancy analysis. The soil bacteria richness and alpha diversity index showed marginal positive relationship with plant richness and Shannon index. The bacterial community compositions of both the taxonomic and phylogenetic structures were best explained by the soil pH and plant diversity and soil nutrient availability, with the peak richness at pH 6.8. While the plant, soil and geographic factors were correlated with bacteria community dissimilarity, soil pH and plant diversity, nitrogen availability were relatively independent dominant community assemblage by quantifying taxonomic and phylogenetic turnover.

Abundances of total and bacterial PLFAs had stronger spatial dependence than fungal PLFAs. Gram-positive bacteria had stronger spatial dependence than Gram-negative bacteria, suggesting that Gram-negative bacteria are more susceptible to stochastic factors.

As predicted, -diversity of nosZ communities increased with increasing MAST, within-site -diversity decreased and two (pH and soil moisture) of the three niche widths examined were larger with increasing MAST. 3. We calculated -nearest taxon distance and Raup-Crick metric to quantify the relative influence of the assembly processes determining nosZ assemblage structure. Environmental selection was the primary process driving assemblage structure in all six forests. Homogenizing dispersal was also important at one site, which could be explained by the sites much lower variability in soil chemistry. 4. We used canonical correspondence analysis and multiple regression on matrices to examine relationships between nosZ communities and environmental factors, and found that temperature and spatial distance were significant predictors of nosZ assemblage structure. 5. Overall our results support both theories (MTE and MNT) tested, showing that higher temperatures are correlated with higher local diversity, wider niche breadths and lower within-site turnover rates.","2018","32","10.1111/1365-2435.13091","me","not yet"

Although biotic interactions also underlie the biogeography of plants, the importance of plant-associated microbes is often overlooked when predicting ranges. In particular, symbiotic microbes may influence the distribution of plants that engage in strong interactions with them. We tested whether seedling response to inoculation by ectomycorrhizal fungi explains range size of trees. To examine mechanisms underlying the relationship between range size and response to inoculation, we also examined to what extent sympatry between host and fungi influenced this relationship. Location: Global. Time period: Contemporary. Major taxa studied: Trees and fungi forming ectomycorrhizas. Methods: Using a dataset of 1,275 observations from 126 papers, we calculated mean biomass response (effect size) of 59 tree species to fungal inoculation. We extracted host range area from digitized maps of native distributions, and determined whether hosts were naturally sympatric with fungal species used as inoculum by searching herbaria databases with geospatially referenced data. Results: Tree species with seedling effect sizes falling above or below the average response tended to have small ranges and those with average responses, large ranges. Moreover, hosts inoculated with fungi whose ranges were allopatric to their own had higher biomass compared to those that were inoculated by sympatric fungi, suggesting that the extent of geographical overlap between trees and symbiotic fungi may attenuate the mutualism. Main conclusions: We demonstrate that mycorrhizas may underlie host biogeographical patterns at the continental scale. Our study is novel in the scope of species and scale tested, and points to a possible mechanism underlying this pattern related to the process of mutualism breakdown accruing over time at local geographical scales. For ectomycorrhizal tree species, performance may increase when exposed to fungal partners without a recent shared evolutionary history.","2018","27","10.1111/geb.12745","me","not yet"

By contrast, it is unknown whether microbes inhabiting the same ecosystems exhibit similar biogeographic patterns. To evaluate the biogeographies of tropical protists, we used metabarcoding data of species sampled in the soils of three lowland Neotropical rainforests. Taxa-area and distance-decay relationships for three of the dominant protist taxa and their subtaxa were estimated at both the OTU and phylogenetic levels, with presence-absence and abundance-based measures. These estimates were compared to null models. High local alpha and low regional beta diversity patterns were consistently found for both the parasitic Apicomplexa and the largely free-living Cercozoa and Ciliophora. Similar to animals and plants, the protists showed spatial structures between forests at the OTU and phylogenetic levels, and only at the phylogenetic level within forests. These results suggest that the biogeographies of macro- and micro-organismal eukaryotes in lowland Neotropical rainforests are partially structured by the same general processes. However, and unlike the animals and plants, the protist OTUs did not exhibit spatial structures within forests, which hinders our ability to estimate the local and regional diversity of protists in tropical forests.","2018","27","10.1111/mec.14731","me","not yet"
"Glassman, SI; Martiny, JBH","Broadscale Ecological Patterns Are Robust to Use of Exact Sequence Variants versus Operational Taxonomic Units","MSPHERE","Recent discussion focuses on the best method for delineating microbial taxa, based on either exact sequence variants (ESVs) or traditional operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of marker gene sequences. We sought to test if the binning approach (ESVs versus 97% OTUs) affected the ecological conclusions of a large field study. The data set included sequences targeting all bacteria (16S rRNA) and fungi (internal transcribed spacer [ITS]), across multiple environments diverging markedly in abiotic conditions, over three collection times. Despite quantitative differences in microbial richness, we found that all alpha and beta diversity metrics were highly positively correlated (r > 0.90) between samples analyzed with both approaches. Moreover, the community composition of the dominant taxa did not vary between approaches. Consequently, statistical inferences were nearly indistinguishable. Furthermore, ESVs only moderately increased the genetic resolution of fungal and bacterial diversity (1.3 and 2.1 times OTU richness, respectively). We conclude that for broadscale (e.g., all bacteria or all fungi) alpha and beta diversity analyses, ESV or OTU methods will often reveal similar ecological results. Thus, while there are good reasons to employ ESVs, we need not question the validity of results based on OTUs. IMPORTANCE Microbial ecologists have made exceptional improvements in our understanding of microbiomes in the last decade due to breakthroughs in sequencing technologies. These advances have wide-ranging implications for fields ranging from agriculture to human health. Due to limitations in databases, the majority of microbial ecology studies use a binning approach to approximate taxonomy based on DNA sequence similarity. There remains extensive debate on the best way to bin and approximate this taxonomy. Here we examine two popular approaches using a large field-based data set examining both bacteria and fungi and conclude that there are not major differences in the ecological outcomes. Thus, it appears that standard microbial community analyses are not overly sensitive to the particulars of binning approaches.","2018","3","10.1128/mSphere.00148-18","me","not yet"

In contrast, few studies have focused on the taxonomic groups constituting these communities; thus, our knowledge of their ecological attributes and the drivers determining their composition and distribution is limited. We applied a pyrosequencing approach targeting 165 ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes in soil DNA to a set of 2173 soil samples from France to reach a comprehensive understanding of the spatial distribution of bacteria and archaea and to identify the ecological processes and environmental drivers involved. Taxonomic assignment of the soil 165 rRNA sequences indicated the presence of 32 bacterial phyla or subphyla and 3 archaeal phyla. Twenty of these 35 phyla were cosmopolitan and abundant, with heterogeneous spatial distributions structured in patches ranging from a 43- to 260-km radius. The hierarchy of the main environmental drivers of phyla distribution was soil pH > land management > soil texture > soil nutrients > climate. At a lower taxonomic level, 47 dominant genera belonging to 12 phyla aggregated 62.1% of the sequences. We also showed that the phylum-level distribution can be determined largely by the distribution of the dominant genus or, alternatively, reflect the combined distribution of all of the phylum members. Together, our study demonstrated that soil bacteria and archaea present highly diverse biogeographical patterns on a nationwide scale and that studies based on intensive and systematic sampling on a wide spatial scale provide a promising contribution for elucidating soil biodiversity determinism.","2018","4","10.1126/sciadv.aat1808","me","not yet"

In the present study, antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and bacterial communities were characterized using high-throughput quantitative PCR and Illumina HiSeq sequencing, respectively, in soils from a long-term (25 years) field ex. periment. Treatments included no fertilizers (control), chemical fertilizers (NPK), NPK with straw return (NPKS), pig manure (M), and M with chemical fertilizers (NPKM). Both NPK and NPKS decreased soil pH and induced a substantial shift in the bacterial communities, but had only moderate effect on the ARG diversity and abundance. The effect of straw return was hindered by the dominant influence of NPK. In comparison, additions of pig manure (M and NPKM) maintained the diversity of bacterial community and significantly influenced the ARG profiles by introducing extra ARGs from pig manure and boosting the soil indigenous ARG members. Manured soils harboured clusters of ARGs and transposase genes which were relatively independent of bacterial phylogenetic lineages, suggesting a strong co-occurrence of ARGs in soil bacteria which may result from horizontal gene transfers (HGT). Our results indicate the importance of HGT in the maintenance of ARG composition in agricultural soils, especially those receiving long-term manure applications.","2018","122","10.1016/j.soilbio.2018.04.009","me","not yet"

As a consequence, we still have a poor understanding of their diversity, evolution and biogeography. In this study, a Multi-Locus Sequence Analysis (MLSA) using atpD, dnaA, ftsZ, pgk, and rpoB loci was done on a large set of cultured and uncultured strains, compared to 16S rRNA and correlated to Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) from available Frankia genomes. MLSA provided a robust resolution of Frankia genus phylogeny and clarified the status of unresolved species and complex of species. The robustness of single-gene topologies and their congruence with the MLSA tree were tested. Lateral Gene Transfers (LGT) were few and scattered, suggesting they had no impact on the concatenate topology. The pgk marker - providing the longest sequence, highest mean genetic divergence and least occurrence of LGT - was used to survey an unequalled number of Alnus-infective Frankia - mainly uncultured strains from a broad range of host-species and geographic origins.

Symbiosis genes involved in horizontal transfer have different phylogenies with respect to the core genome of their host. Here, the literature on legume-rhizobium symbioses in field soils was reviewed, and cases of phylogenetic incongruence between rhizobium core and symbiosis genes were collated. The occurrence and importance of horizontal transfer of rhizobial symbiosis genes within and between bacterial genera were assessed. Horizontal transfer of symbiosis genes between rhizobial strains is of common occurrence, is widespread geographically, is not restricted to specific rhizobial genera, and occurs within and between rhizobial genera. The transfer of symbiosis genes to bacteria adapted to local soil conditions can allow these bacteria to become rhizobial symbionts of previously incompatible legumes growing in these soils. This, in turn, will have consequences for the growth, life history, and biogeography of the legume species involved, which provides a critical ecological link connecting the horizontal transfer of symbiosis genes between rhizobial bacteria in the soil to the above-ground floral biodiversity and vegetation community structure.","2018","9","10.3390/genes9070321","me","not yet"

However, the characteristics and internal mechanisms of variation of bacterial community structure over different reclamation periods are currently unclear. The recovery and evolution of soil microbial community structure are important indicators of the level of soil quality improvement of reclaimed soil. Therefore, this study investigated soil samples from coal gangue-filled land after reclamation periods of 1, 6, and 15 years. To accomplish this, 16S rRNA gene libraries were produced to determine the microbial community composition of the soils. In addition, various soil microbial community characteristics in the filled reclamation areas were compared with soil samples from areas unaffected by coal mining. The results showed the following: (1) The diversity and abundance of bacterial communities in reclaimed soils was slightly different from that of natural soils. However, the soil bacterial community structure was highly similar to natural soil after a 15-year reclamation period; therefore, the recovery of bacterial communities can be used as an indicator of the effects of rehabilitation. (2) Some soil physicochemical properties are significantly correlated with the main bacteria in the soil. (3) The dominant bacteria included members of the phyla Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, as well as members of the genera Bacillus, Enterococcus, and Lactococcus. Taken together, the results of this study indicated that the application of microbial remediation technology can be used to adjust the soil microbial community structure, improve soil quality, and shorten the soil recovery period.","2018","10","10.3390/su10072286","me","not yet"

To assess the role of species traits related to dispersal capacities in diatom biogeography. Location Rivers and streams of Sweden sampled over a total area of 450,000km(2). MethodsWe used partial redundancy analyses and variation partitioning coupled with spatial eigenfunctions analyses to separate the effects of environment and space at three different scales on diatoms community structure. As community analyses might give limited insight into species-specific mechanisms, we also performed species by species variation partitioning and the amount of variance explained by each fraction was related to species cell length and attachment to the substrate. Results We found a strong effect of environment and space at a large scale suggesting environmental filtering and dispersal limitation over large distances. Additionally, species-based analyses uncovered an effect of space at fine scale suggesting possible species-specific mass effect dynamic or species sorting driven by missing environmental factors varying at fine scale. Environmental and spatial effects varied strongly among species, but this variation was not explained by cell length and attachment to the substrate. Main conclusions Our results confirm the importance of both environment and dispersal-related processes in controlling diatom community structure and bring new perspectives on the role of dispersal in shaping microbial communities at biogeographical scale. Dispersal being a species-specific mechanism, species associations are not necessarily conserved from site to site and species-based approaches can detect different spatial patterns than those derived from traditional community analyses. Contrary to the conclusions of small-scale analysis of connected metacommunities, interspecific trait variation seems to be of limited importance for long-distance overland dispersal in diatoms.","2018","45","10.1111/jbi.13239","me","not yet"

Patterns that maintain and generate biodiversity of macro-organisms in the Neotropics are widely discussed in the scientific literature, yet the spatial ecology of micro-organisms is largely unknown. The unique character of the tropical Andes and adjacent Amazon lowlands generates a wide gradient of environmental conditions to advance our understanding of what drives community assembly and diversity processes. 2. We analysed the distribution patterns of benthic diatoms (unicellular siliceous algae) as a model group of microbial passive dispersers, including predictors that describe limnological and geo-climatic gradients for a total of 113 waterbodies (0-28 degrees S and 58-80 degrees W), including lakes and streams. Complementary multivariate statistical analyses were performed to correlate (1) community composition and (2) diatom species richness with environmental and spatial factors to infer niche-based and dispersal-based assembly processes, respectively. 3. Results showed that two gradients structured both diatom assemblages and waterbodies, namely climate and landscape configuration. Variance partitioning revealed that broadscale spatial variables (distance-based Morans Eigenvectors) outperformed the two environmental components (limnological and geo-climatic), suggesting dispersal-assembled communities. However, diatom assemblages were structured by geo-climatic (regional) factors in certain lakes in the northern and central Andes, although their effects were partially manifested via local variables after the geographical distances were factored out. In a similar way, climatic and topographic structuring homogenized lake and stream communities within ecoregions, as indicated by the strong overlap between the two community types and the weak correlation between biota and limnological variables. Notably, a significant increase in diatom species richness was related to increased water connectivity, interpreted to indicate that a decrease in the remoteness of the system increase species number. 4. Synthesis. We emphasize the strength of macroecological gradients (landscape configuration and climatic factors) in affecting both diatom diversity and community composition in the South American tropics. In this context, our results and the commonalities of ecoregion patterning with groups of macro-organisms (vegetation) suggest the need to integrate microbial ecology into a macroecology framework to unravel mechanisms behind diversity gradients.","2018","106","10.1111/1365-2745.12934","me","not yet"

Genomic variation in haloarchaea has been linked to viral infection pressure and, in the case of Antarctic communities, can be caused by intergenera gene exchange. To expand understanding of genome variation and biogeography of Antarctic haloarchaea, here we assessed genomic variation between two strains of Halorubrum lacusprofundi that were isolated from Antarctic hypersaline lakes from different regions (Vestfold Hills and Rauer Islands). To assess variation in haloarchaeal populations, including the presence of genomic islands, metagenomes from six hypersaline Antarctic lakes were characterised. Results: The sequence of the largest replicon of each Hrr. lacusprofundi strain (primary replicon) was highly conserved, while each of the strains two smaller replicons (secondary replicons) were highly variable. Intergenera gene exchange was identified, including the sharing of a type I-B CRISPR system. Evaluation of infectivity of an Antarctic halovirus provided experimental evidence for the differential susceptibility of the strains, bolstering inferences that strain variation is important for modulating interactions with viruses. A relationship was found between genomic structuring and the location of variation within replicons and genomic islands, demonstrating that the way in which haloarchaea accommodate genomic variability relates to replicon structuring. Metagenome read and contig mapping and clustering and scaling analyses demonstrated biogeographical patterning of variation consistent with environment and distance effects. The metagenome data also demonstrated that specific haloarchaeal species dominated the hypersaline systems indicating they are endemic to Antarctica. Conclusion: The study describes how genomic variation manifests in Antarctic-lake haloarchaeal communities and provides the basis for future assessments of Antarctic regional and global biogeography of haloarchaea.","2018","6","10.1186/s40168-018-0495-3","me","not yet"

Along the horizontal geographical distances (up to similar to 1000 km), no significant distance-decay pattern in community compositions was observed in any of the tested seawater layers. However, vertical depths (up to similar to 4 km) had strong effects on bacterial community variation, which was apparently governed by dispersal barriers due to limited water mass mixing. In addition, community variations in the vertical direction were strongly correlated with the prominent variation of environmental factors. Apparently, the changes in bacterial community compositions along vertical distances were much greater than those along horizontal distances. The results showed that the distance-decay relationship in bacterial communities at the medium spatial scale was associated with vertical depth rather than with horizontal distance, even though the horizontal distance is much larger than the vertical distance in the open SCS.","2018","8","10.1038/s41598-018-27191-w","me","not yet"

Unraveling the nature and mechanisms of these complex associations will require large longitudinal studies, for which bronchoscopy is poorly suited. Studies of samples obtained by sputum induction and nasopharyngeal brushing or lavage have also reported asthma-associated microbiota characteristics. It remains unknown, however, whether the microbiota detected in these less-invasive sample types reflect the composition of bronchial microbiota in asthma. Results: Bacterial microbiota in paired protected bronchial brushings (BB; n = 45), induced sputum (IS; n = 45), oral wash (OW; n = 45), and nasal brushings (NB; n = 27) from adults with mild atopic asthma (AA), atopy without asthma (ANA), and healthy controls (HC) were profiled using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Though microbiota composition varied with sample type (p < 0.001), compositional similarity was greatest for BB-IS, particularly in AAs and ANAs. The abundance of genera detected in BB correlated with those detected in IS and OW (r median [IQR] 0.869 [0.748-0.942] and 0.822 [0.687-0.909] respectively), but not with those in NB (r = 0.004 [-0.003-0.011]). The number of taxa shared between IS-BB and NB-BB was greater in AAs than in HCs (p < 0.05) and included taxa previously associated with asthma. Of the genera abundant in NB, only Moraxella correlated positively with abundance in BB; specific members of this genus were shared between the two compartments only in AAs. Relative abundance of Moraxella in NB of AAs correlated negatively with that of Corynebacterium but positively with markers of eosinophilic inflammation in the blood and BAL fluid. The genus, Corynebacterium, trended to dominate all NB samples of HCs but only half of AAs (p = 0.07), in whom abundance of this genus was negatively associated with markers of eosinophilic inflammation. Conclusions: Induced sputum is superior to nasal brush or oral wash for assessing bronchial microbiota composition in asthmatic adults. Although compositionally similar to the bronchial microbiota, the microbiota in induced sputum are distinct, reflecting enrichment of oral bacteria. Specific bacterial genera are shared between the nasal and the bronchial mucosa which are associated with markers of systemic and bronchial inflammation.","2018","6","10.1186/s40168-018-0487-3","me","not yet"

In contrast, recent biological studies provide clear evidence for long-term in situ persistence throughout glacial times within most extant Antarctic faunal and several microbial groups. However, even now, the evolutionary history of the Antarctic flora-despite playing major role in Antarctic ecosystems- remains poorly studied. We assessed the diversity, richness and relative age divergences within Schistidium (Grimmiaceae, Bryophyta), the most species-rich plant genus in the Antarctic, as well as the plant genus containing most Antarctic endemic species. We applied phylogenetic and molecular dating methods based on nuclear ribosomal Internal Transcribed Spacer sequences, including all known Antarctic Schistidium species with available sample material. We additionally investigated the continent-wide genetic diversity within the most common Antarctic representative of the genus-the endemic species Schistidium antarctici-and performed preliminary phylogeographic analyses of the bipolar species Schistidium rivulare. Most previously described Antarctic Schistidium species were genetically distinct, confirming their specific status. Interspecific divergences of all species took place at least similar to 1 Mya, suggesting a likely in situ persistence in Antarctica for (at least) all endemic Schistidium species. The widespread endemic species, Schistidium antarctici, diverged from other Antarctic congeners in the late Miocene, thereby revealing the oldest extant plant species currently known in Antarctica, and providing increasing support for the hypothesis of vegetation survival through multiple glacial periods. Within S. antarctic! we identified several distinct clades dividing the eastern Antarctic Peninsula and Scotia Arc islands from the western Antarctic Peninsula and all continental locations. This suggests that the mountainous spine on the Antarctic Peninsula forms a strong barrier to gene flow in this species, while increased genetic diversity in the northern Maritime Antarctic indicates likely glacial refugia in this area. This study provides an important first step toward assessing the diversity and evolutionary history of the most speciose moss genus in the Antarctic. The multi-million year presence of several endemic species contributes to studies on their adaptive potential to survive climate change over both historical and contemporary timescales.","2018","6","10.3389/fevo.2018.00077","me","not yet"

There are reports of about 20,000 to 25,000 ECM fungi that promote plant growth by facilitating enhanced water and nutrient absorption, and provide tolerance to environmental stresses. These below-ground fungi play a key role in terrestrial ecosystems as they regulate plant diversity, nutrient and carbon cycles, and influence soil structure and ecosystem multifunctionality. Because ECM fungi are obligate root symbionts, host plant can have a strong effect on ECM species richness and community composition. The biogeographic pattern and detailed functioning and regulation of these mycorrhizosphere processes are still poorly understood and require detailed study. More recent researches have placed emphasis on a wider, multifunctional perspective, including the effects of ectomycorrhizal symbiosis on plant and microbial communities, and on ecosystem processes. Over the years the main focus in ECM research has been on the study of diversity and specificity of ECM strains, the role of ECM in regeneration of degraded ecosystem, the growth and establishment of seedlings through nutrient acquisition and the mediation of plant responses to various types of stress. In this review, recent progresses in ectomycorrhizal biology are presented, especially the potential role of ECM symbioses in resistance or tolerance to various biotic and abiotic stresses, and in maintinance of plant diversity for proper ecosystem functioning.","2018","84","10.1007/s12229-017-9196-z","me","not yet"

Here, we investigated this question in a set of planktonic lake microbiotas in Eastern Antarctica that represent a natural community ecology experiment. Most of the analysed lakes emerged from the sea during the last 6000 years, giving rise to waterbodies that originally contained marine microbiotas and that subsequently evolved into habitats ranging from freshwater to hypersaline. We show that habitat diversification has promoted selection driven by the salinity gradient in bacterial communities (explaining approximate to 72% of taxa turnover), while microeukaryotic counterparts were predominantly structured by ecological drift (approximate to 72% of the turnover). Nevertheless, we also detected a number of microeukaryotes with specific responses to salinity, indicating that albeit minor, selection has had a role in the structuring of specific members of their communities. In sum, we conclude that microeukaryotes and bacteria inhabiting the same communities can be structured predominantly by different processes. This should be considered in future studies aiming to understand the mechanisms that shape microbial assemblages.","2018","20","10.1111/1462-2920.14265","me","not yet"

To clarify if this biogeographic boundary applies to soil microbes, we examined community structures of ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi across the Tsugaru Strait. We sampled 266 soil cores from six conifer-dominated forests, and collected EM roots for fungal species identification based on internal transcribed spacer sequences. We found that EM fungal communities were primarily influenced by contemporary climate, but not significantly by the geographic barrier or spatial distance. Fungal OTUs appeared to be widespread in the Holarctic regions, suggesting long-distance dispersal capabilities or ancient migrations before the separation of Japanese islands from the continent. The significant effects of climate in this and previous studies imply that EM fungal communities may be sensitive to future climate change. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd and British Mycological Society.

Increasing anthropogenic disturbance poses a threat to AM fungal communities worldwide, but there is little empirical evidence about its potential negative consequences. In this global study, we sequenced AM fungal DNA in soil samples collected from pairs of natural (undisturbed) and anthropogenic (disturbed) plots in two ecosystem types (10 naturally wooded and six naturally unwooded ecosystems). We found that ecosystem type had stronger directional effects than anthropogenic disturbance on AM fungal alpha and beta diversity. However, disturbance increased alpha and beta diversity at sites where natural diversity was low and decreased diversity at sites where natural diversity was high. Cultured AM fungal taxa were more prevalent in anthropogenic than natural plots, probably due to their efficient colonization strategies and ability to recover from disturbance. We conclude that anthropogenic disturbance does not have a consistent directional effect on AM fungal diversity; rather, disturbance equalizes levels of diversity at large scales and causes changes in community functional structure.","2018","24","10.1111/gcb.14131","me","not yet"

Microbial biogeographic patterns almost always appear to be weaker than those reported for plant and animal taxa. It is as yet unclear why this is the case. Some argue that microbial diversity scales differently over space because microbial taxa are fundamentally different in their abundance, longevity and dispersal abilities. Others have argued that differences in scaling are an artifact of how we assess microbial biogeography, driven, for example, by differences in taxonomic resolution, spatial scale, sampling effort or community activity/dormancy. We tested these alternative explanations by comparing bacterial biogeographic patterns in soil to those of trees found in a forest in Gabon. Altering taxonomic resolution, excluding inactive individuals, or adjusting for differences in spatial scale were insufficient to change the rate of microbial taxonomic turnover. In contrast, we account for the differences in spatial turnover between these groups by equalizing sampling extent. Our results suggest that spatial scaling differences between microbial and plant diversity are likely not due to fundamental differences in biology, and that sampling extent should be taken into account when comparing the biogeographic patterns of microorganisms and larger organisms.","2018","12","10.1038/s41396-018-0103-3","me","not yet"

Day-to-day water stagnation in building plumbing can potentially result in water quality deterioration (e.g., lead release or pathogen proliferation), which is a major public health concern. However, little is known about the microbial ecosystem processes in plumbing systems, hindering the development of biological monitoring strategies. Here, we track tap water microbiome assembly in situ, showing that bacterial community composition changes rapidly from the city supply following similar to 6-day stagnation, along with an increase in cell count from 10(3) cells/mL to upwards of 7.8 x 10(5) cells/mL. Remarkably, bacterial community assembly was highly reproducible in this built environment system (median Spearman correlation between temporal replicates = 0.78). Using an island biogeography model, we show that neutral processes arising from the microbial communities in the city water supply (i.e., migration and demographic stochasticity) explained the island community composition in proximal pipes (Goodness-of-fit = 0.48), yet declined as water approached the faucet (Goodness-of-fit = 0.21). We developed a size-effect model to simulate this process, which indicated that pipe diameter drove these changes by mediating the kinetics of hypochlorite decay and cell detachment, affecting selection, migration, and demographic stochasticity. Our study challenges current water quality monitoring practice worldwide which ignore biological growth in plumbing, and suggests the island biogeography model as a useful framework to evaluate building water system quality.","2018","12","10.1038/S41396-018-0101-5","me","not yet"

To determine the effect on soil bacterial communities of disturbances by plant growth (Robinia pseudoacacia) and oil contamination, we sequenced 16S rRNA genes using MiSeq technology. A greenhouse experiment was conducted using 21 agro-soils from 19 provinces in China. Abiotic and biotic disturbances, including treating the soils with sterile water, crude oil, and/or an invasive plant, altered the bacterial community structure in the soils, increased bacterial richness, and reduced bacterial dispersion. Oil contamination exerted stronger effects on the bacterial alpha- and beta-diversity than plant growth. The different responses of bacterial communities and the core microbiome indicated that the disturbances shifted the prevalent soil microbial groups in agro-ecosystems. Among different sampling sites, community dissimilarity increased with spatial distance. Edaphic factors (deterministic processes) exerted the primary influence on the assembly of soil microbiomes in agricultural fields, whereas geographic factors (stochastic processes) were less influential. The bacterial communities in agro-soils from warmer regions were more sensitive to the disturbances. This study provides new insight into the alteration of soil microbiota by plant growth and oil contamination in agro-ecosystems across a large spatial scale.","2018","29","10.1002/ldr.2932","me","not yet"

Viral metagenomic studies have offered insight into broader aspects of phage ecology and repeatedly uncover genes to which we are currently unable to assign function. A combined effort of phage isolation and metagenomic survey of Chicagos nearshore waters of Lake Michigan revealed the presence of Pbunaviruses, relatives of the Pseudomonas phage PB1. This prompted our expansive investigation of PB1-like phages. Genomic signatures of PB1-like phages and Pbunaviruses were identified, permitting the unambiguous distinction between the presence/absence of these phages in soils, freshwater and wastewater samples, as well as publicly available viral metagenomic datasets. This bioinformatic analysis led to the de novo assembly of nine novel PB1-like phage genomes from a metagenomic survey of samples collected from Lake Michigan.

We employed bioinformatic tools to determine NSAP diversity and subcellular localization in microbial genomes; used the corresponding NSAP gene sequences to census metagenomes from diverse ecosystems; studied the effect of long-term land management upon NSAP diversity and abundance. Periplasmic class B NSAPs are poorly represented in marine and terrestrial environments, reflecting their association with enteric and pathogenic bacteria. Periplasmic class A and outer membrane-associated class C NSAPs are cosmopolitan. NSAPs are more abundant in marine than terrestrial ecosystems and class C more abundant than class A genes, except in an acidic peat where class A genes dominate. A clear effect of land management upon gene abundance was identified. NSAP genes are cosmopolitan.

The Arctic has attracted particular interest in such studies but there are large geographic gaps in current knowledge. Here we present what we believe is the first ever study of testate amoebae from the Novaya Zemlya archipelago in Arctic Russia. We investigated testate amoebae from the northernmost island of Novaya Zemlya proper and two smaller islands to the south: Dolgii Island and Matveev Island. We found that testate amoebae were present and active even in the extreme physical environment of northern Novaya Zemlya. Further south in the tundra zone of Dolgii and Matveev islands, testate amoebae were notably abundant and diverse. There were distinct differences in assemblage between all three islands and particularly between Novaya Zemlya and the two more southerly islands. The assemblage of Novaya Zemlya was distinctive with a surprising abundance of larger taxa. Comparisons to previous data suggest that the testate amoeba assemblages of these islands may show more affinity to those further west in Greenland and Svalbard than those further east in Siberia.

It has the greatest number of endemic species in North America, containing abundant living microbialites (including stromatolites and microbial mats) and diverse microbial communities. With the hypothesis that this high biodiversity and the geographic structure should be reflected in the virome, the viral communities in 11 different locations of three drainage systems, Churince, La Becerra, and Pozas Rojas, and in the intestinal contents of 3 different fish species, were analyzed for both eukaryotic and prokaryotic RNA and DNA viruses using next-generation sequencing methods. Double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) virus families were the most abundant (72.5% of reads), followed by single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) viruses (2.9%) and ssRNA and dsRNA virus families (0.5%). Thirteen families had dsDNA genomes, five had ssDNA, three had dsRNA, and 16 had ssRNA. A highly diverse viral community was found, with an ample range of hosts and a strong geographical structure, with very even distributions and signals of endemicity in the phylogenetic trees from several different virus families. The majority of viruses found were bacteriophages but eukaryotic viruses were also frequent, and the large diversity of viruses related to algae were a surprise, since algae are not evident in the previously analyzed aquatic systems of this ecosystem. Animal viruses were also frequently found, showing the large diversity of aquatic animals in this oasis, where plants, protozoa, and archaea are rare. IMPORTANCE In this study, we tested whether the high biodiversity and geographic structure of CCB is reflected in its virome. CCB is an extraordinarily biodiverse oasis in the Chihuahuan desert, where a previous virome study suggested that viruses had followed the marine ancestry of the marine bacteria and, as a result of their long isolation, became endemic to the site. In this study, which includes a larger sequencing coverage and water samples from other sites within the valley, we confirmed the high virus biodiversity and uniqueness as well as the strong biogeographical diversification of the CCB. In addition, we also analyzed fish intestinal contents, finding that each fish species eats different prey and, as a result, presents different viral compositions even if they coexist in the same pond. These facts highlight the high and novel virus diversity of CCB and its lost world status.","2018","84","10.1128/AEM.00465-18","me","not yet"

In this study, we evaluated the roles of niche-based and spatial processes on phytoplankton communities of nine lakes in southern Brazil (spatial distance covered of 220 km). Variation partitioning analysis was employed to determine the relative contributions of environmental and spatial variables on the distribution of prokaryotic (PRP) and eukaryotic (EUP) components of phytoplankton at multispatial extents. C-score analysis was carried out, at intra- and interlake scales, to examine whether phytoplankton species coexist less or more than expected by chance (taxa segregation and aggregation, respectively). Our results showed that, at broader spatial scales, both PRP and EUP distributions are mainly influenced by pure space, while at finer spatial scales, the two groups are mainly influenced by pure environment. PRP distribution at broader spatial scales was also significantly influenced by spatially structured environment, and was in general more affected by spatial variables than by EUP. Finally, a taxa segregation pattern was observed at the interlake scale. In general, our results suggest that niche-based processes are more important in structuring phytoplankton on the local scale while spatial processes on the regional scale.","2018","814","10.1007/s10750-018-3539-6","me","not yet"

Here, we investigated the variability of sediment bacterial communities along a large-scale longitudinal gradient and between dam-controlled and dam-affected sites in riparian zone of the Lancang River, China. The abundance, activity and diversity of sediment bacteria gradually increased in a downstream direction, but were significantly lower in the dam-affected sites than in the dam-controlled sites. The bacterial community compositions differed significantly between the upper-middle-reach and downstream sites at all control sites, and also between the dam-affected and dam-controlled sites. In the cascade dam area, the relative importance of spatial distance and environmental heterogeneity for bacterial distribution differed between the dam-controlled and dam-affected sites. Spatial distance was the primary cause of variations in bacterial community in dam-controlled site. By contrast, the environmental heterogeneity had more control over the bacterial communities than did the spatial distance in dam-affected site. Network analysis showed that the bacterial community in the dam-affected sites had lower connectivity and stability when compared with that in dam-controlled sites. These results suggest the distinct variations in sediment bacterial community in dam-affected sites, which could enhance our understanding of potential ecological effects caused by dam construction.","2018","9","10.3389/fmicb.2018.00999","me","not yet"

The composition and abundance of the disease-suppressive community were assessed from both taxonomic and functional perspectives. Pseudomonas bacteria were selected as a general taxonomic indicator of disease suppressive potential, while genes associated with the biosynthesis of a suite of secondary metabolites provided functional markers (GeoChip 5.0 microarray analysis). The composition of both the Pseudomonas communities and disease suppressive functional genes were responsive to land use. Underlying soil properties explained 37% of the variation in Pseudomonas community structure and up to 61% of the variation in the abundance of disease suppressive functional genes. Notably, measures of soil organic matter quality, C:P ratio, and aromaticity of the dissolved organic matter content (carbon recalcitrance), influenced both the taxonomic and functional disease suppressive potential of the pasture soils.

This is especially true on Deception Island, where geothermal, marine, and polar environments combine to create an extraordinary range of environmental conditions. Our main goal in this study was to understand how microbial community structure is shaped by gradients of temperature, salinity, and geochemistry in polar marine volcanoes. Thereby, we collected surface sediment samples associated with fumaroles and glaciers at two sites on Deception, with temperatures ranging from 0 to 98 degrees C. Sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene was performed to assess the composition and diversity of Bacteria and Archaea. Our results revealed that Deception harbors a combination of taxonomic groups commonly found both in cold and geothermal environments of continental Antarctica, and also groups normally identified at deep and shallow-sea hydrothermal vents, such as hyperthermophilic archaea. We observed a clear separation in microbial community structure across environmental gradients, suggesting that microbial community structure is strongly niche driven on Deception. Bacterial community structure was significantly associated with temperature, pH, salinity, and chemical composition; in contrast, archaeal community structure was strongly associated only with temperature. Our work suggests that Deception represents a peculiar open-air laboratory to elucidate central questions regarding molecular adaptability, microbial evolution, and biogeography of extremophiles in polar regions.","2018","9","10.3389/fmicb.2018.00899","me","not yet"

Our results highlight three adaptive signatures. First, a signature of taxon-function decoupling was detected in the microbial communities of moderately and highly polluted lakes. Second, parallel shifts in taxonomic composition occurred between polluted and unpolluted lakes. Third, variation in the abundance of functional modules suggested a gradual deterioration of ecosystem services (i.e., photosynthesis) and secondary metabolism in highly polluted lakes. Overall, changes in the abundance of taxa, function, andmore importantly the polymetallic resistance genes such as copA, copB, czcA, cadR, cCusA, were correlated with trace metal content (mainly Cadmium) and acidity.

Evolution toward GC-poor genomes has been considered a major adaptive pathway in the oligotrophic ocean, but GC-rich bacteria are also prevalent and highly successful in this environment. We quantify the contribution of multiple factors to the change of genomic GC content of Ruegeria pomeroyi DSS-3, a representative and GC-rich member in the globally abundant Roseobacter Glade, using an agent-based model. The model simulates 2 x 10(8) cells, which allows random genetic drift to act in a realistic manner. Each cell has a whole genome subject to base-substitution mutation and recombination, which affect the carbon and nitrogen requirements of DNA and protein pools. Nonsynonymous changes can be functionally deleterious. Together, these factors affect the growth and fitness. Simulations show that experimentally determined mutation bias toward GC is not sufficient to build the GC-rich genome of DSS-3. While nitrogen availability has been repeatedly hypothesized to drive the evolution of GC content in marine bacterioplankton, our model instead predicts that DSS-3 and its ancestors have been evolving in environments primarily limited by carbon.","2018","12","10.1038/s41396-017-0023-7","me","not yet"

In laboratory models, QS allows bacteria to monitor and respond to their own cell density and is critical for fitness. However, how QS proceeds in natural, spatially structured bacterial communities is not well understood, which significantly hampers our understanding of the emergent properties of natural communities. To address this gap, we assessed QS signaling in the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa in a cystic fibrosis (CF) lung infectionmodel that recapitulates the biogeographical aspects of the natural human infection. In this model, P. aeruginosa grows as spatially organized, highly dense aggregates similar to those observed in the human CF lung. By combining this natural aggregate system with a micro-3D-printing platform that allows for confinement and precise spatial positioning of P. aeruginosa aggregates, we assessed the impact of aggregate size and spatial positioning on both intra-and interaggregate signaling. We discovered that aggregates containing similar to 2,000 signal-producing P. aeruginosa were unable to signal neighboring aggregates, while those containing >= 5,000 cells signaled aggregates as far away as 176 mu m. Not all aggregates within this calling distance responded, indicating that aggregates have differential sensitivities to signal. Overexpression of the signal receptor increased aggregate sensitivity to signal, suggesting that the ability of aggregates to respond is defined in part by receptor levels.

High throughput sequencing was employed to investigate the diversity and composition of bacterial, archaeal and methanogenic communities. Similar biogeographic patterns for bacterial, archaeal and methanogenic communities along the latitudinal gradient were observed, and the biogeographic assemblies of different microbial groups were driven by concurrent factors, including edaphic variables (total organic carbon, total phosphorus and pH) and climatic variables (annual frost days, mean annual temperature, direct solar radiation and mean annual precipitation). MPC was significantly correlated with TOC concentration, and in addition, various functional taxa were positively correlated with MPC (P < 0.05), for example, Sphingomonas, Syntrophomonas, Methanospirillum and Methanoregula, indicating their potential contributions in the methanogenic process, and many of them were fermentative bacteria and methanogens.

The effect size on microbial Shannon index was positively correlated with the changes in soil microbial biomass under N addition. The initial soil conditions, the duration of treatment, the N addition rate and changes in soil organic carbon under N addition all affected the effect sizes of N addition on microbial Shannon index, while changes in soil pH played a minor role.

Here, we provide a first high-throughput sequencing insight into the spatial distribution of benthic cyanobacterial communities in Antarctic lakes located in four distinct, geographically distant ACBRs and covering a range of limnological conditions. Cyanobacterial community structure differed between saline and freshwater lakes. No clear bioregionalization was observed, as clusters of community similarity encompassed lakes from distinct ACBRs. Most phylotypes (77.0%) were related to cyanobacterial lineages (defined at >= 99.0% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity) restricted to the cold biosphere, including lineages potentially endemic to Antarctica (55.4%). The latter were generally rare and restricted to a small number of lakes, while more ubiquitous phylotypes were generally abundant and present in different ACBRs.

In addition to morphological data accumulated over two centuries, most known families and common genera have been linked to DNA sequences in relatively recent barcoding efforts. This backbone of morphologically identified sequences is used here to classify environmental sequences in order to study global and local spatial trends. Analyses of tintinnid SSU rDNA data collected worldwide (about 900 sequences available in NCBI GenBank) and in the northwest Atlantic Ocean (about 500,000 sequences obtained by metabarcoding) support distribution patterns related to salinity, bathymetry and climate/latitude. In addition to the marine-freshwater dichotomy and a pattern of coastal-only taxa known for tintinnids, there is a global trend of phylotypes restricted to brackish or open waters. Local alpha and beta diversity analyses show that assemblage differences among estuarine, coastal and open waters are not significant regarding richness, but are significant in terms of phylogenetic composition. We also confirm spatial restriction of boreal and austral taxa, and stress that cosmopolitanism cannot be assessed by molecular methods that lump data from potentially endemic and commonly widespread taxa. Heterogeneous diversity, biogeography and phylogenetic resolution within and among tintinnid lineages raise questions about the processes that promote their diversification and determine their spatial distributions.","2018","40","10.1093/plankt/fby011","me","not yet"
"Zhang, Y; Li, J; Cheng, XH; Luo, YF; Mai, ZM; Zhang, S","Community differentiation of bacterioplankton in the epipelagic layer in the South China Sea","ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION","The South China Sea (SCS) is the largest marginal sea in the western tropical Pacific Ocean and is characterized by complex physicochemical environments. To date, the biogeographic patterns of the microbial communities have rarely been reported at a basin scale in the SCS. In this study, the bacterial assemblages inhabiting the epipelagic zone across 110 degrees E to 119 degrees E along 14 degrees N latitude were uncovered. The vertical stratification of both bacterial taxa and their potential functions were revealed. These results suggest that the water depth-specific environment is a driver of the vertical bacterioplankton distribution. Moreover, the bacterial communities were different between the eastern stations and the western stations, where the environmental conditions were distinct. However, the mesoscale eddy did not show an obvious effect on the bacterial community due to the large distance between the sampling site and the center of the eddy. In addition to the water depth and longitudinal location of the samples, the heterogeneity of the phosphate and salinity concentrations also significantly contributed to the variance in the epipelagic bacterial community in the SCS. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to report that the variability in epipelagic bacterioplankton is driven by the physicochemical environment at the basin scale in the SCS. Our results emphasize that the ecological significance of bacterioplankton can be better understood by considering the relationship between the biogeographic distribution of bacteria and the oceanic dynamics processes.","2018","8","10.1002/ece3.4064","me","not yet"

However, while the urban soil microbiota underpin these services, we still have limited understanding of the factors that influence their distribution. We characterized soil bacterial communities from turf-grasses associated with urban parks, streets, and residential sites across a major urban environment, including a gradient of human population density. Bacterial diversity was significantly positively correlated with the population density; and species diversity was greater in park and street soils, compared to residential soils. Population density and greenspace type also led to significant differences in the microbial community composition that was also significantly correlated with soil pH, moisture, and texture. Co-occurrence network analysis revealed that microbial guilds in urban soils were well correlated. Abundant soil microbes in high density population areas had fewer interactions, while abundant bacteria in high moisture soils had more interactions. These results indicate the significant influence of changes in urban demographics and land-use on soil microbial communities. As urbanization is rapidly growing across the planet, it is important to improve our understanding of the consequences of urban zoning on the soil microbiota.","2018","52","10.1021/acs.est.7b0641","me","not yet"

However, others have argued for revision of LTREE efforts given perceived limitations in current research priorities and approaches. Yet most arguments about the benefits and failings of LTREE could be argued to reflect the views of only the limited number of scientists who have authored reports on the field, and not the wider community of ecological and evolutionary scientists. To more systematically and quantitatively assess the views of the community on LTREE contributions and future activities, we conducted and here report the results of a survey of ecological and evolutionary scientists at primarily U.S.-based institutions, completed by 1,179 respondents. The survey objectives were to (1) identify and prioritize research questions that are important to address through long-term, ecological field experiments and (2) understand the role that these experiments might play in generating and applying ecological and evolutionary knowledge. Almost 80% (n = 936) of respondents said that long-term experiments had contributed a great deal to ecological understanding. Compared to other research approaches (e.g., short-term, single-site, modeling, or lab), there was overwhelming support that multi-site, long-term research was very important for advancing theory, and that both observational and experimental approaches were required. Respondents identified a wide range of research questions for LTREE to address. The most common topic was the impact of global change (n = 1,352), likely because these processes play out over many years, requiring LTREE approaches to fully understand. Another recurrent theme was the potential of LTREE approaches to build evolutionary understanding across all levels of ecological organization. Critical obstacles preventing some scientists from engaging in LTREE included short-term funding mechanisms and fewer publications, whereas the longer-term value for advancing knowledge and an individuals career were widely recognized. Substantive advances in understanding ecological and evolutionary dynamics then seem likely to be made through engagement in long-term observational and experimental research. However, wider engagement seems dependent on a more supportive research environment and funding structure, through increased institutional acknowledgment of the contributions of long-term research, and greater program support during the establishment and maintenance of research.","2018","88","10.1002/ecm.1289","me","not yet"
"Angermeyer, A; Crosby, SC; Huber, JA","Salt marsh sediment bacterial communities maintain original population structure after transplantation across a latitudinal gradient","PEERJ","Dispersal and environmental selection are two of the most important factors that govern the distributions of microbial communities in nature. While dispersal rates are often inferred by measuring the degree to which community similarity diminishes with increasing geographic distance, determining the extent to which environmental selection impacts the distribution of microbes is more complex. To address this knowledge gap, we performed a large reciprocal transplant experiment to simulate the dispersal of US East Coast salt marsh Spartina alterniflora rhizome-associated microbial sediment communities across a latitudinal gradient and determined if any shifts in microbial community composition occurred as a result of the transplantation. Using bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we did not observe large-scale changes in community composition over a five-month S. alterniflora summer growing season and found that transplanted communities more closely resembled their origin sites than their destination sites. Furthermore, transplanted communities grouped predominantly by region, with two sites from the north and three sites to the south hosting distinct bacterial taxa, suggesting that sediment communities transplanted from north to south tended to retain their northern microbial distributions, and south to north maintained a southern distribution. A small number of potential indicator 16S rRNA gene sequences had distributions that were strongly correlated to both temperature and nitrogen, indicating that some organisms are more sensitive to environmental factors than others. These results provide new insight into the microbial biogeography of salt marsh sediments and suggest that established bacterial communities in frequently-inundated environments may be both highly resistant to invasion and resilient to some environmental shifts. However, the extent to which environmental selection impacts these communities is taxon specific and variable, highlighting the complex interplay between dispersal and environmental selection for microbial communities in nature.","2018","6","10.7717/peerj.4735","me","not yet"

Factors that control gland colonization are poorly understood, but bacterial chemotaxis aids occupation of these sites. We report here that a Helicobacter pylori cytoplasmic chemoreceptor, TlpD, is required for gland colonization in the stomach. tlpD mutants demonstrate gland colonization defects characterized by a reduction in the percentage of glands colonized but not in the number of bacteria per gland. Consistent with TlpDs reported role in reactive oxygen species (ROS) avoidance, tlpD mutants showed hallmarks of exposure to high ROS. To assess the role of host-generated ROS in TlpD-dependent gland colonization, we utilized mice that lack either the ability to generate epithelial hydrogen peroxide or immune cell superoxide. tlpD gland colonization defects were rescued to wild-type H. pylori levels in both of these mutants. These results suggest that multiple types of innate immune-generated ROS production limit gland colonization and that bacteria have evolved specific mechanisms to sense and direct their motility in response to this signal and thus spread throughout tissue.","2018","86","10.1128/IAI.00878-17","me","not yet"

The characteristics that distinguish good model clades from good model organisms (e.g., Drosophila melanogaster) are somewhat different so we first define what constitutes a good evolutionary model.

Given the generally low C/N ratios of paddy soils, we also want to test a hypothesis that the dominant fungi in paddy soils are Ascomycota, which reportedly prefer habitats with low soil C/N ratios. Using quantitative PCR and barcoded pyrosequencing, we investigated the abundance, diversity, and community composition of fungal communities in 30 surface paddy soil samples collected from 10 rice cultivation regions of China. Pearsons correlation, analysis of variance, partial least squares regression, principal coordinates analysis, and variation partition were performed for analyses of gene copy numbers, alpha-diversity, beta-diversity, and relative abundances of fungal taxa and their relationships with environmental factors. The abundance of fungal 18S rRNA gene varied from 10(6.4) to 10(8.6) copies g(-1) soil, and was positively correlated with soil sand, organic matter, and total nitrogen content, and negatively correlated with soil chloride concentration. Ascomycota comprised 88% of total fungal sequences and increased in relative abundance with increasing soil pH and decreasing mean annual temperature (MAT) and precipitation (MAP). The predominance of Ascomycota in fungal communities is probably due to the low soil C/N ratios (9-15) in the paddy soils studied. The alpha-diversity increased with MAT, MAP, and soil nitrate-N and total nitrogen content but decreased with soil pH, clay content, chloride concentration, and C/N ratio. Variation partition revealed that fungal beta-diversity was mainly driven by geographic distance. In paddy soils which are characterized by intensive rice cropping practices, fungal abundance is mainly influenced by soil properties, fungal alpha-diversity is constrained by both climatic factors and soil properties, while fungal community compositions are mainly structured by geographic distance.","2018","18","10.1007/s11368-018-1924-4","me","not yet"

In this context, the study aimed to identify factors affecting the spatial and temporal dynamic of the Mycobacterium, a genus widespread in aquatic ecosystems. Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) density variations were quantified in the water column of freshwater lakes at the regional scale (annual monitoring of 49 lakes in the Paris area) and at the local scale (2-year monthly monitoring in Creteil Lake) by real-time quantitative PCR targeting the atpE gene. At the regional scale, mycobacteria densities in water samples ranged from 6.7 x 10(3) to 1.9 x 10(8) genome units per liter. Density variations were primarily explained by water pH, labile iron, and dispersal processes through the connection of the lakes to a river. In Creteil Lake, no spatial variation of mycobacterial densities was noticed over the 2-year monthly survey, except after large rainfall events. Indeed, storm sewer effluents locally and temporarily increased NTM densities in the water column. The temporal dynamic of the NTM densities in Creteil Lake was associated with suspended solid concentrations. No clear seasonal variation was noticed despite a shift in NTM densities observed over the 2012-2013 winter. Temporal NTM densities fluctuations were well predicted by the neutral community model, suggesting a random balance between loss and gain of mycobacterial taxa within Creteil Lake. This study highlights the importance of considering multiple spatial scales for understanding the spatio-temporal dynamic of bacterial populations in natural environments.","2018","75","10.1007/s00248-017-1088-6","me","not yet"

We established a bio-monitoring network in October of 2014, two months following the disturbance, and evaluated riparian and wetland substrates for microbial community composition and function via 16S and full metagenome sequencing. A total of 234 samples were collected from substrates at 3 depths and 1,650,752 sequences were recorded in a geodatabase framework. These data revealed a wealth of information regarding watershed-scale distribution of microbial community members, as well as community composition, structure, and response to disturbance. Substrates associated with the impact zone were distinct chemically as indicated by elevated pH, nitrate, and sulphate. The microbial community exhibited elevated metabolic capacity for selenate and sulfate reduction and an abundance of chemolithoautotrophs in the Thiobacillus thiophilus/T. denitrificans/T. thioparus clade that may contribute to nitrate attenuation within the affected watershed. The most impacted area (a 6 km stream connecting two lakes) exhibited 30% lower microbial diversity relative to the remaining sites.

Yet, the processes that drive their assembly remain unclear. The perennial shrubs Caragana spp., which is well known for their role in soil and water conservation, provides an ideal system to study the biogeography of rhizosphere microorganism communities within natural ecosystems. In order to detect how bacterial rhizosphere communities vary in terms of community diversity and composition, the rhizosphere bacterial community of three Caragana species, Caragana microphylla Lam., C. liouana Zhao, and C. korshinskii Kom., which distributed in arid and semi-arid region of northern China were investigated. Across species, Proteobacteria (61.1%), Actinobacteria (16.0%), Firmicutes (8.6%), Bacteroidetes (3.0%), Acidobacteria (3.5%), Gemmatimonadetes (1.4%), and Cyanobacteria (1.0%) were the most dominant phyla in the rhizosphere of the three Caragana species. The relative abundance of Cyanobacteria was significantly higher in rhizosphere of C. korshinskii Kom. compared with C. microphylla Lam. and C. liouana Zhao, while the opposite was found for Gemmatimonadetes in rhizosphere of C. microphylla Lam. relative to C. liouana Zhao. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis showed that both diversity and richness of the bacterial rhizosphere communities significantly and positively correlated with soil pH (p < 0.01). Distance-based redundancy analysis indicated that soil properties and non-soil parameters detected there accounted for 47.5% of bacterial phylogenetic structure variation (p < 0.01) all together. Meanwhile, soil total phosphorus accounted for the greatest proportion of community structure variance (9.7%, p < 0.01), followed by electrical conduction (6.5%), altitude (5.8%), soil pH (5.4%), mean annual precipitation (3.6%) and total nitrogen (3.6%, p < 0.05 in all cases). Furthermore, partial Mantel test suggested that bacterial rhizosphere community structure significantly correlated with geographical distance, indicating that the less geographical distant sample sites tend to harbor more similar bacterial rhizosphere community. Our results shed new light on the mechanisms of coevolution and interaction between long-lived plants and their rhizosphere bacterial communities across environmental gradients.","2018","9","10.3389/fmicb.2018.00709","me","not yet"

Consequently, a large portion of the microbes identified by DNA-based methods are either dead or metabolically inactive. Although many exceptions have been noted, the ribosomal RNA fraction of the sample is more likely to represent either viable or metabolically active cells. We examined methodological variations in sample processing using a defined, mock BE microbial community to better understand the scope of technique-based vs. biological-based differences in both ribosomal transcript (rRNA) and gene (DNA) sequence community analysis. Based on in vitro tests, a protocol was adopted for the analysis of the genetic and metabolic pool (DNA vs. rRNA) of air and surface microbiomes within a residential setting. Results: We observed differences in DNA/RNA co-extraction efficiency for individual microbes, but overall, a greater recovery of rRNA using FastPrep (> 50%). Samples stored with various preservation methods at -80 degrees C experienced a rapid decline in nucleic acid recovery starting within the first week, although post-extraction rRNA had no significant degradation when treated with RNAStable. We recommend that co-extraction samples be processed as quickly as possible after collection. The in vivo analysis revealed significant differences in the two components (genetic and metabolic pool) in terms of taxonomy, community structure, and microbial association networks. Rare taxa present in the genetic pool showed higher metabolic potential (RNA: DNA ratio), whereas commonly detected taxa of outdoor origins based on DNA sequencing, especially taxa of the Sphingomonadales order, were present in lower relative abundances in the viable community. Conclusions: Although methodological variations in sample preparations are high, large differences between the DNA and RNA fractions of the total microbial community demonstrate that direct examination of rRNA isolated from a residential BE microbiome has the potential to identify the more likely viable or active portion of the microbial community. In an environment that has primarily dead and metabolically inactive cells, we suggest that the rRNA fraction of BE samples is capable of providing a more ecologically relevant insight into the factors that drive indoor microbial community dynamics.","2018","6","10.1186/s40168-018-0453-0","me","not yet"

However, it remains elusive on how gut microbiota impacts overall growth and more specifically, adipogenesis. Using the pig as an animal model, we compared the differences in bacterial community structure throughout the intestinal tract in two breeds (Landrace and Jinhua) of pigs with distinct phenotypes. The Landrace is a commercial purebred and the Jinhua is a Chinese indigenous, slow-growing breed with high propensity for fat deposition. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we revealed that the bacterial communities are more diverse in the duodenum, jejunum, and cecum of Jinhua pigs than in those of Landrace pigs, whereas the ileal and colonic microbiota show a similar complexity between the two breeds. Furthermore, a number of bacterial taxa differentially exist in Jinhua and Landrace pigs throughout the entire intestinal tract, with the jejunal and ileal microbiome showing the greatest contrast. Functional prediction of the bacterial community suggested increased fatty acid biosynthesis in Jinghua pigs, which could partially explain their adiposity phenotype. Further studies are warranted to experimentally verify the relative contribution of each enriched bacterial species and their effect on adipogenesis and animal growth.","2018","8","10.1038/s41598-018-24289-z","me","not yet"

Here we evaluate the hypothesis that hadal trenches contain unique microbial biodiversity through analyses of the communities present in the bottom waters of the Kermadec and Mariana trenches. Estimates of microbial protein production indicate active populations under in situ hydrostatic pressures and increasing adaptation to pressure with depth. Depth, trench of collection, and size fraction are important drivers of microbial community structure. Many putative hadal bathytypes, such as members related to the Marinimicrobia, Rhodobacteraceae, Rhodospirilliceae, and Aquibacter, are similar to members identified in other trenches. Most of the differences between the two trench microbiomes consists of taxa belonging to the Gammaproteobacteria whose distributions extend throughout the water column. Growth and survival estimates of representative isolates of these taxa under deep-sea conditions suggest that some members may descend from shallower depths and exist as a potentially inactive fraction of the hadal zone. We conclude that the distinct pelagic communities residing in these two trenches, and perhaps by extension other trenches, reflect both cosmopolitan hadal bathytypes and ubiquitous genera found throughout the water column.","2018","13","10.1371/journal.pone.0195102","me","not yet"

At least four Leptospira spp. (L. interrogans, L. borgpetersenii, L. kirschneri, and L. mayottensis) and several yet-unidentified genetic clades contributed to a remarkable regional Leptospira diversity, which was generally related to the local occurrence of the host species rather than the geography. In addition, the genetic structure patterns varied between Leptospira spp., suggesting different evolutionary histories in the region, which might reflect both in situ diversification of native mammals (for L. borgpetersenii) and the more recent introduction of non-native host species (for L. interrogans).

In the Northeast (NE) Pacific Ocean recent studies have found an abundance of seeps at varying spatial separations and within distinct biogeochemical environments ranging in oxygen, depth, and temperature. Here, we examine eight newly discovered seeps and two known seeps covering 800 km and varying across 2000 m water depth to identify: (1) novel megafaunal communities in this geographical region; (2) variations in the microbiome of seep habitats across the margin; (3) spatial and biogeochemical drivers of microbial diversity at seeps. In addition to authigenic carbonates, clam beds, microbial mats, and exposed hydrates - we also observed Siboglinidae tube worm bushes and an anomalous deep-sea barnacle adding to the overall habitats known from the NE Pacific. The microbial communities showed high variability in their spatial distribution and community structure. The seep communities formed distinct groups that included multiple groups of anaerobic methane oxidizing Archaea (ANME; 1, 2ab, 2c, and 3), often co-occurring within one site - however, there were also other sites with clearly dominant members (e.g. ANME-1s at Nehalem Bank). Sulfide oxidizers were dominated by the non-mat forming Campylobacterales and even though vertical gradients in redox potential typify seep sediments, in two cases there was not a significant change in community structure across the top five cm of sediment. We posit that these patterns were driven by bubble-turbation, and bioirrigation by megafauna. A surprising latitudinal trend was observed in species diversity and richness with increasing richness significantly correlated to increasing latitude. Overall, our results demonstrate that heterogeneity is ubiquitous in the seep biome, spanning all faunal classes, and that the understanding of seeps and the drivers of the community structure can be improved by studying seeps at a range of spatial scales.","2018","150","10.1016/j.dsr2.2017.10.016","me","not yet"

This study showed that the alpha diversity of protists, both in the freshwater and in the coastal SCS stations was higher than that in the estuary. The protist community structure also changed along the salinity gradient. The relative sequence abundance of Stramenopiles was highest at stations with lower salinity and decreased with the increasing of salinity. By contrast, the contributions of Alveolata, Hacrobia and Rhizaria to the protistan communities generally increased with the increasing of salinity.

Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of bacterial communities using six different successional soil datasets distributed across different regions. Different relationships between pH and successional age across these datasets allowed us to separate the influences of successional age (i.e., time) from soil pH. We found that extreme acidic or alkaline pH conditions lead to assembly of phylogenetically more clustered bacterial communities through deterministic processes, whereas pH conditions close to neutral lead to phylogenetically less clustered bacterial communities with more stochasticity. We suggest that the influence of pH, rather than successional age, is the main driving force in producing trends in phylogenetic assembly of bacteria, and that pH also influences the relative balance of stochastic and deterministic processes along successional soils. Given that pH had a much stronger association with community assembly than did successional age, we evaluated whether the inferred influence of pH was maintained when studying globally distributed samples collected without regard for successional age. This dataset confirmed the strong influence of pH, suggesting that the influence of soil pH on community assembly processes occurs globally. Extreme pH conditions likely exert more stringent limits on survival and fitness, imposing strong selective pressures through ecological and evolutionary time. Taken together, these findings suggest that the degree to which stochastic vs. deterministic processes shape soil bacterial community assembly is a consequence of soil pH rather than successional age.","2018","12","10.1038/s41396-018-0082-4","me","not yet"

Two types of soil samples (wetland and dryland soils, n = 123) were collected from 641 m to 5,033 m altitudes. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) screening showed that anammox were not widespread, and were only detected in 9 sampling sites of the 50 sites tested by amplifying the 16S rRNA genes. Then, only samples collected from Linzhi (2,715 m), Rikaze (4,030 m), and Naqu (5,011 m), which were positive for the presence of anammox, were further processed to explore the biogeography of anammox bacteria in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Results of high-throughput sequencing targeting the hydrazine synthesis -subunit (hzsB) gene revealed the presence of three known anammox genera (Candidatus Brocadia, Candidatus Jettenia, and Candidatus Kuenenia) in both soil types. Their diversity, community composition, and abundance did not show significant variation with altitude at large scale. However, it was the small-scale environmental heterogeneities between wetland and dryland soils that determined their biogeographical distribution. Specifically, the dryland soils had higher diversity of anammox bacteria than the wetland soils, but their abundance patterns varied. The community composition of anammox bacteria were found to be influenced by soil nitrate content.","2018","7","10.1002/mbo3.556","me","not yet"

Owing to its world-wide distribution, it has been recorded numerous times since the heroic age of the deep-sea exploration in the early 20th century. So far, only 4 species have been described, and no attempts have been made to estimate the real diversity of this peculiar genus. Over the last fifteen years, we have collected specimens of Vanhoeffenella from various deep-sea areas, providing the basis for an integrative taxonomy and biogeography of this genus. Here, we clarify the phylogenetic position of Vanhoeffenella and give an account of its diversity in the Atlantic, Arctic and Southern Oceans (the Weddell Sea) as revealed by genetic marker (SSU rDNA) and morphology. Our study shows that Vanhoeffenella branches within Clade F of monothalamids and incorporates at least 10 putative species. Some could be distinguished by either morphological or molecular features, but only the integrative taxonomic approach provides a robust way to assess their diversity.

In many European countries, commercial cultivation of Bt maize is not allowed. One major reason is the potential variation of the environmental risk across different biogeographical regions. The aim of this study was to collect data about soil nematode communities as bioindicators of unintended effects across geographically diverse maize growing regions in Europe by sampling field sites in Denmark, Slovakia, and Sweden during 2013-2014, and in Spain during 2013. DKC3872YG (Bt maize line MON810) and its near-isogenic line DKC3871 were grown at the sites in Slovakia, Denmark, and Sweden and hybrids DKC6451YG (Bt maize line MON810) and its near-isogenic line DKC6450 were cultivated at the site in Spain. Dominating nematode genera in the maize fields regardless of the field site or maize variants were bacterial feeders Rhabditis, Acrobeloides; root-fungal feeders Filenchus; fungal feeders Aphelenchoides, Aphelenchus; and omnivores Eudorylaimus. A significant effect of the field site location on the total nematode abundance, nematode abundance in trophic groups, diversity of nematode genera, and ecological and functional nematode indices was detected. Significant annual variation was found in the Plant parasite and Structure indices. There were significant differences in the abundances of omnivores and root-fungal feeders and in the Maturity, Channel, and Enrichment indices between Bt and non-Bt maize plots in Denmark in 2013, and in the abundance of fungal feeders in Sweden (2013). On the other hand, no difference was found between the Bt and non-Bt plots at the sites in Spain and Slovakia or at any of the sites in 2014. The effect of the field site location and season on the soil nematode community was more pronounced than that of the Bt genetic modification. We conclude that Bt maize had only a limited or no effect on soil nematode communities.","2018","119","10.1016/j.soilbio.2018.01.023","me","not yet"

Most previous work has relied on studying bacteria and viruses independently, thereby reducing them to two separate communities. Such approaches are unable to capture how these microbial communities interact, such as through processes that maintain community robustness or allow phage-host populations to co-evolve. We implemented a network-based analytical approach to describe phage-bacteria network diversity throughout the human body. We built these community networks using a machine learning algorithm to predict which phages could infect which bacteria in a given microbiome. Our algorithm was applied to paired viral and bacterial metagenomic sequence sets from three previously published human cohorts. We organized the predicted interactions into networks that allowed us to evaluate phage-bacteria connectedness across the human body. We observed evidence that gut and skin network structures were person-specific and not conserved among cohabitating family members. High-fat diets appeared to be associated with less connected networks. Network structure differed between skin sites, with those exposed to the external environment being less connected and likely more susceptible to network degradation by microbial extinction events. This study quantified and contrasted the diversity of virome-microbiome networks across the human body and illustrated how environmental factors may influence phage-bacteria interactive dynamics. This work provides a baseline for future studies to better understand system perturbations, such as disease states, through ecological networks.","2018","14","10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006099","me","not yet"

It has been hypothesized that the magnitude of the mass extinction delayed the subsequent recovery, and so to test this, we undertook the highest resolution study to date of the post-extinction (Griesbachian) microbialite unit on the Great Bank of Guizhou, south China. The benthic community from the microbialite unit is taxonomically diverse when compared to other coeval deposits, recording both inarticulate and articulate brachiopods, crinoids, echinoids, bivalves, gastropods, microconchids, and ostracods. Here we recognize 49 taxa from 4,557 individuals, which raise the known diversity of the Great Bank of Guizhou basal microbialite unit to 84 invertebrate species, making it the most diverse Early Triassic community currently reported. About 89% of the genera are Permian holdovers, whilst only 13% of the species are Permian holdovers. These new data record no temporal trends in the species richness, Simpson diversity, Simpson effective diversity, taxonomic distinctness, functional diversity, or body size of the benthos during the post-extinction microbialite unit. Nevertheless, the small body sizes of the benthic community, prevalence of opportunistic taxa (e.g., Claraia), and the large lophophoral cavity in the lingulid brachiopod, Sinolingularia huananensis, suggests that these animals lived in a highly stressed environment. We propose that the microbialite unit contains a survival fauna in an interval that represents persistent environmental stress from the latest Permian mass extinction event, associated with deoxygenation, high temperatures, elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide levels (pCO(2)), and elevated primary productivity.","2018","33","10.1002/2018PA003328","me","not yet"

Recent work has shown that bacterial communities associated with individual macroalgae possess on a local scale a functional core that is likely derived from diverse members of functional guilds. It is not known whether such functional cores also exist across large spatial scales or between closely related host species. To address this, we studied here the bacterial communities on three species of the green macroalgal genus Ulva from different geographic locations. While the taxonomic composition was too variable to describe a community core, we identified genes that were enriched across all Ulva samples as compared to the communities of the surrounding seawater. Of these core functions, 70% were consistently found and independent of the Ulva species and biogeography, while the remaining functions (similar to 30%) are possibly involved in local or host-specific adaptations. For each host individual, the core functions are provided by bacteria with distinct phylogenetic origin and these bacteria could constitute a global guild of Ulva-associated bacteria. Together, our results demonstrate the presence of a stable core set of functional genes in the bacterial communities associated with closely related host species and across large biogeographies.","2018","27","10.1111/mec.14529","me","not yet"

To understand spatial distribution patterns of soil bacterial community along elevation, we analyzed the soil bacterial community diversity and composition along an elevational gradient of 699-1177 m in a primitive Korean pine forest in Changbai Mountain using the high-throughput sequencing. In total, 149,519 optimized sequences were obtained. Bacterial Shannon index increased along elevation from 699 m to 937 m and started to decrease at the elevation of 1,044 m, showing a humpback curve along elevation. Evenness (ACE index) and richness (Chao index) of the soil bacterial community both decreased with elevation (the highest values of 770 and 762 at 699 m and the lowest values of 548 and 539 at 1,177 m, respectively), all the indices are significantly different between elevations. Bacterial composition at phylum and genus levels had some differences between elevations, but the dominant bacterial populations were generally consistent. Beta-diversity analysis showed a distance-decay pattern of bacterial community similarity at different samples. Soil physical and chemical properties explained 70.78% of the variation in bacterial community structure (soil pH explained 19.95%), and elevational distance only explained 8.42%. In conclusion, the contemporary environmental disturbances are the critical factors in maintaining the bacterial spatial distribution compared with historical contingencies.","2018","7","10.1002/mbo3.529","me","not yet"

While aboveground changes in biodiversity are well documented, the effects on belowground microbial communities are less understood, yet could impact on many ecosystem functions. Here we aimed to identify differences in belowground microbial diversity between forest and grassland sites in a humid tropical mosaic landscape in Papua New Guinea. Using DNA-based amplicon sequencing targeting the 16S rRNA gene, prokaryotic community composition was assessed from surface soil samples. The composition of prokaryotic communities (beta diversity) differed between forest and grassland sites despite maintaining similar richness (alpha diversity) levels. Changes in community structure were small at higher taxonomic levels, but strong at the operational taxonomic unit (OTU) level but for a small subset of taxa. Changes in community composition between sites (based on Bray-Curtis distance) reflected a large rearrangement with species assemblage (OTU) differing by 68%. The results suggest that ecosystem change in this landscape leads to ecological filtering and selection at lower, but not higher taxonomic levels.","2018","125","10.1016/j.apsoil.2017.11.028","me","not yet"

In the extreme cold of Arctic, Antarctic and alpine environments, cyanobacteria are of fundamental ecological importance as primary producers and ecosystem engineers. While their role in biogeochemical cycles is well appreciated, little is known about the genomic makeup of polar and alpine cyanobacteria. In this article, we present ways that genomic techniques might be used to further our understanding of cyanobacteria in cold environments in terms of their evolution and ecology. Existing examples from other environments (e.g. marine/hot springs) are used to discuss how methods developed there might be used to investigate specific questions in the cryosphere. Phylogenomics, comparative genomics and population genomics are identified as methods for understanding the evolution and biogeography of polar and alpine cyanobacteria. Transcriptomics will allow us to investigate gene expression under extreme environmental conditions, and metagenomics can be used to complement tradition amplicon-based methods of community profiling. Finally, new techniques such as single cell genomics and metagenome assembled genomes will also help to expand our understanding of polar and alpine cyanobacteria that cannot readily be cultured.","2018","94","10.1093/femsec/fiy032","me","not yet"
"Delhey, K","Darker where cold and wet: Australian birds follow their own version of Glogers rule","ECOGRAPHY","Glogers rule is usually interpreted as predicting darker coloured animals in warmer and more humid/vegetated regions. The relative importance of temperature and rainfall or vegetation is however unclear, and often only one variable is tested at a time, mainly through proxies. Here, I assess the predictions of Glogers rule for interspecific achromatic plumage variation (dark to light variation) for an entire avifauna (551 species of Australian landbirds). I tested the effects of climatic variables (temperature and rainfall) and vegetation structure on plumage reflectance at species and assemblage level (100 x 100 km cells), controlling for phylogenetic relatedness and spatial autocorrelation. To assess the robustness of these results I compared observed results with those of a null distribution of effects obtained from repeatedly simulating random plumage reflectance evolution on the phylogeny. At both the species and assemblage level, darker coloured birds were found in wetter and colder regions and in more densely vegetated habitats. Simulations confirm results at the species level and the effect of temperature at the assemblage level, but rainfall and vegetation effects at the assemblage level fall within the distribution of simulated effects and should be interpreted with care. Interspecific colour variation in Australian birds supports Glogers rule for rainfall/vegetation, but shows the opposite pattern for temperature. Darker colours in wet and vegetated environments are consistent with the role of melanin pigmentation in preventing feather degradation by bacteria, but also with background-matching for camouflage. Darker plumage might be beneficial in colder regions or detrimental in warmer regions if it affects thermoregulation, a selective force often only assumed to be of importance for ectotherms. The data highlight the need to test the generality of biogeographic rules across levels and at broad scale. Experimental work is needed to confirm the mechanisms linking plumage achromatic variation to climate.","2018","41","10.1111/ecog.03040","me","not yet"

Low genetic variation was found in all loci, both between and within Antarctic and southern South American populations, suggesting a relatively recent (likely within the last million years) colonization of this moss to the Antarctic, as well as a likely severe bottleneck during Pleistocene glaciations in southern South America. We also performed a simple atmospheric transfer modeling approach to study potential colonization rates of small (microscopic/microbial) or spore-dispersed organisms (such as many mosses and lichens). These suggested that the northern Antarctic Peninsula shows potentially regular connectivity from southern South America, with air masses transferring, particularly southbound, between the two regions.

Yet, the response of bacterioplankton communities, critical in regulating energy and matter fluxes in marine ecosystems, to such disturbances is unknown. Metacommunity theory, traditionally used in general ecology for macroorganisms, offers mechanistic understanding on the relative role of spatial differences compared with local environmental conditions (habitat filtering) for community assembly. We examined bacterioplankton metacommunities using 16S rRNA amplicons from the Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ) in the eastern Pacific Ocean and in global ocean transect samples to determine sensitivity of these assemblages to environmental perturbations. Habitat filtering was the main assembly mechanism of bacterioplankton community composition in the epi- and mesopelagic waters of the CCZ and the Tara Oceans transect. Bathy- and abyssopelagic bacterioplankton assemblages were mainly assembled by undetermined metacommunity types or neutral and dispersal-driven patch-dynamics for the CCZ and the Malaspina transect. Environmental disturbances may alter the structure of upper-ocean microbial assemblages, with potentially even more substantial, yet unknown, impact on deep-sea communities. Predicting such responses in bacterioplankton assemblage dynamics can improve our understanding of microbially-mediated regulation of ecosystem services in the abyssal seabed likely to be exploited by future deep-sea mining operations.","2018","10","10.1111/1758-2229.12627","me","not yet"

Major drivers for tropical plant endophytes are undoubtedly seasonality, local habitat conditions and biogeography. However, host specialization and tissue preferences also contribute to the structuring of endophytic mycobiomes. To elucidate such specializations and preferences, we sampled two commercially important, unrelated plant species, Amorphophallus albispathus and Camellia sinensis (tea plant) simultaneously at close proximity. The mycobiomes of different tissue types were assessed with high-throughput amplicon sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer DNA region. Both plants hosted different fungal communities and varied in alpha- and beta-diversity, despite their neighboring occurrence. However, the fungal assemblages of Amorphophallus leaflets shared taxa with the mycobiomes of tea leaves, thereby suggesting common driving forces for leaf-inhabiting fungi irrespective of host plant identity. The mycobiome composition and diversity of tea leaves was clearly driven by leaf age. We suggest that the very youngest tea leaves are colonized by stochastic processes, while mycobiomes of old leaves are rather similar as the result of progressive succession. The biodiversity of fungi associated with A. albispathus was characterized by a large number of unclassified OTUs (at genus and species level) and by tissue-specific composition.This study is the first cultivation-independent high-throughput assessment of fungal biodiversity of an Amorphophallus species, and additionally expands the knowledge base on fungi associated with tea plants.","2018","17","10.1007/s11557-018-1375-8","me","not yet"

We analysed metacommunity structure and functional trait variation in 148 communities of desmids, freshwater green algae, distributed throughout Europe. We delineated biogeographic modules for both taxa and sites using bipartite network analysis given that the taxa of a module co-occurred more often than expected by chance in sites of the same module. The network analysis distinguished two main acidic and neutral habitats, reflecting environmental filtering, and within each habitat separated species pools with distinct geographic locations, representing a plausible influence of historical biogeography. The geographic differentiation was consistent with a hypothesis of glacial refugia on Atlantic coast. Distance decay in community composition in addition to environmental influence further suggested a role of dispersal limitation. Next, we quantified the variation in cell volume and surface-to-volume of taxa within and among communities, to examine morphological and physiological adaptations of desmids in varying environments. Communities from continental climate contained larger desmids. Conversely, we found a functional convergence of smaller, fast-growing, desmids in oceanic regions. Overall, our findings suggest that niche-based processes, dispersal limitation, and historical legacy together drive the distribution and structure of desmid communities. Combining trait- and network-based analyses can resolve long-lasting questions in microbial ecology and biogeography, and could be successfully used in macrobial ecology too.","2018","186","10.1007/s00442-018-4074-x","me","not yet"

Here, we explore the evolutionary dynamics of secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (SMGCs) following lineage divergence of these sister-taxa. These sister-taxa strains contained 310 distinct SMGCs belonging to 22 different gene cluster classes. While there was broad conservation of these 22 gene cluster classes among the genomes analyzed, each individual genome harbored a different number of gene clusters within each class. A total of nine SMGCs were conserved across nearly all strains, but the majority (57%) of SMGCs were strain-specific. We show that while each individual genome has a unique combination of SMGCs, this diversity displays lineage-level modularity. Overall, the northern-derived (NDR) clade had more SMGCs than the southern-derived (SDR) clade (40.7 +/- 3.9 and 33.8 +/- 3.9, mean and S.D., respectively).

The structure of the microbial community in boreal forest soils was comparable with that in temperate forests but was significantly different from the microbial communities in warm temperate, subtropical and tropical forests. The mean annual temperature, soil organic carbon, soil total nitrogen and soil easily soluble phosphorus were the main predictors of latitudinal variance in the soil microbial communities. Soils within the same climatic types had similar properties, and soil MB and PLFAs seemed to change along gradients in the various forest types along the NSTEC.

As inactive endospores that cannot grow at the low ambient temperatures, they are akin to tracer particles in cold sediments, unaffected by factors normally governing microbial biogeography (e.g., selection, drift, mutation). This makes thermophilic endospores ideal model organisms for studying microbial biogeography since their spatial distribution can be directly related to their dispersal history. To assess dispersal histories of estuarine bacteria, thermophilic endospores were enriched from sediments along a freshwater-to-marine transect of the River Tyne in high temperature incubations (50 degrees C). Dispersal histories for 75 different taxa indicated that the majority of estuarine endospores were of terrestrial origin; most closely related to bacteria from warm habitats associated with industrial activity. A subset of the taxa detected were marine derived, with close relatives from hot deep marine biosphere habitats. These patterns are consistent with the sources of sediment in the River Tyne being predominantly terrestrial in origin. The results point to microbial communities in estuarine and marine sediments being structured by bi-directional currents, terrestrial run-off and industrial effluent as vectors of passive dispersal and immigration.","2018","20","10.1111/1462-2920.14056","me","not yet"
"Shen, DD; Jurgens, K; Beier, S","Experimental insights into the importance of ecologically dissimilar bacteria to community assembly along a salinity gradient","ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY","The response of local communities to marine-freshwater transitions and the processes that underlie community assembly are unclear, particularly with respect to bacteria that differ in their life strategies. Here, we implemented a transplant experiment where bacterioplankton from three regions of the Baltic Sea with differing salinities (approximate to 3, 7 and 28 psu) were exposed to each others environmental conditions. We found that habitat specialists were more abundant than generalists after exposure to salinity changes, irrespective of their origins. Most specialists that were selected following a salinity change were rare in the starting communities. Selection for generalists, however, was not specifically driven by the recruitment of either rare or abundant members, suggesting that taxons initial abundance is minor relevant to the growth of generalists. Patterns in phylogenetic relatedness indicated that environmental filtering was the most influential assembly mechanism for specialists, whereas competitive interaction was more important for the assembly of generalists. Altogether, this study shows that large salinity changes promote the establishment of habitat specialists and that deterministic processes vary during community assembly for ecologically dissimilar taxa. We, therefore, propose that distinguishing assembly mechanisms of different community members helps understand and predict community dynamics in response to environmental change.","2018","20","10.1111/1462-2920.14059","me","not yet"
"Dunivin, TK; Shade, A","Community structure explains antibiotic resistance gene dynamics over a temperature gradient in soil","FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY","Soils are reservoirs of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), but environmental dynamics of ARGs are largely unknown. Long-term disturbances offer opportunities to examine microbiome responses at scales relevant for both ecological and evolutionary processes and can be insightful for studying ARGs. We examined ARGs in soils overlying the underground coal seam fire in Centralia, PA, which has been burning since 1962. As the fire progresses, previously hot soils can recover to ambient temperatures, which creates a gradient of fire impact. We examined metagenomes from surface soils along this gradient to examine ARGs using a gene-targeted assembler. We targeted 35 clinically relevant ARGs and two horizontal gene transfer-related genes (intI and repA). We detected 17 ARGs in Centralia: AAC6-Ia, adeB, bla_A, bla_B, bla_C, cmlA, dfra12, intI, sul2, tetA, tetW, tetX, tolC, vanA, vanH, vanX and vanZ. The diversity and abundance of bla_A, bla_B, dfra12 and tolC decreased with soil temperature, and changes in ARGs were largely explained by changes in community structure. We observed sequence-specific biogeography along the temperature gradient and observed compositional shifts in bla A, dfra12 and intI. These results suggest that increased temperatures can reduce soil ARGs but that this is largely due to a concomitant reduction in community-level diversity.","2018","94","10.1093/femsec/fiy016","me","not yet"

Similarly, evolutionary biologists have used historical biogeography (e.g. phylogeography) to understand the importance of geological events as barriers to dispersal that shape species distributions. As the field of microbial biogeography initially developed, the utilisation of highly conserved marker genes, such as the 16S ribosomal RNA gene, stimulated investigations into the biogeographic patterns of the microbial community as a whole.

Herein, we performed a network-based analysis using integrated bacterial and fungal community datasets to delineate the co-occurrence patterns of bulk soil and rhizosphere microbiome and the geographic patterns of network topological. features in 51 soybean fields across China. Results showed that the microbial networks differed between bulk soil and rhizosphere in terms of structure and composition. Compared with the bulk soil networks, the rhizosphere networks had fewer links between bacteria and fungi, lower modularity, and smaller average path length; the global, southern and northern networks of rhizosphere showed similar, higher and lower complexity, respectively. The southern-specific networks of both bulk soil and soybean rhizosphere had more links between bacteria and fungi compared with the northern-specific networks. Additionally, the geographic patterns of network topological features differed between bulk soil and rhizosphere habitats, northern and southern regions. Bacterial sub-networks of both bulk soil and rhizosphere were most influenced by soil pH; fungal sub-networks were related to fewer environmental factors and most influenced by soil Mg content.

Here we posit that the unique composition of aquatic DNA material within a water sample contains relevant information about hydrologic function at multiple temporal scales. In this study, machine learning was used to develop discharge prediction models trained on the relative abundance of bacterial taxa classified into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) based on 16S rRNA gene sequences from six large arctic rivers. We term this approach genohydrology, and show that OTU relative abundances can be used to predict river discharge at monthly and longer timescales. Based on a single DNA sample from each river, the average Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) for predicted mean monthly discharge values throughout the year was 0.84, while the NSE for predicted discharge values across different return intervals was 0.67. These are considerable improvements over predictions based only on the area-scaled mean specific discharge of five similar rivers, which had average NSE values of 0.64 and -0.32 for seasonal and recurrence interval discharge values, respectively. The genohydrology approach demonstrates that genetic diversity within the aquatic microbiome is a large and underutilized data resource with benefits for prediction of hydrologic function.","2018","54","10.1002/2017WR021974","me","not yet"

It is increasingly clear that some larger microorganisms have restricted distributions and plausible to imagine that many human activities could lead to exotic species introductions, but concrete examples are lacking. We investigated an unusual case study: the former mining settlement of Pyramiden on the island of Spitsbergen in the Svalbard archipelago. In around 1983 large quantities of chernozem soils were imported from the southern USSR as part of an urban greening initiative, bringing large numbers of soil organisms to a very different physical environment. Focusing on a readily-identifiable group of protists with documented regional endemism (testate amoebae), we assessed morphospecies assemblages after thirty years. We analysed communities from Pyramiden imported soils and conducted comparisons to: i) nearby locations with non-imported near-natural soils; ii) previously-established datasets from near-natural Svalbard soils and chernozem soils in southern Russia, and iii) regional species inventories from both regions. Our aims were to assess how the community has adapted to the change in physical conditions and identify any evidence for the import of exotic taxa. Our results show significant differences between the assemblages of imported soils and those of nearby reference sites but strict comparisons are complicated by the different treatment of soils in different locations. No taxa were identified which can be unambiguously identified as atypical for the region. Assemblages of imported soils were more similar to those of other sites on Svalbard than to assemblages from southern Russia. Our data are equivocal but suggest that the testate amoeba assemblages of soils transported more than 3000 km northwards have substantially acclimated to the new conditions, contrasting with micro-invertebrates in the same site. Accidental experiments like the soils of Pyramiden provide unique opportunities for long-term, large-scale, soil biological research.","2018","67","10.1016/j.pedobi.2018.02.002","me","not yet"

Here, we investigated the influence of several well-known ecological principles on animal-associated microbiota by characterizing gut microbial specimens from bilaterally symmetrical animals (Bilateria) ranging from flies to whales. A rigorously vetted sample set containing 265 specimens from 64 species was assembled. Bacterial lineages were characterized by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Previously published samples were also compared, allowing analysis of over 1,098 samples in total. A restricted number of bacterial phyla was found to account for the great majority of gut colonists. Gut microbial composition was associated with host phylogeny and diet. We identified numerous gut bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences that diverged deeply from previously studied taxa,identifying opportunities to discover new bacterial types. The number of bacterial lineages per gut sample was positively associated with animal mass, paralleling known species-area relationships from island biogeography and implicating body size as a determinant of community stability and niche complexity. Samples from larger animals harbored greater numbers of anaerobic communities, specifying a mechanism for generating more-complex microbial environments. Predictions for species/abundance relationships from models of neutral colonization did not match the data set, pointing to alternative mechanisms such as selection of specific colonists by environmental niche. Taken together, the data suggest that niche complexity increases with gut size and that niche selection forces dominate gut community construction. IMPORTANCE The intestinal microbiome of animals is essential for health, contributing to digestion of foods, proper immune development, inhibition of pathogen colonization, and catabolism of xenobiotic compounds. How these communities assemble and persist is just beginning to be investigated. Here we interrogated a set of gut samples from a wide range of animals to investigate the roles of selection and random processes in microbial community construction. We show that the numbers of bacterial species increased with the weight of host organisms, paralleling findings from studies of island biogeography. Communities in larger organisms tended to be more anaerobic, suggesting one mechanism for niche diversification. Nonselective processes enable specific predictions for community structure, but our samples did not match the predictions of the neutral model. Thus, these findings highlight the importance of niche selection in community construction and suggest mechanisms of niche diversification.","2018","9","10.1128/mBio.00319-18","me","not yet"

In this study, 50 samples including brines and sediments from Europe, Spanish-Atlantic and South America were analysed by applying the operational phylogenetic unit (OPU) approach in order to understand whether microbial community structures in hypersaline environments exhibited biogeographical patterns. The fine-tuned identification of approximately 1000 OPUs (almost equivalent to species) using multivariate analysis revealed regionally distinct taxa compositions. This segregation was more diffuse at the genus level and pointed to a phylogenetic and metabolic redundancy at the higher taxa level, where their different species acquired distinct advantages related to the regional physicochemical idiosyncrasies. The presence of previously undescribed groups was also shown in these environments, such as Parcubacteria, or members of Nanohaloarchaeota in anaerobic hypersaline sediments. Finally, an important OPU overlap was observed between anoxic sediments and their overlaying brines, indicating versatile metabolism for the pelagic organisms. (C) 2017 Elsevier GmbH.

A total of 328 taxa, including morphotypes, were identified from 2091 specimens. The fluorescence patterns under an epifluorescence microscope were mainly classified into five groups: 1) R & D; 2) R-G; 3) Y-B; 4) Periph-R; and 5) Pale-R. There were 37 species/morphotypes with the R&D pattern in the orders Collodaria, Entactinaria, Nassellaria, and Spumellaria. The R-G and Y-B patterns were confirmed in only four species (Dictyocoryne profunda, D. truncata, Spongaster tetras tetras, S. tetras irregularis) of our identified 328 taxa, suggesting a strong species-specific effect on the presence of PE-containing Synechococcus-type cyanobacteria. In the Periph-R pattern, red fluorescence is emitted from the peripheral part inside flat spumellarians, suggesting that the source of this pale red fluorescence is photosynthetic organisms digested by radiolarians. In particular, taxa with the R&D pattern can be classified into three groups: 1) obligate associations; 2) facultative associations; and 3) non-associations. Many taxa belonging to Acanthodesmiidae and Lophospyris have a great number of symbiotic dinoflagellates outside the central capsule. However, the Acanthodesmiidae includes non-photosynthetic holobionts (Amphispyris and Ceratobotrys borealis), suggesting different environmental adaptability in some acanthodesmiid species. In contrast with the obligate symbiosis tendency in Acanthodesmiidae, the Lophophaenidae tends to have non-photosynthetic holobionts. In Spumellaria, one significant tendency was recognized in Tetrapyle and Phorticium as obligate dinoflagellate holobionts. Thus, Tetrapyle and Phorticium are useful for tracing oceanographic conditions in the euphotic zone. Dictyocoryne truncata and D. profunda are classified into the R-G pattern, whereas D. muelleri was grouped into the R&D pattern, indicating that the difference in the photosynthetic association may be closely related to the dwelling depth. The Q-mode cluster analysis showed that the 30 stations were classified into four clusters: A1, A2, B, and C. The geographical distributions of the four cluster groups are consistent with the climate zone and water masses, suggesting that the species composition of these shallow taxa is influenced by the distribution of water masses. In particular, the Kuroshio Current may play an important role in the migration of shallow living radiolarian species from the subtropical climatic zone to the subarctic climatic zone.","2018","139","10.1016/j.marmicro.2017.10.007","me","not yet"

We used P. biaurelia (one of the 15 cryptic species of the P. aurelia complex) collected worldwide from 92 sampling points over 62 years and analyzed with the three above mentioned approaches as a model for testing protistan biogeography hypotheses. Our results indicated that despite the large distance between them, most of the studied populations of P. biaurelia do not differ from each other (rDNA fragment), or differ only slightly (COI mtDNA fragment). These results could suggest that in the past, the predecessors of the present P. biaurelia population experienced a bottleneck event, and that its current distribution is the result of recent dispersal by natural or anthropogenic factors. Another possible explanation for the low level of genetic diversity despite the huge distances between the collecting sites could be a slow rate of mutation of the studied DNA fragments, as has been found in some other species of the P. aurelia complex. COI haplotypes determined from samples obtained during field research conducted in 2015-2016 in 28 locations/374 sampling points in southern Poland were shared with other, often distant P. biaurelia populations.

The SAR202 cluster belonging to the phylum Chloroflexi was the first microbial lineage discovered to specifically inhabit the aphotic realm, where they are abundant and globally distributed. The absence of SAR202 cultured representatives is a significant bottleneck towards understanding their metabolic capacities and role in the marine environment. In this work, we use a combination of metagenome-assembled genomes from deep-sea datasets and publicly available single-cell genomes to construct a genomic perspective of SAR202 phylogeny, metabolism and biogeography. Our results suggest that SAR202 cluster members are medium sized, free-living cells with a heterotrophic lifestyle, broadly divided into two distinct clades. We present the first evidence of vertical stratification of these microbes along the meso- and bathypelagic ocean layers. Remarkably, two distinct species of SAR202 cluster are highly abundant in nearly all deep bathypelagic metagenomic datasets available so far. SAR202 members metabolize multiple organosulfur compounds, many appear to be sulfite-oxidizers and are predicted to play a major role in sulfur turnover in the dark water column. This concomitantly suggests an unsuspected availability of these nutrient sources to allow for the high abundance of these microbes in the deep sea.","2018","12","10.1038/s41396-017-0009-5","me","not yet"

"Spiesman, BJ; Stapper, AP; Inouye, BD","Patch size, isolation, and matrix effects on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in a landscape microcosm","ECOSPHERE","The amount and arrangement of habitat is a fundamental determinant of biodiversity and ecosystem processes in a landscape. Biodiversity is expected to decline following habitat loss and isolation, potentially impeding ecosystem function. But because greater isolation usually accompanies habitat loss, the effects of habitat amount and isolation can be confounded. Moreover, the type or quality of the intervening matrix habitat can mediate amount and isolation effects on biodiversity. We used a landscape microcosm of oak leaf litter patches to examine the responses of bacterial communities and the ecosystem function of oak leaf decomposition to patch size, degree of isolation, and matrix habitat type (pine litter or bare ground). We found that oak patch size had no significant effect on bacterial communities or decomposition rates. However, bacterial richness increased with greater patch isolation and when oak litter patches were surrounded by a matrix of pine litter, rather than bare ground. The benefit of patch isolation for biodiversity runs counter to that expected by island biogeography theory, suggesting that spatially dependent interspecific interactions, such as predation or competition, may override direct dispersal effects. Higher bacterial richness in oak litter patches surrounded by a pine litter matrix indicated that spillover from neighboring matrix habitat can increase local richness. Instead of greater bacterial richness enhancing ecosystem functioning, leaf litter decomposition was negatively correlated with bacterial richness: Decomposition was slower in isolated oak litter patches and patches surrounded by a pine litter matrix. This negative relationship may be a result of spatial dynamics that can promote the persistence of bacteria from pine litter habitats that are not well suited to oak litter decomposition. Overall, our experiment indicates that effects of habitat loss, isolation, and matrix quality on richness and composition may depend on spatially constrained interspecific interactions, which can determine the functional ability of communities.","2018","9","10.1002/ecs2.2173","me","not yet"

The results showed that the fungal community was dominated by Sordariomycetes, Leotiomycetes, Dothideomycetes, Pezizomycetes and Agaricomycetes. The results revealed that altitude, mean annual temperature, C/N ration, dissolve organic carbon and total nitrogen were the best predictors for shaping fungal community structure in these lakes. Significant spatial and environmental distance decay relationships in the fungal community were detected. The partial Mantel test indicated that the fungal community structure was significantly correlated with environmental distance but not with geographic distance.

By contrast, little is known about the composition and diversity of the bacterial community in the sediments (bacteriobenthos) at the freshwater-seawater transition (mesohaline conditions). In this study, partial 16S-rRNA sequences were used to investigate the bacterial community at five stations, representing almost freshwater (oligohaline) to marine conditions, in the Baltic Sea. Samples were obtained from the silty, top-layer (0-2.5 cm) sediments with mostly oxygenated conditions. The long water residence time characteristic of the Baltic Sea, was predicted to enable the development of autochthonous bacteriobenthos at mesohaline conditions. Our results showed that, similar to the water column, salinity is a major factor in structuring the bacteriobenthos and that there is no loss of bacterial richness at intermediate salinities. The bacterial communities of marine, mesohaline, and oligohaline sediments differed in terms of the relative rRNA abundances of the major bacterial phyla/classes. At mesohaline conditions typical marine and oligohaline operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were abundant. Putative unique OTUs in mesohaline sediments were present only at low abundances, suggesting that the mesohaline environment consists mainly of marine and oligohaline bacteria with a broad salinity tolerance.

Furthermore, our data suggest that this gradient is attenuated in individuals with low salivary flow due to Sjogrens syndrome.

Ammonia-oxidizing microbes play an important role in N cycling in the black soils. However, the information related to the composition and distribution of ammonia-oxidizing microbes in the black soils has not yet been addressed. In this study, we used the amoA gene to quantify the abundance and community composition of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) across the black soil zone. The amoA abundance of AOA was remarkably larger than that of AOB, with ratios of AOA/AOB in the range from 3.1 to 91.0 across all soil samples. The abundance of AOA amoA was positively correlated with total soil C content (p < 0.001) but not with soil pH (p > 0.05). In contrast, the abundance of AOB amoA positively correlated with soil pH (p = 0.009) but not with total soil C. Alpha diversity of AOA did not correlate with any soil parameter, however, alpha diversity of AOB was affected by multiple soil factors, such as soil pH, total P, N, and C, available K content, and soil water content. Canonical correspondence analysis indicated that the AOA community was mainly affected by the sampling latitude, followed by soil pH, total P and C; while the AOB community was mainly determined by soil pH, as well as total P, C and N, water content, and sampling latitude, which highlighted that the AOA community was more geographically distributed in the black soil zone of northeast China than AOB community. In addition, the pairwise analyses showed that the potential nitrification rate (PNR) was not correlated with alpha diversity but weakly positively with the abundance of the AOA community (p = 0.048), whereas PNR significantly correlated positively with the richness (p = 0.003), diversity (p = 0.001) and abundance (p < 0.001) of the AOB community, which suggested that AOB community might make a greater contribution to nitrification than AOA community in the black soils when ammonium is readily available.","2018","9","10.3389/fmicb.2018.00171","me","not yet"

It harbors both submarine and intertidal active sites, discharging hydrogen-and methane-rich alkaline fluids of low salinity and mild temperature through porous carbonate edifices. In this study, we have extensively investigated the bacterial and archaeal communities inhabiting the hydrothermal chimneys from one intertidal and three submarine sites by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. We show that the bacterial community of the intertidal site is clearly distinct from that of the submarine sites with species distribution patterns driven by only a few abundant populations, affiliated to the Chloroflexi and Proteobacteria phyla. In contrast, the distribution of archaeal taxa seems less sitedependent, as exemplified by the co-occurrence, in both submarine and intertidal sites, of two dominant phylotypes of Methanosarcinales previously thought to be restricted to serpentinizing systems, either marine (Lost City Hydrothermal Field) or terrestrial (The Cedars ultrabasic springs). Over 70% of the phylotypes were rare and included, among others, all those affiliated to candidate divisions. We finally compared the distribution of bacterial and archaeal phylotypes of Prony Hydrothermal Field with those of five previously studied serpentinizing systems of geographically distant sites. Although sensu stricto no core microbial community was identified, a few uncultivated lineages, notably within the archaeal order Methanosarcinales and the bacterial class Dehalococcoidia (the candidate division MSBL5) were exclusively found in a few serpentinizing systems while other operational taxonomic units belonging to the orders Clostridiales, Thermoanaerobacterales, or the genus Hydrogenophaga, were abundantly distributed in several sites. These lineages may represent taxonomic signatures of serpentinizing ecosystems. These findings extend our current knowledge of the microbial diversity inhabiting serpentinizing systems and their biogeography.","2018","9","10.3389/fmicb.2018.00102","me","not yet"

Here, we investigated the influence of spatial scale on the relative role of stochasticity and determinism in agricultural monocultures consisting only of wheat, thereby minimizing the influence of differences in plant species cover and in cultivation/disturbance regime, extending across a wide range of soils and climates of the North China Plain (NCP). We sampled 243 sites across 1092 km and sequenced the 16S rRNA bacterial gene using MiSeq. We hypothesized that determinism would play a relatively stronger role at the broadest scales, due to the strong influence of climate and soil differences in selecting many distinct OTUs of bacteria adapted to the different environments. In order to test the more general applicability of the hypothesis, we also compared with a natural ecosystem on the Tibetan Plateau. Results: Our results revealed that the relative importance of stochasticity vs. determinism did vary with spatial scale, in the direction predicted. On the North China Plain, stochasticity played a dominant role from 150 to 900 km (separation between pairs of sites) and determinism dominated at more than 900 km (broad scale). On the Tibetan Plateau, determinism played a dominant role from 130 to 1200 km and stochasticity dominated at less than 130 km. Among the identifiable deterministic factors, soil pH showed the strongest influence on soil bacterial community structure and diversity across the North China Plain. Together, 23.9% of variation in soil microbial community composition could be explained, with environmental factors accounting for 19.7% and spatial parameters 4.1%. Conclusions: Our findings revealed that (1) stochastic processes are relatively more important on the North China Plain, while deterministic processes are more important on the Tibetan Plateau; (2) soil pH was the major factor in shaping soil bacterial community structure of the North China Plain; and (3) most variation in soil microbial community composition could not be explained with existing environmental and spatial factors. Further studies are needed to dissect the influence of stochastic factors (e.g., mutations or extinctions) on soil microbial community distribution, which might make it easier to predictably manipulate the microbial community to produce better yield and soil sustainability outcomes.","2018","6","10.1186/s40168-018-0409-4","me","not yet"
"Besnard, G; Terral, JF; Cornille, A","On the origins and domestication of the olive: a review and perspectives","ANNALS OF BOTANY","Background Unravelling domestication processes is crucial for understanding how species respond to anthropogenic pressures, forecasting crop responses to future global changes and improving breeding programmes. Domestication processes for clonally propagated perennials differ markedly from those for seed-propagated annual crops, mostly due to long generation times, clonal propagation and recurrent admixture with local forms, leading to a limited number of generations of selection from wild ancestors. However, additional case studies are required to document this process more fully. Scope The olive is an iconic species in Mediterranean cultural history. Its multiple uses and omnipresence in traditional agrosystems have made this species an economic pillar and cornerstone of Mediterranean agriculture. However, major questions about the domestication history of the olive remain unanswered. New paleobotanical, archeological, historical and molecular data have recently accumulated for olive, making it timely to carry out a critical re-evaluation of the biogeography of wild olives and the history of their cultivation. We review here the chronological history of wild olives and discuss the questions that remain unanswered, or even unasked, about their domestication history in the Mediterranean Basin. We argue that more detailed ecological genomics studies of wild and cultivated olives are crucial to improve our understanding of olive domestication. Multidisciplinary research integrating genomics, metagenomics and community ecology will make it possible to decipher the evolutionary ecology of one of the most iconic domesticated fruit trees worldwide. Conclusion The olive is a relevant model for improving our knowledge of domestication processes in clonally propagated perennial crops, particularly those of the Mediterranean Basin. Future studies on the ecological and genomic shifts linked to domestication in olive and its associated community will provide insight into the phenotypic and molecular bases of crop adaptation to human uses.","2018","121","10.1093/aob/mcx145","me","not yet"

Thus, as older taxa have produced more individuals over time, and smaller taxa have higher population sizes and faster generation times, the Latitudinal Diversity Gradients (LDGs) of these clades should show shallower slopes. We describe the LDGs for archaea, bacteria, fungi, invertebrates and trees from six North American forests. For three focal groups - bacteria, ants, and trees older taxa had shallower LDG slopes than the more recent, terminal taxa. Across 12 orders of magnitude of body mass, LDG slopes were steeper in larger taxa. The slopes of LDGs vary systematically with body size and clade age, underscoring the non-canonical nature of LDGs. The steepest LDG slopes were found for the largest organisms while the smallest, from bacteria to small litter-soil invertebrates, have shallower-to zero-slope LDGs. If tropical niche conservatism is the failure of clades to adapt to, and diversify in temperate habitats, then the steep LDGs of chordates and plants likely arise from the decreased ability of clades with large individuals to adapt to the multiple challenges of extra-tropical life.","2018","41","10.1111/ecog.02314","me","not yet"

To address this deficit, we collected eight samples to unveil the bacterial and archaeal community in the Kaidu river, located at the arid region of northwestern China (an average of 2,500 m a.s.l.). For the bacterial community, phylogenetically Betaproteobacteria prevailed, followed by Alphaproteobacteria and Actinobacteria; at the finer genus level, Limnohabitans and Variovorax were prominent. Along the river, the bacterial community showed a continuous succession. Specifically, their alpha- and beta-diversity gradually increased, suggesting a distance-decay pattern. Additionally, there was an ecological transition between the dominant and the rare sub-community along the river: the relative abundance of the dominant members gradually decreased as the rare members increased. We report that temperature and spatial distance were significantly related to the variation of bacterial community. Variance partitioning analysis showed that the environmental factors contributed more to the bacterial community than did the spatial distance. In the case of the archaeal community, the methanogenic groups, mainly Methanosaeta and Methanosarcina, were prominent within the Kaidu river. Unlike the continuous change in the patterns of the bacterial community, the archaeal community showed a constant pattern along the river. Our results showed that the archaeal community was independent of the environmental and spatial factors. We propose that the inoculation of soil-derived archaea is responsible for the archaeal community in the Kaidu river. Together, our study demonstrated that the bacterial community in the high-elevation Kaidu river is a continuum, whereas the archaeal community is not.","2018","56","10.1007/s12275-018-7244-y","me","not yet"

These microaggregates are composed of diverse mineral, organic and biotic materials that are bound together during pedogenesis by various physical, chemical and biological processes. Consequently, microaggregates can withstand strong mechanical and physicochemical stresses and survive slaking in water, allowing them to persist in soils for several decades. Together with the physiochemical heterogeneity of their surfaces, the three-dimensional structure of microaggregates provides a large variety of ecological niches that contribute to the vast biological diversity found in soils. As reported for larger aggregate units, microaggregates are composed of smaller building units that become more complex with increasing size. In this context, organo-mineral associations can be considered structural units of soil aggregates and as nanoparticulate fractions of the microaggregates themselves. The mineral phases considered to be the most important as microaggregate forming materials are the clay minerals and Fe- and Al-(hydr)oxides. Within microaggregates, minerals are bound together primarily by physicochemical and chemical interactions involving cementing and gluing agents. The former comprise, among others, carbonates and the short-range ordered phases of Fe, Mn, and Al. The latter comprise organic materials of diverse origin and probably involve macromolecules and macromolecular mixtures. Work on microaggregate structure and development has largely focused on organic matter stability and turnover. However, little is known concerning the role microaggregates play in the fate of elements like Si, Fe, Al, P, and S. More recently, the role of microaggregates in the formation of microhabitats and the biogeography and diversity of microbial communities has been investigated. Little is known regarding how microaggregates and their properties change in time, which strongly limits our understanding of micro-scale soil structure dynamics. Similarly, only limited information is available on the mechanical stability of microaggregates, while essentially nothing is known about the flow and transport of fluids and solutes within the micro- and nanoporous microaggregate systems. Any quantitative approaches being developed for the modeling of formation, structure and properties of microaggregates are, therefore, in their infancy. We respond to the growing awareness of the importance of microaggregates for the structure, properties and functions of soils by reviewing what is currently known about the formation, composition and turnover of microaggregates. We aim to provide a better understanding of their role in soil function, and to present the major unknowns in current microaggregate research. We propose a harmonized concept for aggregates in soils that explicitly considers the structure and build-up of microaggregates and the role of organo-mineral associations. We call for experiments, studies and modeling endeavors that will link information on aggregate forming materials with their functional properties across a range of scales in order to better understand microaggregate formation and turnover. Finally, we hope to inspire a novel cohort of soil scientists that they might focus their research on improving our understanding of the role of microaggregates within the system of aggregates and so help to develop a unified and quantitative concept of aggregation processes in soils.","2018","181","10.1002/jpln.201600451","me","not yet"

But it remains unclear how the soil properties and geographical distances affect the exoelectrogen communities of Chinese paddy soils. So the objectives of this study were to investigate the diversity and composition of these microbial communities which were enriched on the anodes of soil microbial fuel cells (SMFCs) and to elucidate the links between the microbial community compositions and their driving factors. We used Illumina HiSeq sequencing to determine the bacterial community structures which were enriched on the anodes of SMFCs. Variance partitioning analysis (VPA) was used to obtain the contribution of soil properties and geographical distance to the variations of bacterial communities. Active bacterial community on anodes of the closed circuit SMFCs differs significantly from the control open circuit SMFCs. Anodes of all the closed circuit SMFCs were characterized by the presence of high numbers of Nitrospira and Anaerolineae. Taxonomic similarities and phylogenetic similarities of bacterial communities from different paddy soil samples across North and South China were found to be significantly correlated with geographical distances. The relationship between the similarities and the geographic distance exhibited a distance-decay relationship. VPA showed that both geographical distances and soil properties affect the structure of bacterial communities detected on anodes. Our study gives a foundation for understanding the distribution and diversity of exoelectrogens in paddy soils and elucidates the links between the distribution and the diversity of extracellular respiring bacteria and their driving factors. Furthermore, this study also identifies the crucial factors which should be used to evaluate the response of exoelectrogens to environmental perturbations in Chinese paddy soils.","2018","18","10.1007/s11368-017-1769-2","me","not yet"

However, despite the abundance of sequencing studies, combining data from multiple individual studies to address macroecological questions of bacterial diversity remains methodically challenging and plagued with biases. Here, using a machine-learning approach that accounts for differences among studies and complex interactions among taxa, we merge 30 independent bacterial data sets comprising 1,998 soil samples from 21 countries. Whereas previous meta-analysis efforts have focused on bacterial diversity measures or abundances of major taxa, we show that disparate amplicon sequence data can be combined at the taxonomy-based level to assess bacterial community structure. We find that rarer taxa are more important for structuring soil communities than abundant taxa, and that these rarer taxa are better predictors of community structure than environmental factors, which are often confounded across studies. We conclude that combining data from independent studies can be used to explore bacterial community dynamics, identify potential indicator taxa with an important role in structuring communities, and propose hypotheses on the factors that shape bacterial biogeography that have been overlooked in the past.","2018","3","10.1038/s41564-017-0062-x","me","not yet"

We compared diversity and biogeographical patterns of cultivable and noncultivable root endophytes to assess whether their occurrence is determined by distinct ecological factors. The endophytic diversity in roots of nonmycorrhizal Microthlaspi spp. growing across Europe was assessed using high-throughput sequencing (HTS) and compared with a previous dataset based on cultivation of endophytes from the same root samples. HTS revealed a large fungal richness undetected by cultivation, but which largely comprised taxa with restricted distributions and/or low representation of sequence reads. Both datasets coincided in a consistent high representation of widespread endophytes within orders Pleosporales, Hypocreales and Helotiales, as well as similar associations of community structure with spatial and environmental conditions. Likewise, distributions of particular endophytes inferred by HTS agreed with cultivation data in suggesting individual ecological preferences. Our findings support that Microthlaspi spp. roots are colonized mostly by saprotrophic and likely facultative endophytes, and that differential niche preferences and distribution ranges among fungi importantly drive the assembly of root-endophytic communities.","2018","217","10.1111/nph.14873","me","not yet"

Flagellate genotypes determined from sedimentary DNA deep-sea samples might originate from vital deep-sea populations or from cysts of organisms sedimented down from surface waters. The latter one may have never been active under deep-sea conditions. We wanted to analyze the principal ability of cultivable heterotrophic flagellates of different phylogenetic groups (choanoflagellates, ancyromonads, euglenids, kinetoplastids, bicosoecids, chrysomonads, and cercozoans) to survive exposure to high hydrostatic pressure (up to 670 bar). We summarized our own studies and the few available data from literature on pressure tolerances of flagellates isolated from different marine habitats. Our results demonstrated that many different flagellate species isolated from the surface waters and deep-sea sediments survived drastic changes in hydrostatic pressure. Barophilic behavior was also recorded for several species isolated from the deep sea indicating their possible genetic adaptation to high pressures.

The average bacterioplankton abundances at 5 m, 75 m, and 200 m were 9.55, 5.04, and 1.32 x 10(5) cells mL(-1), respectively, and there was a significantly positive correlation between bacterioplankton abundance and Chl a content (r = 0.84, p < 0.01).

For this study 361 poribacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences obtained by Sanger sequencing from 15 different countries and 8 marine regions were gathered. We could demonstrate that the candidate phylum Poribacteria is composed of diverse phylotypes, which are distributed among a wide range of phylogenetically divergent sponge hosts.

Here, we investigated the community composition and geographical distributions of benthic microeukaryotes using high-throughput sequencing of the 18S rRNA gene and quantified the contributions of environmental factors and spatial separation on the distribution patterns of both rare and abundant taxa. We collected 36 intertidal samples at 12 sandy beaches from four regions that spanned distances from 0.001 to 12,000 km.

Arthropoda and Diatomeae dominated the sequence reads in abundance, but Ciliophora and Discoba were the most diverse groups across all samples. About one-third of the OTUs could not be definitively classified at a similarity level of 80%, supporting the view that a large number of rare and minute marine species may have escaped previous characterization. We found generally similar geographical patterns for abundant and rare microeukaryotic sub-communities, and both showed a significant distance-decay similarity trend. Variation partitioning showed that both rare and abundant sub-communities exhibited a slightly stronger response to environmental factors than spatial (distance) factors. However, the abundant sub-community was strongly correlated with variations in spatial, environmental and sediment grain size factors (66% of variance explained), but the rare assemblage was not (16%).

For photosynthetic groups, V4 and V9 performed equally well to describe global communities at different taxonomic levels from the division to the genus and provided similar Chlorophyta distribution patterns. However, at lower taxonomic level, the V9 dataset failed for example to describe the diversity of Dolichomastigales (Chlorophyta, Mamiellophyceae) emphasizing the lack of V9 sequences for this group and the importance of the reference database for metabarcode analysis.

Here, we formalize the concept of phylogenetic scale, review how phylogenetic scale has been considered across multiple fields and provide practical guidelines for the use of phylogenetic scale to address a range of biological questions. Innovation: We summarize how phylogenetic scale has been treated in macroevolution, community ecology, biogeography and macroecology, illustrating how it can inform, and possibly resolve, some of the longstanding controversies in these fields. To promote the concept empirically, we define phylogenetic grain and extent, scale dependence, scaling and the domains of phylogenetic scale. We illustrate how existing phylogenetic data and statistical tools can be used to investigate the effects of scale on a variety of well-known patterns and processes, including diversification rates, community structure, niche conservatism or species-abundance distributions.

However, little is known about the relative importance of species sorting and dispersal limitation in shaping marine microbial communities; especially, how they are related to organism types/traits and water depth. Here, we used variation partitioning and null model analysis to compare mechanisms driving bacterial and protist metacommunity dynamics at the basin scale in the East China Sea, based on MiSeq paired-end sequencing of 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and 18S rDNA, respectively, in surface, deep chlorophyll maximum and bottom layers. Our analyses indicated that protist communities were governed more strongly by species sorting relative to dispersal limitation than were bacterial communities; this pattern was consistent across the three-depth layers, albeit to different degrees. Furthermore, we detected that bacteria exhibited wider habitat niche breadths than protists, whereas, passive dispersal abilities were not appreciably different between them. Our findings support the size-plasticity hypothesis: smaller organisms (bacteria) are less environment filtered than larger organisms (protists), as smaller organisms are more likely to be plastic in metabolic abilities and have greater environmental tolerance.","2018","12","10.1038/ismej.2017.183","me","not yet"

The draft genome of the isolate encodes all of the enzymatic machinery necessary for both oxygenic and anoxygenic photosynthesis, as well as genes for methylating hopanoids at the C-2 position. The physiological response of the isolate to H2S is complex: (i) no induction time is necessary for anoxygenic photosynthesis; (ii) rates of anoxygenic photosynthesis are regulated by both H2S and irradiance; (iii) O-2 production is inhibited by H2S concentrations as low as 1 mu M and the recovery rate of oxygenic photosynthesis is dependent on irradiance; (iv) under the optimal light conditions for oxygenic photosynthesis, rates of anoxygenic photosynthesis are nearly double those of oxygenic photosynthesis. We hypothesize that the specific adaptation mechanisms of the isolate to H2S emerged from a close spatial interaction with sulfate-reducing bacteria. The new isolate, Leptolyngbya sp. strain hensonii, is not closely related to other well-characterized Cyanobacteria that can perform anoxygenic photosynthesis, which further highlights the need to characterize the diversity and biogeography of metabolically versatile Cyanobacteria. The isolate will be an ideal model organism for exploring the adaptation of Cyanobacteria to sulfidic conditions.","2018","12","10.1038/ismej.2017.193","me","not yet"

However, the extent to which these extracellular genes influence current estimates of prokaryotic biodiversity is unknown. We investigated the abundance and diversity of 16S rDNA sequences contained within extracellular DNA from continental margins of different biogeographic regions. We also compared the taxonomic composition of microbial assemblages through the analysis of extracellular DNA and DNA associated with living cells. 16S rDNA contained in the extracellular DNA pool contributed up to 50% of the total 16S rDNA copy number determined in the sediments. Ca. 4% of extracellular Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) were shared among the different biogeographic regions revealing the presence of a core of preserved OTUs. A higher fraction of OTUs was exclusive of each region potentially due to its geographic and thermohaline characteristics. Ca. one third of the OTUs identified in the extracellular DNA were absent from living prokaryotic assemblages, possibly representing the signatures of past assemblages. Our findings expand the knowledge of the contribution of extracellular microbial sequences to current estimates of prokaryotic diversity obtained through the analyses of environmental DNA, and open new perspectives for understanding microbial successions in benthic ecosystems.","2018","8","10.1038/s41598-018-20302-7","me","not yet"
"Sauze, J; Jones, SP; Wingate, L; Wohl, S; Ogee, J","The role of soil pH on soil carbonic anhydrase activity","BIOGEOSCIENCES","Carbonic anhydrases (CAs) are metalloenzymes present in plants and microorganisms that catalyse the inter-conversion of CO2 and water to bicarbonate and protons. Because oxygen isotopes are also exchanged during this reaction, the presence of CA also modifies the contribution of soil and plant (COO)-O-18 fluxes to the global budget of atmospheric (COO)-O-18. The oxygen isotope signatures (delta O-18) of these fluxes differ as leaf water pools are usually more enriched than soil water pools, and this difference is used to partition the net CO2 flux over land into soil respiration and plant photosynthesis. Nonetheless, the use of atmospheric (COO)-O-18 as a tracer of land surface CO2 fluxes requires a good knowledge of soil CA activity. Previous studies have shown that significant differences in soil CA activity are found in different biomes and seasons, but our understanding of the environmental and ecological drivers responsible for the spatial and temporal patterns observed in soil CA activity is still limited. One factor that has been overlooked so far is pH. Soil pH is known to strongly influence microbial community composition, richness and diversity in addition to governing the speciation of CO2 between the different carbonate forms. In this study we investigated the CO2-H2O isotopic exchange rate (k(iso)) in six soils with pH varying from 4.5 to 8.5. We also artificially increased the soil CA concentration to test how pH and other soil properties (texture and phosphate content) affected the relationship between k(iso) and CA concentration. We found that soil pH was the primary driver of k(iso) after CA addition and that the chemical composition (i.e. phosphate content) played only a secondary role. We also found an offset between the delta O-18 of the water pool with which CO2 equilibrates and total soil water (i.e. water extracted by vacuum distillation) that varied with soil texture. The reasons for this offset are still unknown.","2018","15","10.5194/bg-15-597-2018","me","not yet"

This coastal region provides an ideal model system to study microbial biogeography. The performed high-throughput sequencing to investigate the distribution of bacterial taxa along spatial and environmental gradients. The results showed bacterial communities presented remarkable horizontal and vertical distribution under coastal gradients of spatial and environmental factors. Fourteen abundant taxa clustered the samples into three distinctive groups, reflecting typical habitats in shallow coastal water (seafloor depth <= 20 m), sunlit surface layer (at water surface with seafloor depth >20 m) and bottom water (at 2-3 m above sediment with seafloor depth >20 m), The most significant taxa of each cluster were determined by the least discriminant analysis effect size, and strongly correlated with spatial and environmental variables. Environmental factors (especially turbidity and nitrite) exhibited significant influences on bacterial beta-diversity in surface water (at 0 m sampling depth), while community similarity in bottom water (at 2-3 m above sediment) was mainly determined by depth. In both surface and bottom water, we found bacterial community similarity and the number of OTUs shared between every two sites decreased with increasing geographic distance, Bacterial dispersal was also affected by phosphate, which was possible due to the high ratios of IN/IP in this coastal sea area.","2018","6","10.7717/peerj.4272","me","not yet"

"Delmont, TO; Eren, AM","Linking pangenomes and metagenomes: the Prochlorococcus metapangenome","PEERJ","Pangenomes offer detailed characterizations of core and accessory genes found in a set of closely related microbial genomes, generally by clustering genes based on sequence homology. In comparison, metagenomes facilitate highly resolved investigations of the relative distribution of microbial genomes and individual genes across environments through read recruitment analyses. Combining these complementary approaches can yield unique insights into the functional basis of microbial niche partitioning and fitness, however, advanced software solutions are lacking. Here we present an integrated analysis arid visualization strategy that provides an interactive arid reproducible frame work to generate pangenomes arid to study them in conjunction with metagenomes. To investigate its utility, we applied this strategy to a Prochlorococcus pangenorne in the context of a large-scale marine rnetagenornic survey. The resulting Prochlorococcus metapangenome revealed remarkable differential abundance patterns between very closely related isolates that belonged to the same phylogenetic cluster and that differed by only a small number of gene clusters in the pangenome. While the relationships between these genornes based on gene clusters correlated with their environmental distribution patterns, pylogenetic analyses using marker genes or concatenated single-copy core genes did not recapitulate these patterns. The metapangenome also revealed a small set of core genes that mostly occurred in hypervariable genornic islands of the Prochlorococcus populations, which systematically lacked read recruitment from surface ocean metagenomes. Notably, these core gene clusters were all linked to sugar metabolism, suggesting potential benefits to Prochlorococcus from a high sequence diversity of sugar metabolism genes. The rapidly growing number of microbial genomes and increasing availability of environmental rnetagenomes provide new opportunities to investigate the functioning and the ecology of microbial populations, and metapangenomes can provide unique insights for any taxon and biome for which genomic and sufficiently deep metagenomic data are available.","2018","6","10.7717/peerj.4320","me","not yet"

Corals are known to contain a diverse microbiota that plays a key role in their physiology and health. Here we report the first study that examines the microbiome and pathobiome associated with C. caespitosa in three different Mediterranean locations (i.e., Genova, Columbretes Islands, and Tabarca Island). The microbial communities associated with this species showed biogeographical differences, but shared a common core microbiome that probably plays a key role in the coral holobiont. The putatively pathogenic microbial assemblage (i.e., pathobiome) of C. caespitosa also seemed to depend on geographic location and the human footprint. In locations near the coast and with higher human influence, the pathobiome was entirely constituted by Vibrio species, including the well-known coral pathogens Vibrio coralliilyticus and V. mediterranei. However, in the Columbretes Islands, located off the coast and the most pristine of the analyzed locations, no changes among microbial communities associated to healthy and necrosed samples were detected. Hence, our results provide new insights into the microbiome of the temperate corals and its role in coral health status, highlighting its dependence on the local environmental conditions and the human footprint.","2018","9","10.3389/fmicb.2018.00022","me","not yet"

However, little is presently known about the integrated biogeography of planktonic and sedimentary bacterial communities in large rivers. Results: This study provides the first spatiotemporal pattern of bacterial communities in the Yangtze River, the largest river in Asia with a catchment area of 1,800,000 km(2). We find that sedimentary bacteria made larger contributions than planktonic bacteria to the bacterial diversity of the Yangzte River ecosystem with the sediment subgroup providing 98. 8% of 38,906 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) observed in 280 samples of synchronous flowing water and sediment at 50 national monitoring stations covering a 4300 km reach. OTUs within the same phylum displayed uniform seasonal variations, and many phyla demonstrated autumn preference throughout the length of the river. Seasonal differences in bacterial communities were statistically significant in water, whereas bacterial communities in both water and sediment were geographically clustered according to five types of landforms: mountain, foothill, basin, foothill-mountain, and plain. Interestingly, the presence of two huge dams resulted in a drastic fall of bacterial taxa in sediment immediately downstream due to severe riverbed scouring. The integrity of the biogeography is satisfactorily interpreted by the combination of neutral and species sorting perspectives in meta-community theory for bacterial communities in flowing water and sediment. Conclusions: Our study fills a gap in understanding of bacterial communities in one of the worlds largest river and highlights the importance of both planktonic and sedimentary communities to the integrity of bacterial biogeographic patterns in a river subject to varying natural and anthropogenic impacts.","2018","6","10.1186/s40168-017-0388-x","me","not yet"

A major source of Fe to the open ocean is Aeolian dust deposition in which Fe is largely comprised of particles with reduced bioavailability over soluble forms of Fe. We report that Trichodesmium erythraeum IMS101 has improved growth rate and photosynthetic physiology and down-regulates Fe-stress biomarker genes when cells are grown in the direct vicinity of, rather than physically separated from, Saharan dust particles as the sole source of Fe. These findings suggest that availability of non-soluble forms of dust-associated Fe may depend on cell contact. Transcriptomic analysis further reveals unique profiles of gene expression in all tested conditions, implying that Trichodesmium has distinct molecular signatures related to acquisition of Fe from different sources. Trichodesmium thus appears to be capable of employing specific mechanisms to access Fe from complex sources in oceanic systems, helping to explain its role as a key microbe in global biogeochemical cycles.","2018","8","10.3389/fmicb.2017.02683","me","not yet"

We studied the impact of i) biogeography, ii) agroforestry, and iii) Fusarium wilt (race 1) infestation on the banana-associated gammaproteobacterial microbiome analyzing Gros Michel (AAA genome) grown in Nicaragua and Costa Rica. Additionally, we investigated iv) the microbiome of the East African highland bananas (EAHB, AAA genome) treated with different organic soil amendment combinations of mulch and manure, and v) the microbiome stability of Xanthomonas wilt-resistant transgenic Sukari Ndizi (AAB genome) in Uganda. Overall, the gammaproteobacterial banana microbiome was dominated by Pseudomonadales, Enterobacteriales and Xanthomonadales. An extraordinary high diversity of gammaproteobacterial microbiota was observed within the endophytic microenvironments, endorhiza and pseudostem. Enterobacteria were identified as a highly dominant group in aerial plant parts, especially of the pseudostem and leaves. Our studies show that the gammaproteobacterial banana microbiome is influenced by biogeography and banana cultivar. Work also corroborates findings that agroforestry leads to increased plant health via shifts within the microbiome. In this light, a sophisticated design of manipulating plant microbiomes can help us reduce pesticide and fertilizer use. Using gammaproteobacterial health indicators can help preventing Fusarium wilt infestation. Organic management practices lead to increased microbial soil diversity. Further studies based on more holistic population microbiology are necessary to potentially extend this behavior to the entire microbial community. Our risk assessment shows a stable microbiome for Xanthomonas wilt-resistant transgenic bananas with no consequences for non-target rhizobacteria, although additional studies should address the microbiome stability over a longer time frame.","2018","1196","10.17660/ActaHortic.2018.1196.1","me","not yet"

In Sub-Saharan Africa, the diversity and biogeographic distribution of bacterial microsymbionts nodulating cowpea and other indigenous legumes are not well understood, though needed for increased legume production. The aim of this study was to describe the distribution and phylogenies of rhizobia at different agroecological regions of Mozambique using PCR of the BOX element (BOX-PCR), restriction fragment length polymorphism of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS-RFLP), and sequence analysis of ribosomal, symbiotic, and housekeeping genes. A total of 122 microsymbionts isolated from two cowpea varieties (IT-1263 and IT-18) grouped into 17 clades within the BOX-PCR dendrogram. The PCR-ITS analysis yielded 17 ITS types for the bacterial isolates, while ITS-RFLP analysis placed all test isolates in six distinct clusters (I to VI). BLASTn sequence analysis of 16S rRNA and four housekeeping genes (glnII, gyrB, recA, and rpoB) showed their alignment with Rhizobium and Bradyrhizobium species. The results revealed a group of highly diverse and adapted cowpea-nodulating microsymbionts which included Bradyrhizobium pachyrhizi, Bradyrhizobium arachidis, Bradyrhizobium yuanmingense, and a novel Bradyrhizobium sp., as well as Rhizobium tropici, Rhizobium pusense, and Neorhizobium galegae in Mozambican soils. Discordances observed in single-gene phylogenies could be attributed to horizontal gene transfer and/or subsequent recombinations of the genes. Natural deletion of 60 bp of the gyrB region was observed in isolate TUTVU7; however, this deletion effect on DNA gyrase function still needs to be confirmed. The inconsistency of nifH with core gene phylogenies suggested differences in the evolutionary history of both chromosomal and symbiotic genes.

However, the distribution of plant species and soils are highly variable even within a tropical region. This paper reviews existing and novel knowledge on soil genesis, plant and microbial physiology, and biogeochemistry. Typically, forests in Southeast Asia are dominated by dipterocarps growing on acidic Ultisols from relatively young parent material. In the Neotropics and Africa, forests contain abundant legume trees growing on Oxisols developed in the older parent materials on stable continental shields. In Southeast Asia, the removal of base cations from the surface soil due to leaching and uptake by dipterocarp trees result in intensive acidification and accumulation of exchangeable Al3+, which is toxic to most plants. Nutrient mining by ectomycorrhizal fungi and efficient allocation within tree organs can supply phosphorus (P) for reproduction (e.g., mast fruiting) even on P-limited soils. In the Neotropics and Africa, nitrogen (N) fixation by legume trees can ameliorate N or P limitation but excess N can promote acidification through nitrification. Biological weathering [e.g., plant silicon (Si) cycling] and leaching can lead to loss of Si from soil. The resulting accumulation of Al and Fe oxides in Oxisols that can reduce P solubility through sorption and lead to limitation of P relative to N. Thus, geographical variation in geology and plant species drives patterns of soil weathering and niche differentiation at the global scale in tropical forests.","2018","33","10.1007/s11284-017-1511-y","me","not yet"

One such example is the production of metal-detoxifying siderophores. Here, we investigate whether conflicting selection pressures on siderophore production by heavy metals - a detoxifying effect of siderophores, and exploitation of this detoxifying effect - result in a net increase or decrease. We show that the proportion of siderophore-producing taxa increases along a natural heavy metal gradient. A causal link between metal contamination and siderophore production was subsequently demonstrated in a microcosm experiment in compost, in which we observed changes in community composition towards taxa that produce relatively more siderophores following copper contamination. We confirmed the selective benefit of siderophores by showing that taxa producing large amounts of siderophore suffered less growth inhibition in toxic copper. Our results suggest that ecological selection will favour siderophore-mediated decontamination, with important consequences for potential remediation strategies.","2018","21","10.1111/ele.12878","me","not yet"

Despite the crucial ecological role of bacteria, our understanding of their large-scale biogeography patterns across forests, and the processes that determine these patterns lags significantly behind that of macroorganisms. Here, we evaluated the geographic distributions of bacterial diversity and their driving factors across nine latitudinal forests along a 3,700-km north-south transect in eastern China, using high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Four of 32 phyla detected were dominant: Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria and Chloroflexi (relative abundance>5%). Significant increases in bacterial richness and phylogenetic diversity were observed for temperate forests compared with subtropical or tropical forests. The soil organic matter (SOM) mineralisation rate (SOMmin, an index of SOM availability) explained the largest significant variations in bacterial richness. Variation partition analysis revealed that the bacterial community structure was closely correlated with environmental variables and geographic distance, which together explained 80.5% of community variation. Among all environmental factors, climatic features (MAT and MAP) were the best predictors of the bacterial community structure, whereas soil pH and SOMmin emerged as the most important edaphic drivers of the bacterial community structure. Plant functional traits (community weighted means of litter N content) and diversity resulted in weak but significant correlations with the bacterial community structure.

Empirical studies have documented this pattern across many different organisms and locations. Our goal was to quantify the evidence for the global LDG and the associated spatial, taxonomic and environmental factors. We performed a meta-analysis on a large number of individual LDGs that have been published in the 14 years since Hillebrands ground-breaking meta-analysis of the LDG, using meta-analysis and metaregression approaches largely new to the fields of ecology and biogeography. Location: Global. Time period: January 2003-September 2015. Major taxa studied: Bacteria, protists, plants, fungi and animals. Methods: We synthesized the outcomes of 389 individual cases of LDGs from 199 papers published since 2003, using hierarchical mixed-effects meta-analysis and multiple meta-regression. Additionally, we re-analysed Hillebrands original dataset using modern methods. Results: We confirmed the generality of the LDG, but found the pattern to be weaker than was found in Hillebrands study. We identified previously unreported variation in LDG strength and slope across longitude, with evidence that the LDG is strongest in the Western Hemisphere. Locational characteristics, such as habitat and latitude range, contributed significantly to LDG strength, whereas organismal characteristics, including taxonomic group and trophic level, did not. Modern meta-analytical models that incorporate hierarchical structure led to more conservative and sometimes contrasting effect size estimates relative to Hillebrands initial analysis, whereas metaregression revealed underlying patterns in Hillebrands dataset that were not apparent with a traditional analysis. Main conclusions: We present evidence of global latitudinal, longitudinal and habitat-based patterns in the LDG, which are apparent across both marine and terrestrial realms and over a broad taxonomic range of organisms, from bacteria to plants and vertebrates.","2018","27","10.1111/geb.12665","me","not yet"

Here, we investigated spatial variations of fungal communities across three different types of temperate grasslands along a transect in the Inner Mongolia, China. The aims were to understand the biogeographic patterns of fungi and key drivers shaping soil fungal communities in temperate grasslands. The composition and diversity of soil fungal community across 30 sites of the meadow steppe, typical steppe, and desert steppe along a 1200-km transect were studied through pyrosequencing. The relationships between fungal communities and environmental and biotic factors were assessed. The results showed that the fungal community along this transect exhibited strong dependence on soil moisture content and nitrate concentration, while the fungal alpha diversity was positively correlated with precipitation and below-ground biomass. Drier environment has resulted in a shift towards an Ascomycota-dominating fungal community. Our findings suggest that the distribution and community structure of soil fungal communities are primarily driven by precipitation. Plant biomass and soil nutrient status which are also influenced by precipitation are also predictors of fungal community. Our results provide important implications for understanding the linkages among environmental factors and soil fungal communities in Eurasian steppe ecosystems.","2018","18","10.1007/s11368-017-1727-z","me","not yet"
"Versluys, M; Kirtel, O; Oner, ET; Van den Ende, W","The fructan syndrome: Evolutionary aspects and common themes among plants and microbes","PLANT CELL AND ENVIRONMENT","Fructans are multifunctional fructose-based water soluble carbohydrates found in all biological kingdoms but not in animals. Most research has focused on plant and microbial fructans and has received a growing interest because of their practical applications. Nevertheless, the origin of fructan production, the so-called fructan syndrome, is still unknown. Why fructans only occur in a limited number of plant and microbial species remains unclear. In this review, we provide an overview of plant and microbial fructan research with a focus on fructans as an adaptation to the environment and their role in (a)biotic stress tolerance. The taxonomical and biogeographical distribution of fructans in both kingdoms is discussed and linked (where possible) to environmental factors. Overall, the fructan syndrome may be related to water scarcity and differences in physicochemical properties, for instance, water retaining characteristics, at least partially explain why different fructan types with different branching levels are found in different species. Although a close correlation between environmental stresses and fructan production is quite clear in plants, this link seems to be missing in microbes. We hypothesize that this can be at least partially explained by differential evolutionary timeframes for plants and microbes, combined with potential redundancy effects. The capacity to biosynthesize fructans, fructose-based oligo and polysaccharides, is scattered over certain plant and microbial families. This review represents the first attempt to grasp the overall meaning of the fructan syndrome, crossing plants and microbes. By highlighting functional similarities and differences, this review prepares the ground for further research in plants and microbes, with focus on water scarcity and fructan signalling as common themes.","2018","41","10.1111/pce.13070","me","not yet"

To better understand the relationship between the lung microbiome and early respiratory disease, we characterized the lower airways microbiome using bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples obtained from clinically stable CF infants and preschoolers who underwent bronchoscopy and chest computed tomography (CT). Cross-sectional samples suggested a progression of the lower airways microbiome with age, beginning with relatively sterile airways in infancy. By age two, bacterial sequences typically associated with the oral cavity dominated lower airways samples in many CF subjects. The presence of an oral-like lower airways microbiome correlated with a significant increase in bacterial density and inflammation. These early changes occurred in many patients, despite the use of antibiotic prophylaxis in our cohort during the first two years of life. The majority of CF subjects older than four harbored a pathogen dominated airway microbiome, which was associated with a further increase in inflammation and the onset of structural lung disease, despite a negligible increase in bacterial density compared to younger patients with an oral-like airway microbiome. Our findings suggest that changes within the CF lower airways microbiome occur during the first years of life and that distinct microbial signatures are associated with the progression of early CF lung disease.","2018","14","10.1371/journal.ppat.1006798","me","not yet"

Fourteen bacterial species were identified and their phylogenetic relationships were analysed by constructing a neighbour-joining tree with Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis 6. The identified species encompassed four bacterial classes that were Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria known to have been associated with sponges. The potential biotechnological applications of the identified bacteria were compared and reviewed based on relevant past studies. The biotechnological functions of the 14 cultivable isolates have been previously reported, hence reinforcing that bacteria associated with sponges are an abundant resource of scientifically essential compounds.

These topics were identified because of the substantial attention given to them during the course of the last half century, and due to their potential importance in issues of local and global expanse, such as: aquatic and terrestrial stability of habitats, ecosystem processes, biogeochemistry and climate change, and the role of eukaryotic microbes generally in ecosystem services. Moreover, there are close epistemological and thematic ties among the three topics, making a synthesis of the published research more systematic and productive. The number of reviewed publications for each of the three individual topics is presented to illustrate the trends in publication frequencies during the historical period of analysis. Overall, the number of total publications reviewed varied somewhat between 1965 and early 2000 (generally less than 10 per year), but increased to well over 10 per year after 2000. The number of Biogeography and Ecology studies identified in the online citations increased substantially after the mid 1990s, while studies focusing on Physiology were relatively more abundant in the first decade (1965-1974) and less were identified in the 1985 to 2004 period. Citations to the literature are listed in tables for each of the three topics for convenience in retrieving references to specific aspects, and representative examples of the cited research in the tables are reviewed in the text under subheads dedicated to each of the three topics. Biogeographic studies largely focused on the geographic distribution and localized patterns of occurrence of amoebae, with more recent studies incorporating more attention to likely correlates with environmental and biotic factors in the distribution and community composition of amoebae. Ecological studies reviewed in the later decades tended to focus more on community dynamics, the effects of environmental variables on communities (including climate-related topics), a trend toward more physiological ecology studies, combined field-based and experimental studies, and incorporation of newer methodologies such as molecular genetics. In general, physiology studies in the first decades of the review tended to focus on topics of cell physiology such as basic biochemistry, enzyme assays, mechanisms of cell division and development, encystment, and motility. Later studies examined broader topics such as osmoregulation, nutrition, fine structure evidence of cellular changes during the life cycle (including encystment and excystment), and issues related to asexual and sexual reproduction, with increasing substantial evidence of evolutionary patterns and phylogenetics based on molecular evidence. A final section on Conclusions and Recommendations summarizes the findings and presents some potentially productive approaches to future research studies on Amoebozoa within the three designated topics of analysis.","2018","57","10.4467/16890027AP.18.001.8395","me","not yet"

However, the overall impact of FTs on soil bacterial communities, especially in temperate regions, remains unclear. In this study, soil samples were collected from a midtemperate region in the northeast of China, and three incubation tests were then designed with varied FT amplitudes (i.e., at a freezing temperature of -15, -9, and -3 degrees C, respectively), frequencies of FT cycles (i.e., under one, six, and 15 FT cycles, respectively) and soil water content (SWC) values (i.e., at 10 and 30% SWC, respectively). High-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons was performed and the functional profile was further predicted based on these data, in addition to examinations of bulk microbial properties. Data analyses suggested that, first of all, the FT amplitude significantly influenced the bulk microbial properties and bacterial community (composition and function); certain taxa showed a nonlinear response to the three amplitudes. Next, compared to a single FTC, multiple FT cycles had only minor effects on the bacterial functional capabilities, although the bulk microbial properties changed significantly after multiple FT cycles. In addition, the bacterial response to FTs was influenced by the SWC, characterized by the significantly different bacterial community structures (composition and function) and the opposite trends of enzyme activities. Finally, RDA plots and a correlation network assembled data from all soil samples across the three tests and suggested that bacterial response trajectories changed because some species were influenced mainly by other species (i.e., biotic environment) during FT processes.","2018",NA,"10.1155/2018/8412429","me","not yet"

QIIME analysis of 16S rDNA of bacterial associates of major fauna from 1995 to 2015 was thus undertaken to examine phylogeography of their microbial symbionts along with host specificity. While phylotypes were generally unrelated, bivalve Calyptogena exhibited vertical transmission sharing similar symbionts in geographically separated geosystems. Different species of tubeworms possessed identical symbionts through horizontal acquisition at geographically distinct Guaymas basin vent and the Arctic seep. Vents were more versatile with both mobile and sessile fauna hosting ecto- and endo-symbionts. Comparatively, seeps were more specialized with sessile animal hosts with endosymbionts. C-fixation rate measurements are still scanty for sediments, bedrocks and serpentine systems; vent, seep, anoxic and oxic basins were shown to fix up to 22, 325, 96, and 37,400g C m(-3) y(-1), respectively.

Among them, two at high altitudes are known to contain ice year-round: Mauna Loa Icecave (MLIC) and the Arsia Cave. These unusual caves harbor cold, humid, dark, and biologically restricted environments. Secondary minerals and ice were sampled from both caves to explore their geochemical and microbiological characteristics. The minerals sampled from the deep parts of the caves, where near freezing temperatures prevail, are all multi-phase and consist mainly of secondary amorphous silica SiO2, cryptocrystalline calcite CaCO3, and gypsum CaSO4 center dot 2H(2)O. Based on carbon and oxygen stable isotope ratios, all sampled calcite is cryogenic. The isotopic composition of falls on the global meteoric line, indicating that little evaporation has occurred. The microbial diversity of a silica and calcite deposit in the MLIC and from ice pond water in the Arsia Cave was explored by analysis of similar to 50,000 small subunit ribosomal RNA gene fragments via amplicon sequencing. Analyses reveal that the Hawaiian ice caves harbor unique microbial diversity distinct from other environments, including cave environments, in Hawaii and worldwide. Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria were the most abundant microbial phyla detected, which is largely consistent with studies of other oligotrophic cave environments. The cold, isolated, oligotrophic basaltic lava cave environment in Hawaii provides a unique opportunity to understand microbial biogeography not only on Earth but also on other planets.","2018","35","10.1080/01490451.2017.1362079","me","not yet"

The East China Sea (ECS) is a complex and dynamic habitat with different water masses blending microbial communities. The internal transcribed spacer 2 region of fungal rDNA was analysed in water and sediment samples directly collected from the coastal (CWM), Kuroshio (KSWM), Taiwan warm (TWM) and the shelf mixed water mass (MWM), coupled with hydrographic properties measurements, to determine how ocean currents impact the fungal community composition. Almost 9k fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) spanning six phyla, 25 known classes, 102 orders and 694 genera were obtained. The typical terrestrial and freshwater fungal genus, Byssochlamys, was dominant in the CWM, while increasing abundance of a specific OTU affiliated with Aspergillus was revealed from coastal to open ocean water masses (TWM and KSWM). Compared with water samples, sediment harboured an increased diversity with distinct fungal communities. The proximity of the Yangtze and Qiantang estuaries homogenizes the surface water and sediment communities. A significant influence of ocean currents on community structure was found, which is believed to reduce proportionally the variation explained by environmental parameters at the scale of the total water masses. Dissolved oxygen and depth were identified as the major parameters structuring the fungal community. Our results indicate that passive fungal dispersal driven by ocean currents and river run-off, in conjunction with the distinct hydrographic conditions of individual water masses, shapes the fungal community composition and distribution pattern in the ECS.","2018","27","10.1111/mec.14440","me","not yet"

Different methodological approaches are currently used; among them are enzyme activities (EA) and CLPP (community level physiological profile) techniques (e.g. MicroResp (TM), MR). The aims of the study were: i) to assess the efficacy of both methods in capturing differences among various land use categories when different levels of selected explanatory variables such as, total organic carbon (TOC) and pH are considered, and ii) to explore, through a quantile regression approach, the possible relationships between each of the two methods with land use category, TOC and pH. The Shannon diversity index (H), calculated from EA and MR data, was chosen as a synthetic index deriving from the same mathematical model. The quantile regression model (QRM), the Kruskal-Wallis and Spearman rank correlation tests were performed. Enzyme activities and MicroResp were reliable ecological indicators to assess soil microbial functional diversity. No correlation was found between the diversity indexes, HEA and HMR; it was therefore supposed that the two methods may target complementary components of microbial functional diversity. Both methods were effective in capturing differences among various land use categories, in particular HMR in soils with low TOC content (< 1.5%). Moreover, the QRM approach allowed a more detailed analysis along the distribution of the diversity indexes (HEA and HMR) indicating that HEA was more dependent on the selected variables.","2018","66","10.1016/j.pedobi.2018.01.001","me","not yet"

In this study we tested whether a group of microscopic animals, the bdelloid rotifers, sampled in a tropical country, could indeed be cosmopolitan, strictly tropical, and/or have endemic species. We sampled freshwater habitats throughout Thailand in dry and rainy seasons between 2014 and 2016, focusing on permanent water bodies, where the prevalence of species producing resting stages acting as propagules for dispersal should be minimal and thus dispersal limitation should exist, with several species being narrowly distributed. We used traditional morphological identification, geometric morphometric analyses on the shape and size of the jaws, and DNA taxonomy to identify species and to quantify the morphological and genetic distances of Thai samples in comparison with data on bdelloids from other areas in the world. We found a total of 12 species of planktonic and periphytic bdelloid rotifers, and all approaches we used, qualitative and quantitative, confirmed a group of nine potentially cosmopolitan species already known from other continents, one tropical oriental species, and two new species with a potentially narrow geographic distribution, one of which we here formally describe. We thus support the idea that for microscopic animals the moderate endemicity hypothesis suggested for protists may also hold true: most of the species we found indeed have a wide geographic distribution, but other species with narrower distributions do exist.http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:3DF5A913-BE6A-4EA4-88FD-C38C0F7AE00A","2018","16","10.1080/14772000.2017.1353554","me","not yet"

Here, we performed dual-index Illumina sequencing of bacterial and archaeal communities on active and inactive sulfide chimneys collected from the Kolumbo hydrothermal field, situated on a geodynamic convergent setting. A total of 15,701 OTUs (operational taxonomic units) were assigned to 56 bacterial and 3 archaeal phyla, 133 bacterial and 16 archaeal classes. Active chimney communities were dominated by OTUs related to thermophilic members of Epsilonproteobacteria, Aquificae and Deltaproteobacteria.

Since fruits are ephemeral, they cannot comprise a permanent microbial habitat; thus, an age-old unanswered question concerns the origin of fruit and ferment associated microbes. Here we use next-generation sequencing approaches to examine and quantify the roles of native forest, vineyard soil, bark and fruit habitats as sources of fungal diversity in ferments. We show that microbial communities in harvested juice and ferments vary significantly across regions, and that while vineyard fungi account for similar to 40% of the source of this diversity, uncultivated ecosystems outside of vineyards also prove a significant source. We also show that while communities in harvested juice resemble those found on grapes, these increasingly resemble fungi present on vine bark as the ferment proceeds.","2018","20","10.1111/1462-2920.13960","me","not yet"

One such habitat transition is the migration from freshwater to saltwater for anadromous fish, such as salmon. The aim of the current work was therefore to determine the freshwater-to-saltwater transition impact on the gut microbiota in farmed Atlantic salmon, with dietary interventions resembling freshwater and saltwater diets with respect to fatty acid composition. Using deep 16S rRNA gene sequencing and quantitative PCR, we found that the freshwater-to-saltwater transition had a major association with the microbiota composition and quantity, while diet did not show significant associations with the microbiota. In saltwater there was a 100-fold increase in bacterial quantity, with a relative increase of Firmicutes and a relative decrease of both Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria. Irrespective of an overall shift in microbiota composition from freshwater to saltwater, we identified three core clostridia and one Lactobacillus-affiliated phylotype with wide geographic distribution that were highly prevalent and co-occurring. Taken together, our results support the importance of the dominating bacteria in the salmon gut, with the freshwater microbiota being immature. Due to the low number of potentially host-associated bacterial species in the salmon gut, we believe that farmed salmon can represent an important model for future understanding of host-bacterium interactions in aquatic environments. IMPORTANCE Little is known about factors affecting the interindividual distribution of gut bacteria in aquatic environments. We have shown that there is a core of four highly prevalent and co-occurring bacteria irrespective of feed and freshwater-to-saltwater transition. The potential host interactions of the core bacteria, however, need to be elucidated further.","2018","84","10.1128/AEM.01974-17","me","not yet"

Gargle, protected bronchial brush, and bronchoalveolar lavage specimens were collected during research bronchoscopies. Bacterial 16S gene sequencing and phylogenetic analysis was performed, and the alterations to the respiratory tract microbiota and changes in microbial biogeography were determined. The microbial structure of the upper and lower respiratory tract was significantly altered in subjects with AUDs compared with controls. Subjects with AUD have greater microbial diversity [P < 0.0001, effect size = 16 +/- 1.7 observed taxa] and changes in microbial species relative abundances. Furthermore, microbial communities in the upper and lower respiratory tract displayed greater similarity in subjects with AUDs. Alcohol use is associated with an altered composition of the respiratory tract microbiota. Subjects with AUDs demonstrate convergence of the microbial phylogeny and taxonomic communities between distinct biogeographical sites within the respiratory tract. These results support a mechanistic pathway potentially explaining the increased incidence of pneumonia and lung diseases in patients with AUDs.","2018","314","10.1152/ajplung.00277.2017","me","not yet"
"He, XP; Chaganti, SR; Heath, DD","Population-Specific Responses to Interspecific Competition in the Gut Microbiota of Two Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar) Populations","MICROBIAL ECOLOGY","The gut microbial community in vertebrates plays a role in nutrient digestion and absorption, development of intestine and immune systems, resistance to infection, regulation of bone mass and even host behavior and can thus impact host fitness. Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) reintroduction efforts into Lake Ontario, Canada, have been unsuccessful, likely due to competition with non-native salmonids. In this study, we explored interspecific competition effects on the gut microbiota of two Atlantic salmon populations (LaHave and Sebago) resulting from four non-native salmonids. After 10 months of rearing in semi-natural stream tanks under six interspecific competition treatments, we characterized the gut microbiota of 178 Atlantic salmon by parallel sequencing the 16S rRNA gene. We found 3978 bacterial OTUs across all samples. Microbiota alpha diversity and abundance of 27 OTUs significantly differed between the two populations. Interspecific competition reduced relative abundance of potential beneficial bacteria (six genera of lactic acid bacteria) as well as 13 OTUs, but only in the LaHave population, indicating population-specific competition effects. The pattern of gut microbiota response to interspecific competition may reflect local adaptation of the host-microbiota interactions and can be used to select candidate populations for improved species reintroduction success.","2018","75","10.1007/s00248-017-1035-6","me","not yet"

This high biodiversity exists in the context of extreme fluctuations in abiotic factors such as temperature, salinity and pH that occur during each tidal cycle. Despite these attributes, few studies have focused on microbial diversity in tide pools, including analyses of the ciliate communities that are the focus of this study. We investigated the spatial and temporal distributions of ciliate species across the intertidal environment at sites in Maine and Connecticut, USA. Our study used a DNA fingerprinting technique, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), which allows for genetic analyses of abundant community members. We investigated how ciliate diversity changed across several spatiotemporal scales: (1) between the open ocean and tide pools, (2) among different tide pools at varying distances from the low tide mark and (3) at differing times within a tidal cycle. In addition, we examined the differences between active and non-active members in these extreme environments by investigating diversity of both ribosomal DNA and RNA. In both Maine and Connecticut, we found abundant ciliate taxa that are either rare or absent in the open ocean, and that appear to quickly dominate tide pools once they are isolated from the open ocean. We also found that ciliate distributions within the tide pool community are complex and variable across spatial and temporal scales.","2018","80","10.3354/ame01839","me","not yet"
"Noronha, MF; Lacerda, GV; Gilbert, JA; de Oliveira, VM","Taxonomic and functional patterns across soil microbial communities of global biomes","SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT","Soil microbial communities have been shown to vary across many spatial scales, yet while variability exists between samples closely located in the same soil, variation between soils of different ecosystems is larger, creating biogeographic trends. Herein, thirty publically-available metagenomes from 11 globally distributed ecosystems were selected. These metagenomes were clustered by biome (i.e. forest, grasslands, tundra, semiarid and desert) based on morphoclimatic features. Protein biosynthesis, central carbohydrate metabolism, and antibiotic resistance were the most statistically different SEED subsystems among biome groups. CAZy-based annotation revealed that genes related to biomass degradation, sucrose and starch metabolism, and cell wall biosynthesis were overrepresented in forest and grasslands soils. As expected, desiccation and other stress resistance genes were prevalent in desert and semiarid soils. Antibiotic Resistance Genes (ARGs) were more abundant in forest and grassland soils, and multidrug efflux pumps were the most abundant ARG class. Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs) were generally more abundant in tundra, semiarid and desert. However, HSP60 and HSP20, predominantly from Archaea, were enriched in the Saline Desert soils. These results suggest that while a core microbiome and functional potential exist in all studied soils, local environmental conditions select for enrichment of specific functions important for survival in a given ecosystem.

We mapped compositional variation (i.e., beta-diversity) in the gut microbiotas of 136 pairs of wild mammalian species living throughout the Americas to assess how the distribution of mammals across geographic space influences the diversification of their gut bacteria. Comparing the gut microbiotas of sympatric and allopatric mammalian populations provided insights into the flow of gut bacteria within and between mammalian communities, revealing that spatial limits on bacterial dispersal promote beta-diversity between the gut microbiotas of mammalian species. Each geographic locale displayed a unique gutmicrobiota composition that could not be fully explained by the diets and phylogenetic histories of the resident mammalian hosts, indicating that some gut bacteria are geographically restricted. Across the western hemisphere, the compositional overlap between the gut microbiotas of allopatric mammalian populations decayed exponentially with the geographic distance separating the hosts. The relationship between geographic distances among hosts and compositional differences among their gut microbiotas was independent of dietary and phylogenetic divergence among hosts. Within mammalian communities, we observed widespread sharing of gut bacteria between predator-prey host-species pairs, indicating horizontal transfer of gut bacteria through mammalian food chains. Collectively, these results indicate that compositional differences between the gut microbiotas of mammalian taxa are generated and maintained by limits to bacterial dispersal imposed by physical distance between hosts.","2017","114","10.1073/pnas.1700122114","me","not yet"

To fill this gap, we conducted a comprehensive study of gut microbiota of a well-studied North American red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) population. Red squirrels are territorial, solitary, and live in a highly seasonal environment and therefore represent a very attractive system to study factors that drive the temporal and spatial dynamics of gut microbiota. Result: For the first time, this study revealed significant spatial patterns of gut microbiota within a host population, suggesting limited dispersal could play a role in shaping and maintaining the structure of gut microbial communities. We also found a remarkable seasonal rhythm in red squirrels gut microbial composition manifested by a tradeoff between relative abundance of two genera Oscillospira and Corpococcus and clearly associated with seasonal variation in diet availability. Our results show that in nature, environmental factors exert a much stronger influence on gut microbiota than host-associated factors including age and sex. Despite strong environmental effects, we found clear evidence of individuality and maternal effects, but host genetics did not seem to be a significant driver of the gut microbial communities in red squirrels. Conclusion: Taken together, the results of this study emphasize the importance of external ecological factors rather than host attributes in driving temporal and spatial patterns of gut microbiota in natural environment.","2017","5","10.1186/s40168-017-0382-3","me","not yet"

Knowledge about the diversity and distribution patterns as well as drivers of microbial eukaryote (including ciliates) along the water column, particularly below the photic zone, is scarce. In this study, we investigated the diversity of pelagic ciliates, the main group of marine microeukaryotes, their vertical distribution from the surface to the abyssopelagic zone, as well as their horizontal distribution over a distance of 1,300 km in the Western Pacific Ocean, using high-throughput DNA and cDNA (complementary DNA) sequencing. No distance-decay relationship could be detected along the horizontal scale; instead, a distinct vertical distribution within the ciliate communities was revealed. The alpha diversity of the ciliate communities in the deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) and the 200 m layer turned out to be significantly higher compared with the other water layers. The ciliate communities in the 200 m water layer appeared to be more similar to those in deeper layers from 1,000 m to about 5,000 m than to the surface and DCM ciliate communities. Dominant species in the bathypelagic and abyssopelagic zone, particularly some parasites, were also detected in the 200 m layer, but were almost absent in the surface layer. The 200 m layer, therefore, seems to be an important species bank for deep ocean layers. Statistical analyses further revealed significant effects of temperature and chlorophyll a on the partitioning of ciliate diversity, indicating that environmental factors are a stronger force in shaping marine pelagic ciliate communities than the geographic distance.","2017","8","10.3389/fmicb.2017.02559","me","not yet"

Hence, the current study was conducted to determine their abundance and diversity within Pacific sediments along the 180 degrees meridian. We hypothesize a distinct biogeographical distribution of benthic members of the Roseobacter group linked to nutrient availability within the sediments and productivity of the water column. Lowest cell numbers were counted at the edge of the south Pacific gyre and within the north Pacific gyre followed by an increase to the north with maximum values in the highly productive Bering Sea. Specific quantification of the Roseobacter group revealed on average a relative abundance of 1.7 and 6.3% as determined by catalyzed reported deposition-fluorescence in situ hybridization (CARD-FISH) and quantitative PCR (qPCR), respectively. Corresponding Illumina tag sequencing of 16S rRNA genes and 16S rRNA transcripts showed different compositions containing on average 0.7 and 0.9% Roseobacter-affiliated OTUs of the DNA- and RNA-based communities. These OTUs were mainly assigned to uncultured members of the Roseobacter group. Among those with cultured representatives, Sedimentitalea and Sulfitobacter made up the largest proportions. The different oceanic provinces with low nutrient content such as both ocean gyres were characterized by specific communities of the Roseobacter group, distinct from those of the more productive Pacific subarctic region and the Bering Sea. However, linking the community structure to specific metabolic processes at the seafloor is hampered by the dominance of so-far uncultured members of the Roseobacter group, indicating a diversity that has yet to be explored.","2017","8","10.3389/fmicb.2017.02550","me","not yet"

Modern advances in sequencing technology have enabled the census of microbial members of many natural ecosystems. Recently, attention is increasingly being paid to the microbial residents of human-made, built ecosystems, both private (homes) and public (subways, office buildings, and hospitals). Here, we report results of the characterization of the microbial ecology of a singular built environment, the International Space Station (ISS). This ISS sampling involved the collection and microbial analysis (via 16S rDNA PCR) of 15 surfaces sampled by swabs onboard the ISS. This sampling was a component of Project MERCCURI (Microbial Ecology Research Combining Citizen and University Researchers on ISS). Learning more about the microbial inhabitants of the buildings in which we travel through space will take on increasing importance as plans for human exploration continue with the possibility of colonization of other planets and moons. Results. Sterile swabs were used to sample 15 surfaces onboard the ISS. The sites sampled were designed to be analogous to samples collected for (1) the Wildlife of Our Homes project and (2) a study of cell phones and shoes that were concurrently being collected for another component of Project MERCCURL Sequencing of the 16S rDNA genes amplified from DNA extracted from each swab was used to produce a census of the microbes present on each surface sampled. We compared the microbes found on the ISS swabs to those from both homes on Earth and data from the Human Microbiome Project. Conclusions. While significantly different from homes on Earth and the Human Microbiome Project samples analyzed here, the microbial community composition on the ISS was more similar to home surfaces than to the human microbiome samples. The ISS surfaces are species-rich with 1,036-4,294 operational taxonomic units (OTUs per sample).

Equipped with high-throughput methods for studying the taxonomic and functional characteristics of diverse samples, they are just beginning to encounter the conceptual, theoretical, and experimental problems of comparing taxonomy to (micro-ecological) function, and extracting useful measures from such comparisons (i.e. diversity, stability, or health). Although still unresolved, these problems are well studied in macro-ecology (the ecology of non-microbes) and are reiterated here as an historical precautionary for microbial ecologists. Beyond expected and unresolved terminological vagueness, we argue that assessments and comparisons of taxonomic and functional profiles in micro-ecology suffer from theoretically unresolvable arbitrariness and ambiguities. We divide these into problems of scale, individuation, and commensurability. We argue that there is no technically/theoretically correct scale, individuation, or comparison of taxonomy and function, but there are nonetheless better and worse methodologies for profiling.","2017","32","10.1007/s10539-017-9602-2","me","not yet"

However, we still lack an understanding of how these communities are organized across GIT in natural environments. Here, using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we analyzed the bacterial community diversity, network interactions and ecosystem stability across five gut regions (mouth, stomach, small intestine, cecum and colon) emanating from two common pika species in China, including Plateau pikas (Ochotona curzoniae) inhabiting high-altitude regions, as well as Daurian pikas (O. daurica) occupying low-altitude areas. The relative abundances of dominant Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes exhibited an increasing trend from mouth to colon. Cecum and colon harbored higher bacterial diversity compared with other anatomical regions. Gut region significantly influenced the structure of bacterial communities in the GIT. Network analysis indicated that topological features showed marked variations among gut regions. Interestingly, the ecosystem stability of bacterial communities increased gradually from mouth to colon. Our results suggest that gut region influences the diversity, structure and network interactions of bacterial communities in pikas. For hindgut-fermenting herbivorous mammals, relatively higher bacterial diversity and ecosystem stability in the cecum may provide a favorable condition for the fermentation of indigestible plant polysaccharides.","2017","93","10.1093/femsec/fix149","me","not yet"

Here, we undertook a proof-of-principle metaproteogenomic investigation on luminal and mucosal samples collected from 10 GITs of a 30-day-old pre-weaned lamb. We demonstrate that the analysis of the diverse ecological niches along the GITs can reveal microbiota composition and metabolic functions, although low amounts of microbial proteins could be identified in the small intestinal and mucosal samples. Our data suggest that a 30-day lamb has already developed mature microbial functions in the forestomachs, while the effect of the milky diet appears to be more evident in the remaining GITs. We also report the distribution and the relative abundance of the host functions, active at the GIT level, with a special focus on those involved in digestive processes.

Data were collected on two cruises, one in November 2012, and one in May 2013. Special focus was on the impact of advective processes and how these are reflected in the autochthonous and allochthonous fractions of the bacterial communities. Both in November and May bacterial community composition, determined by Automated Ribosomal Intergenic Spacer Analyses (ARISA), in the surface and intermediate water appeared to be highly related to bacterial communities originating from freshwater runoff and coastal water, whereas the sources in the basin water were mostly unknown. Additionally, the inner part of the Sognefjord was more influenced by side-fjords than the outer part, and changes in bacterial community structure along the coast-fjord gradient generally showed higher correlation with environmental variables than with geographic distances. High resolution model simulations indicated a surprisingly high degree of temporal and spatial variation in both current speed and direction. This led to a more episodic/discontinuous horizontal current pattern, with several vortices (10-20 km wide) being formed from time to time along the fjord. We conclude that during periods of strong wind forcing, advection led to allochthonous species being introduced to the surface and intermediate layers of the fjord, and also appeared to homogenize community composition in the basin water. We also expect vortices to be active mixing zones where inflowing bacterial populations on the southern side of the fjord are mixed with the outflowing populations on the northern side. On average, retention time of the fjord water was sufficient for bacterial communities to be established.","2017","159","10.1016/j.pocean.2017.09.002","me","not yet"

In this study, we compared the microbial community composition of leaves and berries of a grape variety (Carmenere) from six different Chilean vineyards within 35 km of each other. In order to determine relationships between spatial proximity and microbial compositional dissimilarity, we sequenced amplicons of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region for fungi and 16S rRNA gene for bacteria. Results showed that both the fungal and the bacterial community compositions of the studied vineyards differed, but this difference was much clearer in fungi than in bacteria. In addition, while bacterial community dissimilarity was not correlated with geographic distance, the leaf and berry fungal community dissimilarities between locations increased with geographic distance. This indicates that spatial processes play an important role in structuring the biogeographic pattern of grape-associated fungal communities at local scales, which might in turn contribute to the local identity of wine.","2017","9","10.1111/1758-2229.12589","me","not yet"

We compared our dataset to a library of nirS sequences obtained previously from the same samples by standard PCR cloning and Sanger sequencing, and showed that both methods similarly demonstrated geography, salinity and, to a lesser extent, nitrogen, to be strong determinants of community composition. Furthermore, the depth afforded by NGS enabled novel techniques for measuring the association between environment and community composition. We used Random Forests modelling to demonstrate that the site and salinity of a sample could be predicted from its nirS sequences, and to identify indicator taxa associated with those environmental characteristics.

We tested the algal SAR in lakes, pools and ponds of various sizes (10(-2)-10(8)m(2)) and similar hydromorphological and trophic characteristics using species-specific data and functional groups. Besides the expectation that species richness increases monotonously with area, we found a right-skewed hump-shaped relationship between the area and phytoplankton species richness. Functional richness however did not show such distortion. Differences between the area dependence of species and functional richness indicate that functional redundancy is responsible for the unusual hump-backed SAR. We demonstrated that the Small Island Effect, which is a characteristic for macroscopic SARs can also be observed for the phytoplankton. Our results imply a so-called large lake effect, which means that in case of large lakes, wind-induced mixing acts strongly against the habitat diversity and development of phytoplankton patchiness and finally results in lower phytoplankton species richness in the pelagial. High functional redundancy of the groups that prefer small-scale heterogeneity of the habitats is responsible for the unusual humpback relationship. The results lead us to conclude that although the mechanisms that regulate the richness of both microbial communities and communities of macroscopic organisms are similar, their importance can be different in micro- and macroscales.","2017","7","10.1002/ece3.3512","me","not yet"

The collected profiles revealed the presence of 89 putative novel bifidobacterial taxa in addition to 45 previously described species. Remarkably, in contrast to what is currently known for many gut commensals, we did not observe host-specialization among bifidobacterial species but rather their widespread distribution across mammals. Moreover, ITS rRNA profiling of wild relatives of domesticated dogs, rabbits and pigs clearly indicates that domestication and close contact with humans have impacted on the composition of the fecal bifidobacterial population. These data were complemented by analysis of bifidobacterial communities in milk of eight mammalian families, showing that bifidobacteria represent prototypical early gut microbiota members which are inherited by newborns from their lactating mother.

We collected soil samples heavily contaminated by e-waste recycling in China and Pakistan, and analyzed the indigenous microbial communities. The results of this work revealed that the microbial community composition and diversity, at both whole and core community levels, were affected significantly by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and heavy metals (e.g., Cu, Zn, and Pb). The geographical distance showed limited impacts on microbial communities compared with geochemical factors.

Biogeographical regionalization has been demonstrated for many higher taxa, such as terrestrial plants and vertebrates, but not in microbial communities. Therefore, we sought to test empirically whether microbial communities, or taxa, showpatterns consistent with biogeographical regionalization. Location: Within halite (NaCl) crystals from coastal solar salterns of western Europe, the Mediterranean and east Africa. Time period: Modern (2006-2013). Major taxa studied: Archaea. Methods: Using high-throughput Illumina amplicon sequencing, we generated the most high-resolution characterization of halite-associated archaeal communities to date, using samples from 17 locations. We grouped communities into biogeographical clusters based on community turnover to test whether these communities show biogeographical regionalization. To examine whether individual taxa, rather than communities, show biogeographical patterns, we also tested whether the relative abundance of individual genera may be indicative of a communitys biogeographical origins using machine learning methods, specifically random forest classification. Results: We found that the rate of community turnover was greatest over subregional spatial scales (< 500 km), whereas at regional spatial scales the turnover was independent of geographical distance. Biogeographical clusters of communities were either not statistically robust or lacked spatial coherence, inconsistent with biogeographical regionalization. However, we identified several archaeal genera that were good indicators of biogeographical origin, providing classification error rates of <10%. Main conclusions: Overall, our results provide little support for the concept of biogeographical regions in these extremophilic microbial communities, despite the fact that some taxa do show biogeographical patterns. We suggest that variable dispersal ability among the halite-associated Archaea may disrupt biogeographical patterns at the community level, preventing the formation of biogeographical regions. This means that the processes that lead to the formation of biogeographical regions operate differentially on individual microbial taxa rather than on entire communities.","2017","26","10.1111/geb.12670","me","not yet"

We used high-throughput sequencing to reveal the diversities and community structures of rhizospheric fungi and their link with nitrogen-fixing Frankia harbored in sea buckthorn collected along an altitude gradient from the Qinghai Tibet Plateau to interior areas. We found that the fungal diversities and compositions varied between different sites. Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, and Zygomycota were the dominant phyla. The distribution of sea buckthorn rhizospheric fungi was driven by both environmental factors and the geographic distance. Among all examined soil characteristics, altitude, AP, and pH were found to have significant (p<0.05) effect on the rhizospheric fungal community. The rhizospheric fungal communities became more distinct as the distance increased. Moreover, co-inertia analysis identified significant co-structures between Frankia and AMF communities in the rhizosphere of sea buckthorn.

Despite their ecological importance in supraglacial environments, the phylogeographical distributions of supraglacial cyanobacteria are poorly understood. Here, we investigate the biogeographical distribution of cyanobacteria on glaciers in the Antarctic, Arctic and Asia. LocationGlaciers in the Antarctic, Arctic and Asia. MethodsWe analysed contiguous sequences of 16S rRNA genes and 16S-23S internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions, determined by a long read strategy and single-filament PCR analysis in 38 glacial samples. We analysed cyanobacterial distribution patterns and genetic differentiation. ResultsThe cyanobacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences were grouped into 20 operational taxonomic units (OTUs), and the six major OTUs that accounted for 88% of sequences were distributed broadly from polar to Asian glaciers, suggesting that they are cosmopolitan at the species level. However, analysis of the more variable ITS region revealed geographical differentiation at the strain level. Nineteen OTUs, including the six major OTUs, showed considerable genetic differentiation among geographical regions; at the population level, they are, thus, geographically restricted. Only one of the phylotype exhibits a population structure which does not show a relationship with geographical distribution, suggesting that is cosmopolitan, even at the strain level. Main conclusionsOur 16S rRNA gene analyses suggest a global distribution of species of cyanobacteria colonizing glacier surfaces; however, the 16S-23S ITS regions revealed that most of the phylotypes are fundamentally endemic to particular areas at the population level and indicate limited migration among regions. Our result suggests that selection pressures among geographical regions are strong driving forces shaping genetic structure in cyanobacteria.","2017","44","10.1111/jbi.13089","me","not yet"

Microbes colonize the neonatal gut immediately following birth. The establishment and interactive development of this early gut microbiota are believed to be (at least partially) driven and modulated by specific compounds present in human milk. It has been shown that certain genomes of infant gut commensals, in particular those of bifidobacterial species, are genetically adapted to utilize specific glycans of this human secretory fluid, thus representing a very intriguing example of host-microbe coevolution, where both partners are believed to benefit. In recent years, various metagenomic studies have tried to dissect the composition and functionality of the infant gut microbiome and to explore the distribution across the different ecological niches of the infant gut biogeography of the corresponding microbial consortia, including those corresponding to bacteria and viruses, in healthy and ill subjects. Such analyses have linked certain features of the microbiota/microbiome, such as reduced diversity or aberrant composition, to intestinal illnesses in infants or disease states that are manifested at later stages of life, including asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, and metabolic disorders. Thus, a growing number of studies have reported on how the early human gut microbiota composition/development may affect risk factors related to adult health conditions. This concept has fueled the development of strategies to shape the infant microbiota composition based on various functional food products. In this review, we describe the infant microbiota, the mechanisms that drive its establishment and composition, and how microbial consortia may be molded by natural or artificial interventions. Finally, we discuss the relevance of key microbial players of the infant gut microbiota, in particular bifidobacteria, with respect to their role in health and disease.","2017","81","10.1128/MMBR.00036-17","me","not yet"

Although stochastic processes are believed to play non-negligible roles in shaping community structure, their importance relative to deterministic processes is hotly debated. The importance of ecological stochasticity in shaping microbial community structure is far less appreciated. Some of the main reasons for such heavy debates are the difficulty in defining stochasticity and the diverse methods used for delineating stochasticity. Here, we provide a critical review and synthesis of data from the most recent studies on stochastic community assembly in microbial ecology. We then describe both stochastic and deterministic components embedded in various ecological processes, including selection, dispersal, diversification, and drift. We also describe different approaches for inferring stochasticity from observational diversity patterns and highlight experimental approaches for delineating ecological stochasticity in microbial communities.

Soil microorganisms play important roles in regulating biogeochemical cycles and maintaining ecosystem function. However, our knowledge of patterns and drivers of permafrost microbial communities is limited over broad geographic scales. Using high-throughput Illumina sequencing, this study compared soil bacterial, archaeal and fungal communities between the active and permafrost layers on the Tibetan Plateau. Our results indicated that microbial alpha diversity was significantly higher in the active layer than in the permafrost layer with the exception of fungal Shannon-Wiener index and Simpsons diversity index, and microbial community structures were significantly different between the two layers. Our results also revealed that environmental factors such as soil fertility (soil organic carbon, dissolved organic carbon and total nitrogen contents) were the primary drivers of the beta diversity of bacterial, archaeal and fungal communities in the active layer. In contrast, environmental variables such as the mean annual precipitation and total phosphorus played dominant roles in driving the microbial beta diversity in the permafrost layer. Spatial distance was important for predicting the bacterial and archaeal beta diversity in both the active and permafrost layers, but not for fungal communities. Collectively, these results demonstrated different driving factors of microbial beta diversity between the active layer and permafrost layer, implying that the drivers of the microbial beta diversity observed in the active layer cannot be used to predict the biogeographic patterns of the microbial beta diversity in the permafrost layer.","2017","26","10.1111/mec.14396","me","not yet"

Here, we use a natural experimental system of isolated tree islands to test whether environment or geography primarily structures fungal community composition at fine spatial scales. This system consists of isolated pairs of two distantly related, congeneric pine trees established at varying distances from each other and the forest edge, allowing us to disentangle the effects of geographic distance vs. host and edaphic environment on associated fungal communities. We identified fungal community composition with Illumina sequencing of ITS amplicons, measured all relevant environmental parameters for each tree-including tree age, size and soil chemistry-and calculated geographic distances from each tree to all others and to the nearest forest edge. We applied generalized dissimilarity modelling to test whether total and ectomycorrhizal fungal (EMF) communities were primarily structured by geographic or environmental filtering. Our results provide strong evidence that as in many other organisms, niche and neutral processes both contribute significantly to turnover in community composition in fungi, but environmental filtering plays the dominant role in structuring both free-living and symbiotic fungal communities at fine spatial scales. In our study system, we found pH and organic matter primarily drive environmental filtering in total soil fungal communities and that pH and cation exchange capacity-and, surprisingly, not host species-were the largest factors affecting EMF community composition. These findings support an emerging paradigm that pH may play a central role in the assembly of all soilmediated systems.","2017","26","10.1111/mec.14414","me","not yet"

We used 454 pyrosequencing approaches to investigate the fungal communities at 1600, 2300, 2800, 3000, and 3900 m above sea level along an altitudinal gradient on Mount Gongga. The results showed that Agaricomycetes, Sordariomycetes, and Tremellomycetes are the dominant classes at all sampling sites. Operational taxonomic unit richness decreased with increasing altitude, and the fungal communities were clustered into three groups that corresponded to altitudes of, i.e., 1600, 2300, and above 2800 m. The evenness of fungi was not significantly correlated with altitude, whereas beta diversities were significantly correlated with altitude. The distance-based redundancy analysis and Mantel test indicated that the composition of fungal assemblages was mostly driven by altitude and temperature.

Phylogenetic and genomic evidence indicates that N2O reducing communities can be divided into two genetically distinct groups, termed Glade I and II. Differing abundance or diversity of each Glade may have significant consequences for N2O emissions from soil. However, whether the two groups respond similarly to gradients of environmental or biotic factors in soils remains unclear. Here, we explore spatial patterns of nosZ Glade I and II abundance, phylogenetic diversity and community structure across a 44-ha farm, and compare with edaphic factors and abundances of ammonia oxidizing and denitrifying communities, which are the main N2O producers in soil. Contrasting spatial distributions of the total abundance and phylogenetic diversity of each Glade, as well as disparate associations with various edaphic and biotic factors indicated potential niche differentiation between the two clades. This is supported by the greater occurrence of significant phylogenetic clustering or overdispersion in Glade I communities compared to Glade II, indicating differences in the underlying mechanisms of community assembly for each group. Variance partitioning of phylogenetic community structure further showed that biotic factors, particularly the abundance of denitrifiers, played a more substantial role in explaining Glade II community structure compared to that of Glade I. Finally, identification of nosZ lineages driving differences in community structure and spatial distribution patterns of gene abundances suggests a shift in the genetic potential for N2O production and consumption dynamics across the farm.

Although total bacterial communities in rhizosphere were not significantly differentiated across ecoregions, rpoB amplicon sequencing uncovered that Rhizobium laguerreae and Rhizobium anhuiense were predominant in different samples with contrasting pH or salt content.

Skin microbiome varies from person to person due to a combination of various factors, including age, biogeography, sex, cosmetics and genetics. Many skin disorders appear to be related to the resident microflora, yet databases of facial skin microbiome of many biogeographies, including Thai, are limited. Methods. Metagenomics derived B-RISA and 16S rRNA gene sequencing was utilized to identify the culture-independent bacterial diversity on Thai male faces (cheek and forehead areas). Skin samples were categorized (grouped) into (i) normal (teertage.hea) and (ii) acne-prone (teenage.acn) young adults, and normal (iii) middle-aged (middle.hea) and (iv) elderly (elderly.hea) adults. Results. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing was successful as the sequencing depth had an estimated >98% genus coverage of the true community. The major diversity was found between the young and elderly adults in both cheek and foreheadareas, followed are s, followed by that between normal and acne young adults. Detection ofrepresentative characteristics indicated that bacteria from the order Rhizobiales, genera Sphingomonas and Pseudoalteromortas, distinguished the elderly.hea microbiota, along the clinical features of wrinkles and pores. Prediction of the metabolic potential revealed reduced metabolic pathways involved in replication and repair, nucleotide metabolism and genetic translation in the elderly.hea compared with that in the. tee.nage.hea. For young adults, some unique compositions such as abundance of Proptombacteriurn ac!tes and Staphylococcus epidermidis, with a minor diversity between normal and acne skins, were detected. The metabolic potentials of the acne vs. normal young adults showed that teenage.acn was low in many cellular processes (e.g., cell motility and environmental adaptation), but high in carbohydrate metabolism, which could support acne growth. Moreover, comparison with the age-matched males from the US (Boulder, Colorado) to gain insight into the diversity, across national biogeography, revealed differ!nces in the distribution pattern of species, although common bacteria were present in both biogeographical samples. Furthermore, B-RISA served as a crosscheck result to the 16S rRNA gene sequencing (i.e., differences between teenage and elderly microbiota) Conclusions.

However, the diverse endophytic non-rhizobial bacteria in legume nodules that co-exist with rhizobia are often ignored because they are difficult to cultivate using routine cultivation approaches. To enhance our understanding of the incidence and diversity of legume-bacteria associations, a high-throughput sequencing analysis of bacterial 16S rRNA genes was used to examine the bacterial community in the rhizospheres and root nodules of Dalbergia odorifera seedlings that were uninoculated or inoculated with Bradyrhizobium elkanii H255, Rhizobium multihospitium-like HT221, or Burkholderia pyrrocinia-like H022238, in two growth media (nitrogen [N]-supplied soil or N-omitted potting mix). Seedlings inoculated with Bradyrhizobium had significantly more nodules than seedlings in the other inoculation conditions, regardless of growth media. Using the N-15 natural abundance method, it was shown that the inoculated plants had significantly higher N-2 fixation efficiency (48-57%) and specific nodule activity [269-313 mu g N mg(-1) of dry weight (dwt) nodule] compared to the uninoculated plants (203 mu g N mg(-1) dwt nodule). The 16S rRNA gene analysis showed that there was generally a higher bacterial diversity in the rhizosphere than in the nodules in the corresponding condition. Both rhizobial inoculation and media status significantly altered the bacterial communities in the rhizospheres and nodules (P < 0.05), with the exception of the inoculated soil rhizospheres. Regarding non-rhizobial bacteria, three genera, i.e., Lactococcus, Bacillus, and Pseudomonas, were consistently enriched in the rhizosphere and Bradyrhizobium, Chloroplast norank (which belongs to Cyanobacteria), and Lactococcus were commonly found in the nodules. In contrast, common rhizobial genera (including Rhizobium, Mesorhizobium, and Burkholderia) were only present in the nodules at low relative abundances (0.01-3.41%). Regarding non-rhizobial bacteria, 32 genera were found in the nodules, with non-rhizobial bacteria being predominant in the N omitted potting mix (with a relative abundance of 56-87%). This study suggests that legume nodules are inhabited by a high diversity of non-rhizobial bacteria, which may play a vital role in nodulation and N-2 fixation in the host plants.","2017","8","10.3389/fmicb.2017.02255","me","not yet"

However, many of the statistical issues that plague such analyses in macroscale communities remain unresolved for microbial communities. Here, we discuss problems in the analysis of microbial species correlations based on presence-absence data. We focus on presence-absence data because this information is more readily obtainable from sequencing studies, especially for whole-genome sequencing, where abundance estimation is still in its infancy. First, we show how Pearsons correlation coefficient (r) and Jaccards index (J)-two of the most common metrics for correlation analysis of presence-absence data-can contradict each other when applied to a typical microbiome dataset. In our dataset, for example, 14% of species-pairs predicted to be significantly correlated by r were not predicted to be significantly correlated using J, while 37.4% of species-pairs predicted to be significantly correlated by J were not predicted to be significantly correlated using r. Mismatch was particularly common among species-pairs with at least one rare species (<10% prevalence), explaining why r and J might differ more strongly in microbiome datasets, where there are large numbers of rare taxa. Indeed 74% of all species-pairs in our study had at least one rare species. Next, we show how Pearsons correlation coefficient can result in artificial inflation of positive taxon relationships and how this is a particular problem for microbiome studies. We then illustrate how Jaccards index of similarity (J) can yield improvements over Pearsons correlation coefficient. However, the standard null model for Jaccards index is flawed, and thus introduces its own set of spurious conclusions. We thus identify a better null model based on a hypergeometric distribution, which appropriately corrects for species prevalence. This model is available from recent statistics literature, and can be used for evaluating the significance of any value of an empirically observed Jaccards index. The resulting simple, yet effective method for handling correlation analysis of microbial presence-absence datasets provides a robust means of testing and finding relationships and/or shared environmental responses among microbial taxa.","2017","12","10.1371/journal.pone.0187132","me","not yet"

Detection of areas of endemism using Parsimony Analysis of Endemicity (PAE)","PROCEEDINGS OF THE BIOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF WASHINGTON","Geographical patterns in microorganisms distribution is a matter of intense debate. Following the assumption that everything is everywhere (EiE hypothesis), it is expected that microscopic animals do not have any scale spatial pattern of distribution due to high abundances, resting stages, and long-distance dispersal. Gastrotrichs are one of the most common components of the marine soft-body meiofauna. To assess the validity of EiE hypotheses on marine gastrotrichs, we applied Parsimony Analysis of Endemism (PAE) to identify areas of endemism. We used provinces of coastal and continental shelves of the world as operational units to define the distribution of 458 marine species of Gastrotricha. We found 10 areas of endemism, most of them were recorded from Europe and North America, and some areas were also consistent with the distribution of other benthic groups. An area of endemism is obtained when at least two species are perfectly congruent in their distribution. Moreover, the state of knowledge of the true species distribution is directly related to the intensity and spatial variation of the sampling effort. Thus, it is not a surprise to note that most areas of endemism are in the North Hemisphere, where gastrotrichs have been especially and longer sampled and their geographic range size is well known. On the other hand, the absence of endemism areas in South Hemisphere is related to sampling insufficiency. However, some level of endemism was found and the ubiquitous distribution of gastrotrich species is strongly questioned.","2017","130","10.2988/17-00011","me","not yet"

We assessed bacterial and fungal communities by sequencing bacterial 16S rRNA gene and fungal ITS data. Meanwhile, the beta-diversity was decomposed into two components: species replacement (species turnover) and nestedness to further explore the bacterial and fungal beta-diversity patterns and its causes. The results show that both bacterial and fungal beta-diversity were derived almost entirely from species turnover rather than from species nestedness. Distance-decay relationships confirmed that the geographic patterns of bacterial and fungal beta-diversity were significantly different. Environmental factors had the dominant influence on both the bacterial and fungal beta-diversity and species turnover, however, the role of geographic distance varied across bacterial and fungal communities. Furthermore, both bacterial and fungal nestedness did not significantly respond to the environmental and geographic distance. Our findings suggest that the different response of bacterial and fungal species turnover to dispersal limitation and other, unknown processes may result in different biogeographic patterns of bacterial and fungal beta-diversity in the drylands of northwest China. Together, we highlight that the drivers of beta-diversity patterns vary between bacterial and fungal communities, and microbial beta-diversity are driven by multiple factors in the drylands of northwest China.","2017","8","10.3389/fmicb.2017.02126","me","not yet"

We studied the bacterial communities of eight soils selected along a pedogenic gradient at the local scale in a Mediterranean calcareous mountain (Sierra de Maria, SE Spain). The results showed that the relative abundance of Acidobacteria, Canditate division WPS-1, and Armatimonadetes decreased whereas that of Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria increased from the less-developed soils (Leptosol) to more-developed soils (Luvisol). This bacterial distribution pattern was also positively correlated with soil-quality parameters such as organic C, water-stable aggregates, porosity, moisture, and acidity. In addition, at a lower taxonomic level, the abundance of Acidobacteria Gp4, Armatimonadetes_gp4, Solirubrobacter, Microvirga, Terrimonas, and Nocardioides paralleled soil development and quality. Therefore, our work indicates that the composition of bacterial populations changes with pedogenesis, which could be considered a factor influencing the communities according to the environmental and physicochemical conditions during the soil formation.","2017","7","10.1038/s41598-017-15133-x","me","not yet"

An archipelago is featured by distinct and unique gradients between and within islands. The multiple gradient effects on the island ecosystem are worth exploring. We established a multiple gradient system comprising natural, human, and ecological gradients in island and site scales. The natural gradients consist of island area, shape, and distance to mainland in island scale, and terrain and distance to shoreline in site scale; the human gradients include population and exploitation in island scale, and distance to hardened ground in site scale; and the ecological gradients are composed of community type, biomass, biodiversity, and soil physical-chemical properties in site scale. SMB, including SMB carbon (SMBC), SMB nitrogen (SMBN), and SMB phosphorus (SMBP), was used to verify the multiple gradient effects on the island ecosystem, and the northern Miaodao Archipelago in North China was selected as the study area. Results revealed that SMB exhibited distinct spatial heterogeneities. SMBC was sensitive to the natural and human gradients in both scales; SMBN was influenced by parts of natural, human, and ecological gradients in both scales; and SMBP did not show regular changes along the gradients in island scale, yet responded sensitively to the ecological gradients in site scale. The multiple gradient system is unique and fundamental in the spatial heterogeneities of the island ecosystem, and fully revealing the multiple gradient effects is essential for reasonable island conservation and exploitation.","2017","83","10.1016/j.ejsobi.2017.10.006","me","not yet"

Despite its evolutionary importance, only a handful of bacterial, genome-wide cytosine studies have been conducted, with none for marine bacteria. Here, we examine the genome-wide, C-5-Methyl-cytosine (m5C) methylome and its correlation to global transcription in the marine nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium Trichodesmium. We characterize genome-wide methylation and highlight conserved motifs across three Trichodesmium isolates and two Trichodesmium metagenomes, thereby identifying highly conserved, novel genomic signatures of potential gene regulation in Trichodesmium. Certain gene bodies with the highest methylation levels correlate with lower expression levels. Several methylated motifs were highly conserved across spatiotemporally separated Trichodesmium isolates, thereby elucidating biogeographically conserved methylation potential. These motifs were also highly conserved in Trichodesmium metagenomic samples from natural populations suggesting them to be potential in situ markers of m5C methylation. Using these data, we highlight predicted roles of cytosine methylation in global cellular metabolism providing evidence for a core m5C methylome spanning different ocean regions.

"Herren, CM; McMahon, KD","Cohesion: a method for quantifying the connectivity of microbial communities","ISME JOURNAL","The ability to predict microbial community dynamics lags behind the quantity of data available in these systems. Most predictive models use only environmental parameters, although a long history of ecological literature suggests that community complexity should also be an informative parameter. Thus, we hypothesize that incorporating information about a communitys complexity might improve predictive power in microbial models. Here, we present a new metric, called community cohesion, that quantifies the degree of connectivity of a microbial community. We analyze six long-term (10+ years) microbial data sets using the cohesion metrics and validate our approach using data sets where absolute abundances of taxa are available. As a case study of our metrics utility, we show that community cohesion is a strong predictor of Bray-Curtis dissimilarity (R-2 = 0.47) between phytoplankton communities in Lake Mendota, WI, USA. Our cohesion metrics outperform a model built using all available environmental data collected during a long-term sampling program. The result that cohesion corresponds strongly to Bray-Curtis dissimilarity is consistent across the six long-term time series, including five phytoplankton data sets and one bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing data set. We explain here the calculation of our cohesion metrics and their potential uses in microbial ecology.","2017","11","10.1038/ismej.2017.91","me","not yet"

A Review and Commentary","ARCHIVES OF MEDICAL RESEARCH","Although there is a consensus that the dominant species that make up the adult micro biota remains unchanged in elderly people, it has been reported that there are significant alterations in the proportion and composition of the different taxa, leading to reduced microbiota diversity, as well as an increase of enteropathogens that may lead to chronic inflammation. The ageing of mucosal immune and motor systems also contributes to these changes. As the individual ages, there is a loss in the number of Peyers patches, an altered local capacity of T and B cell functions as well as chronic macrophage activation. Also, environment, diet, place of residence and biogeography are regulatory factors of the microbiota. Communication in the gut-brain-axis is regulated by many intermediaries including diverse metabolites of the microbiota. Microbial changes have been observed in several geriatric diseases, like Parkinsons and Alzheimers. In addition, evidence has shown that individuals with high frailty scores had a significant reduction on lactobacilli species when compared to non-frail individuals. Oral microbiota may be also especially important because of the opportunities for access to the brain through the olfactory nerve at the roof of the nose or through the abundant innervations of the oral cavity by the trigeminal and other cranial nerves. Also, there are an increasing number of reports that have suggested potential mechanisms by which the microbiota promote human health span and aging. The study of the microbiota represents an important advance in the understanding of the aging process. (C) 2017 IMSS.

In some marine settings, Thaumarchaeotes can comprise a large percentage of the prokaryotic population. To better understand the biogeographic patterns of Thaumarchaeotes, we sought to investigate differences in their abundance and phylogenetic diversity between geographically distinct basins. Samples were collected from four marine basins (The Caspian Sea, the Great Australian Bight, and the Central and Eastern Mediterranean). The concentration of bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA genes and archaeal amoA genes were assessed using qPCR. Minimum entropy decomposition was used to elucidate the fine-scale diversity of Thaumarchaeotes. We demonstrated that there were significant differences in the abundance and diversity of Thaumarchaeotes between these four basins. The diversity of Thaumarchaeotal oligotypes differed between basins with many oligotypes only present in one of the four basins, which suggests that their distribution showed biogeographic patterning. There were also significant differences in Thaumarchaeotal community structure between these basins. This would suggest that geographically distant, yet geochemically similar basins may house distinct Thaumarchaeaotal populations. These findings suggest that Thaumarchaeota are very diverse and that biogeography in part contributes in determining the diversity and distribution of Thaumarchaeotes.","2017","93","10.1093/femsec/fix128","me","not yet"

The long-term ecological challenges associated with maintaining soil fertility in managed forests are not yet known, in part due to the complexity of soil microbial communities and the heterogeneity of forest soils. This study determined the long-term effects of timber harvesting, accompanied by varied organic matter (OM) removal, on bacterial and fungal soil populations in 11-to 17-year-old reforested coniferous plantations at 18 sites across North America. Analysis of highly replicated 16 S rRNA gene and ITS region pyrotag libraries and shotgun metagenomes demonstrated consistent changes in microbial communities in harvested plots that included the expansion of desiccation-and heat-tolerant organisms and decline in diversity of ectomycorrhizal fungi. However, the majority of taxa, including the most abundant and cosmopolitan groups, were unaffected by harvesting. Shifts in microbial populations that corresponded to increased temperature and soil dryness were moderated by OM retention, which also selected for sub-populations of fungal decomposers. Biogeographical differences in the distribution of taxa as well as local edaphic and environmental conditions produced substantial variation in the effects of harvesting. This extensive molecular-based investigation of forest soil advances our understanding of forest disturbance and lays the foundation for monitoring long-term impacts of timber harvesting.","2017","11","10.1038/ismej.2017.109","me","not yet"
"Chase, AB; Karaoz, U; Brodie, EL; Gomez-Lunar, Z; Martiny, AC; Martiny, JBH","Microdiversity of an Abundant Terrestrial Bacterium Encompasses Extensive Variation in Ecologically Relevant Traits","MBIO","Much genetic diversity within a bacterial community is likely obscured by microdiversity within operational taxonomic units (OTUs) defined by 16S rRNA gene sequences. However, it is unclear how variation within this microdiversity influences ecologically relevant traits. Here, we employ a multifaceted approach to investigate microdiversity within the dominant leaf litter bacterium, Curtobacterium, which comprises 7.8% of the bacterial community at a grassland site undergoing global change manipulations. We use cultured bacterial isolates to interpret metagenomic data, collected in situ over 2 years, together with lab-based physiological assays to determine the extent of trait variation within this abundant OTU. The response of Curtobacterium to seasonal variability and the global change manipulations, specifically an increase in relative abundance under decreased water availability, appeared to be conserved across six Curtobacterium lineages identified at this site. Genomic and physiological analyses in the lab revealed that degradation of abundant polymeric carbohydrates within leaf litter, cellulose and xylan, is nearly universal across the genus, which may contribute to its high abundance in grassland leaf litter. However, the degree of carbohydrate utilization and temperature preference for this degradation varied greatly among clades. Overall, we find that traits within Curtobacterium are conserved at different phylogenetic depths. We speculate that similar to bacteria in marine systems, diverse microbes within this taxon may be structured in distinct ecotypes that are key to understanding Curtobacterium abundance and distribution in the environment. IMPORTANCE Despite the plummeting costs of sequencing, characterizing the fine-scale genetic diversity of a microbial community-and interpreting its functional importance-remains a challenge. Indeed, most studies, particularly studies of soil, assess community composition at a broad genetic level by classifying diversity into taxa (OTUs) defined by 16S rRNA sequence similarity. However, these classifications potentially obscure variation in traits that result in fine-scale ecological differentiation among closely related strains. Here, we investigated microdiversity in a highly diverse and poorly characterized soil system (leaf litter in a southern Californian grassland). We focused on the most abundant bacterium, Curtobacterium, which by standard methods is grouped into only one OTU. We find that the degree of carbohydrate usage and temperature preference vary within the OTU, whereas its responses to changes in precipitation are relatively uniform. These results suggest that microdiversity may be key to understanding how soil bacterial diversity is linked to ecosystem functioning.","2017","8","10.1128/mBio.01809-17","me","not yet"

Knowledge on the abundance and diversity of human-associated archaea is extremely limited, and little is known about their function(s), their overall role in human health, or their association with parts of the human body other than the gastrointestinal tract and oral cavity. Currently, methodological issues impede the full assessment of the human archaeome, as bacteria-targeting protocols are unsuitable for characterization of the full spectrum of Archaea. The goal of this study was to establish conservative protocols based on specifically archaea-targeting, PCR-based methods to retrieve first insights into the archaeomes of the human gastrointestinal tract, lung, nose, and skin. Detection of Archaea was highly dependent on primer selection and the sequence processing pipeline used. Our results enabled us to retrieve a novel picture of the human archaeome, as we found for the first time Methanobacterium and Woesearchaeota (DPANN superphylum) to be associated with the human gastrointestinal tract and the human lung, respectively. Similar to bacteria, human-associated archaeal communities were found to group biogeographically, forming (i) the thaumarchaeal skin landscape, (ii) the (methano) euryarchaeal gastrointestinal tract, (iii) a mixed skin-gastrointestinal tract landscape for the nose, and (iv) a woesearchaeal lung landscape. On the basis of the protocols we used, we were able to detect unexpectedly high diversity of archaea associated with different body parts. IMPORTANCE In summary, our study highlights the importance of the primers and NGS data processing pipeline used to study the human archaeome. We were able to establish protocols that revealed the presence of previously undetected Archaea in all of the tissue samples investigated and to detect biogeographic patterns of the human archaeome in the gastrointestinal tract, on the skin, and for the first time in the respiratory tract, i.e., the nose and lungs. Our results are a solid basis for further investigation of the human archaeome and, in the long term, discovery of the potential role of archaea in human health and disease.","2017","8","10.1128/mBio.00824-17","me","not yet"

We analyzed environmental DNA from 150 geo-referenced grassland plots representing topographical and land-use ranges typical for Central Europe. High through-put barcoding allowed the identification of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at species level, with high pairwise identity to reference sequences (>= 99.7%), but also the identification of sequences at the genus (>= 97%) and class (>= 80%) taxonomic level.

Database shortfalls were highlighted by increased uncertain taxonomic lineages at lower resolution (>= 80% sequence identity). No single barcode occurred ubiquitously across all sites. Taxa-area relationships indicated that OTUs spread over the entire mesoscale were more similar than in the local scale and increased land-use (fertilization, mowing and grazing) promoted taxa-area separation.

Testate amoebae on the Antarctic Peninsula (AP) are well-documented and variations in their population size have recently been interpreted as a proxy for microbial productivity changes in response to recent regional climate change. AP testate amoeba assemblages are dominated by a small number of globally ubiquitous taxa. We examine morphological variation in Corythion spp. across the AP, finding clear evidence supporting the presence of two morphospecies. Corythion constricta (Certes 1889) was identified on the AP for the first time and has potentially been previously misidentified. Furthermore, a southerly trend of decreasing average test size in Corythion dubium (Taranek 1881) along the AP suggests adaptive polymorphism, although the precise drivers of this remain unclear, with analysis hindered by limited environmental data. Further work into morphological variation in Corythion is needed elsewhere, alongside molecular analyses, to evaluate the potential for (pseudo)cryptic diversity within the genus.

Few investigations have been reported on spatial variation of microbial community composition in response to fertilizations in agroecosystems at a large scale. To improve the related understandings, we have evaluated the taxonomic and phylogenetic diversities of bacterial taxa in response to three fertilization strategies in six paddy experiment sites spanning across subtropical China. We found the large-scale compositional variation of paddy bacterial community is shaped by both geographic location and environmental selection, and the former is the dominant factor. The slopes of distance-decay relationships (DDR) are flattened by fertilizations, NPK (mineral NPK fertilizers) and OM (mineral NPK fertilizers plus organic amendments) when compared to Control. A flattened DDR implies that bacterial community composition is greatly homogenized by fertilizations in paddies. It is also inferred that fertilization decreases sensitivity of bacterial community to geographic and environmental factors, which is speculated to be beneficial for agroecosystem stability and yield sustainability. Results from this investigation correlate microscopic agroecosystem with macroscopic agricultural practices. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The specificity of rhizobia-legume associations means that underused legume species may depend on seed inoculation with their rhizobial partners. For black medic (Medicago lupulina) and lucerne (Medicago sativa) little is known about the natural prevalence of their rhizobial partner Ensifer meliloti in UK soils, so that the need for inoculating them is unclear. We analysed the site-dependence of rhizobial seed inoculation effects on the subsequent ability of rhizobial communities to form symbioses with four legume species (Medicago lupulina, M. sativa, Trifolium repens and T. pratense). At ten organic farms across the UK, a species-diverse legume based mixture (LBM) which included these four species was grown. The LBM seed was inoculated with a mix of commercial inocula specific for clover and lucerne. At each site, soil from the LBM treatment was compared to the soil sampled prior to the sowing of the LBM (the control). From each site and each of the two treatments, a suspension of soils was applied to seedlings of the four legume species and grown in axenic conditions for six weeks. Root nodules were counted and their rhizobia isolated. PCR and sequencing of a fragment of the gyrB gene from rhizobial isolates allowed identification of strains. The number of nodules on each of the four legume species was significantly increased when inoculated with soil from the LBM treatment compared to the control. Both the proportion of plants forming nodules and the number of nodules formed varied significantly by site, with sites significantly affecting the Medicago species but not the Trifolium species. These differences in nodulation were broadly reflected in plant biomass where site and treatment interacted; at some sites there was a significant advantage from inoculation with the commercial inoculum but not at others. In particular, this study has demonstrated the commercial merit of inoculation of lucerne with compatible rhizobia.","2017","120","10.1016/j.apsoil.2017.06.030","me","not yet"

An increasing amount of taxonomic data on soil microbial community composition along elevation gradients have been collected, however the trophic patterns and environmental drivers of elevational changes remain largely unclear. Here, we examined the distribution patterns of major soil bacterial and fungal taxa along the northern slope of Changbai Mountain, Northeast China, at five typical vegetation types located between 740 and 2,691 m above sea level. Elevational patterns of the relative abundance of specific microbial taxa could be partially explained by the oligotrophic-copiotrophic theory. Specifically, two dark-coniferous forests, located at mid-elevation sites, were considered to be oligotrophic habitats, with relatively higher soil C/N ratio and NH4+-N concentrations. As expected, oligotrophic microbial taxa, belonging to the bacterial phyla Acidobacteria and Gemmatimonadetes, and fungal phylum Basidiomycota, were predominant in the two dark-coniferous forests, exhibiting a mid-elevation maximum pattern. In contrast, the broad leaf-Korean pine mixed forest located at the foot of the mountain, Betula ermanii-dominated forest located below the tree line, and alpine tundra at the highest elevation were considered more copiotrophic habitats, characterized by higher substrate-induced-respiration rates and NO3--N concentrations. Microbial taxa considered to be so called copiotrophic members, such as bacterial phyla Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria, and fungal phylum Ascomycota, were relatively abundant in these locations, resulting in a mid-elevation minimum pattern. At finer taxonomic levels, the two most abundant proteobacterial classes, alpha-and beta-Proteobacteria, along with Acidobacteria Gp1, 2, 3, 15, and the Basidiomycotal class of Tremellomycetes were classified with the copiotrophic group. Gamma-and delta-Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria Gp4, 6, 7, 16, and Basidiomycotal class of Agaricomycetes were classified as oligotrophic taxa. This work uses the oligotrophic-copiotrophic theory to explain the elevational distribution pattern of the relative abundance of specific microbial taxa, confirming some of the existing trophic classifications of microbial taxa and expanding on the theory to include a broader range of taxonomic levels.","2017","8","10.3389/fmicb.2017.02071","me","not yet"

These interactions are thought to influence microbial succession, community stability, syntrophic relationships, and resiliency in the face of perturbations. The complexity and dynamism of the gut microbiota pose considerable challenges for quantitative analysis of its spatial organization. Here, we illustrate an approach for addressing this challenge, using (i) a model, defined 15-member consortium of phylogenetically diverse, sequenced human gut bacterial strains introduced into adult gnotobiotic mice fed a polysaccharide-rich diet, and (ii) in situ hybridization and spectral imaging analysis methods that allow simultaneous detection of multiple bacterial strains at multiple spatial scales. Differences in the binding affinities of strains for substrates such as mucus or food particles, combined with more rapid replication in a preferred microhabitat, could, in principle, lead to localized clonally expanded aggregates composed of one or a few taxa. However, our results reveal a colonic community that is mixed at micrometer scales, with distinct spatial distributions of some taxa relative to one another, notably at the border between the mucosa and the lumen. Our data suggest that lumen and mucosa in the proximal colon should be conceptualized not as stratified compartments but as components of an incompletely mixed bioreactor. Employing the experimental approaches described should allow direct tests of whether and how specified host and microbial factors influence the nature and functional contributions of microscale mixing to the dynamic operations of the microbiota in health and disease.","2017","114","10.1073/pnas.1711596114","me","not yet"

Next generation sequencing reveals a bacterial community profile that is distinct among BSCs in the southwestern United States. Distribution of major phyla in the BSC topsoils included Cyanobacteria (33 +/- 8%), Proteobacteria (26 +/- 6%), and Chloroflexi (12 +/- 4%), with Phormidium being the numerically dominant genus. Furthermore, BSC subsurfaces contained Proteobacteria (23 +/- 5%), Actinobacteria (20 +/- 5%), and Chloroflexi (18 +/- 3%), with an unidentified genus from Chloroflexi (AKIW781, order) being numerically dominant. Across the transect, changes in distribution at the phylum (p < 0.0439) and genus (p < 0.006) levels, including multiple biochemical and geochemical trends (p < 0.05), positively correlated with increasing BSC surface coverage.

The overall objectives of this study were i) to describe the bacterial taxonomic richness variations across France, ii) to identify the ecological processes (i.e. selection by the environment and dispersal limitation) influencing this distribution, and iii) to develop a statistical predictive model of soil bacterial richness. We used the French Soil Quality Monitoring Network (RMQS), which covers all of France with 2,173 sites. The soil bacterial richness (i. e. OTU number) was determined by pyrosequencing 16S rRNA genes and related to the soil characteristics, climatic conditions, geomorphology, land use and space. Mapping of bacterial richness revealed a heterogeneous spatial distribution, structured into patches of about 111km, where the main drivers were the soil physico-chemical properties (18% of explained variance), the spatial descriptors (5.25%, 1.89% and 1.02% for the fine, medium and coarse scales, respectively), and the land use (1.4%). Based on these drivers, a predictive model was developed, which allows a good prediction of the bacterial richness (R-adj(2) of 0.56) and provides a reference value for a given pedoclimatic condition.","2017","12","10.1371/journal.pone.0186766","me","not yet"

The sequence analysis showed the existence of 1006 +/- 8.9 and 60.6 +/- 3.1 operational taxonomic unit (OTUs) for bacterial and fungal communities respectively. In fungal communities, five major phyla were found with significantly higher abundance of Ascomycota (60.3%) in wild population and Basidiomycota (52%) in cultivated tree rhizospheres. Among bacterial communities, 31 major phyla were found, with significant distribution of Actinobacteria in wild tree rhizospheres, whereas Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria were highly abundant in cultivated trees. The diversity and abundance of microbiome varied significantly depending upon soil characteristics of the three different populations. In addition, significantly higher glucosidases, cellulases and indole-3-acetic acid were found in cultivated trees rhizospheres as compared to wild tree populations. for these plants to survive the harsh arid-land environmental conditions.

Yet, the role of the environment, including biotic forces such as microbial and insect communities, in contributing to crop phenotypes under domestication and diversification has been poorly explored. In particular, there has been limited progress in understanding how human selection, agricultural cultivation (soil disturbance, fertilization, and irrigation), and biotic forces act as selective pressures on crop phenotypes. For example, geographically-structured pathogenic, pestiferous, and mutualistic interactions with crop plants have likely given rise to landraces that interact differently with local microbial and insect communities. In order to understand the adaptive role of crop traits, we argue that more studies should be conducted in the geographic centers of origin to test hypotheses on how abiotic, biotic, and human selective forces have shaped the phenotypes of domesticated plants during crop domestication and subsequent diversification into landraces. In these centers of origin, locally endemic species associated with wild ancestors have likely contributed to the selection on plant phenotypes. We address a range of questions that can only be studied in the geographic center of crop origin, placing emphasis on Mesoamerican polyculture systems, and highlight the significance of in situ studies for increasing the sustainability of modern agricultural systems.","2017","5","10.3389/fevo.2017.00125","me","not yet"
"Hoetzinger, M; Hahn, MW","Genomic divergence and cohesion in a species of pelagic freshwater bacteria","BMC GENOMICS","Background: In many prokaryotic genera a clustered phylogeny is observed, akin to the occurrence of species in sexually reproducing organisms. For some taxa, homologous recombination has been invoked as the underlying mechanism providing genomic cohesion among conspecific individuals. Whether this mechanism is applicable to prokaryotes in freshwaters with low habitat connectivity - i.e. elevated geographic barriers to gene flow - is unclear. To investigate further we studied genomic trends within the globally abundant PnecC cluster (genus Polynucleobacter, Betaproteobacteria) and analyzed homologous recombination within the affiliated species P. asymbioticus. Results: Comparisons among 20 PnecC genomes revealed a clearly discontinuous distribution of nucleotide sequence similarities. Among the nine conspecific individuals (P. asymbioticus) all average nucleotide identity (ANI) values were greater than 97%, whereas all other comparisons exhibited ANI values lower than 85%. The reconstruction of recombination and mutation events for the P. asymbioticus core genomes yielded an r/m ratio of 7.4, which is clearly above estimated thresholds for recombination to act as a cohesive force. Hotspots of recombination were found to be located in the flanking regions of genomic islands. Even between geographically separated habitats a high flux of recombination was evident. While a biogeographic population structure was suggested from MLST data targeting rather conserved loci, such a structure was barely visible when whole genome data was considered. However, both MLST and whole genome data showed evidence of differentiation between two lineages of P. asymbioticus. The ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates as well as growth rates in transplantation experiments suggested that this divergence was not selectively neutral. Conclusions: The high extent of homologous recombination among P. asymbioticus bacteria can act as a cohesive force that effectively counteracts genetic divergence. At least on a regional scale, homologous recombination can act across geographically separated ecosystems and therefore plays an important role in the evolution and consistency of bacterial freshwater species. A species model akin to the biological species concept may be applicable for P. asymbioticus. Nonetheless, two genetically distinct lineages have emerged and further research may clarify if their divergence has been initiated by reinforced geographical barriers or has been evolving in sympatry.","2017","18","10.1186/s12864-017-4199-z","me","not yet"

To accurately and reliably identify the parameters of different PV models, an improved JAYA (IJAYA) optimization algorithm is proposed in the paper. In IJAYA, a self-adaptive weight is introduced to adjust the tendency of approaching the best solution and avoiding the worst solution at different search stages, which enables the algorithm to approach the promising area at the early stage and implement the local search at the later stage. Furthermore, an experience-based learning strategy is developed and employed randomly to maintain the population diversity and enhance the exploration ability. A chaotic elite learning method is proposed to refine the quality of the best solution in each generation. The proposed IJAYA is used to solve the parameters identification problems of different PV models, i.e., single diode, double diode, and PV module. Comprehensive experiment results and analyses indicate that IJAYA can obtain a highly competitive performance compared with other state-of-the-state algorithms, especially in terms of accuracy and reliability.","2017","150","10.1016/j.enconman.2017.08.063","me","not yet"

Little is known about the relative importance of the processes that drive planktonic and benthic microeukaryotic biogeography in subtropical offshore areas. This study compares the microeukaryotic community compositions (MCCs) from offshore waters (n = 12) and intertidal sediments (n = 12) around Xiamen Island, southern China, using high-throughput sequencing of 18S rDNA. This work further quantifies the relative contributions of spatial and environmental variables on the distribution of marine MCCs (including total, dominant, rare and conditionally rare taxa). Our results showed that planktonic and benthic MCCs were significantly different, and the benthic richness (6627 OTUs) was much higher than that for plankton (4044 OTUs) with the same sequencing effort. Further, we found that benthic MCCs exhibited a significant distance-decay relationship, whereas the planktonic communities did not. After removing two unique sites (N2 and N3), however, 72% variation in planktonic community was explained well by stochastic processes. More importantly, both the environmental and spatial factors played significant roles in influencing the biogeography of total and dominant planktonic and benthic microeukaryotic communities, although their relative effects on these community variations were different. However, a high proportion of unexplained variation in the rare taxa (78.1-97.4%) and conditionally rare taxa (49.0-81.0%) indicated that more complex mechanisms may influence the assembly of the rare subcommunity. These results demonstrate that patterns and processes in marine microeukaryotic community assembly differ among the different habitats (coastal water vs. intertidal sediment) and different communities (total, dominant, rare and conditionally rare microeukaryotes), and provide novel insight on the microeukaryotic biogeography and ecological mechanisms in coastal waters and intertidal sediments at local scale.","2017","8","10.3389/fmicb.2017.01912","me","not yet"

Most of the work investigating microbial biogeography has been site-specific, and logical environmental factors, rather than geographical location, may be more influential on microbial diversity. SEQenv, a novel pipeline aiming to provide environmental annotations of sequences emerged to provide a consistent description of the environmental niches using the ENVO ontology. While the pipeline provides a list of environmental terms on the basis of sample datasets and, therefore, the annotations obtained are at the dataset level, it lacks a taxa centric approach to environmental annotation. The work here describes an extension developed to enhance the SEQenv pipeline, which provided the means to directly generate environmental annotations for taxa under different contexts. 16S rDNA amplicon datasets belonging to distinct biomes were selected to illustrate the applicability of the extended SEQenv pipeline. A literature survey of the results demonstrates the immense importance of sequence level environmental annotations by illustrating the distribution of both taxa across environments as well as the various environmental sources of a specific taxon. Significantly enhancing the SEQenv pipeline in the process, this information would be valuable to any biologist seeking to understand the various taxa present in the habitat and the environment they originated from, enabling a more thorough analysis of which lineages are abundant in certain habitats and the recovery of patterns in taxon distribution across different habitats and environmental gradients.","2017","5","10.7717/peerj.3827","me","not yet"

We previously studied the bacterial communities found in households located throughout Hong Kong as well as the skin surfaces of the occupants. As a complementary study, here, we investigated the fungal communities (mycobiome) in the same residences and occupants and identified factors that are important in shaping their diversity, composition, distribution, and dispersal patterns. Results: We observed that common skin and environmental fungal taxa dominated air, surface, and skin samples. Individual and touch frequency strongly and respectively shaped the fungal community structure on occupant skin and residential surfaces. Cross-domain analysis revealed positive correlations between bacterial and fungal community diversity and composition, especially for skin samples. SourceTracker prediction suggested that some fungi can be transferred bidirectionally between surfaces and skin sites, but bacteria showed a stronger dispersal potential. In addition, we detected a modest but significant association between indoor airborne bacterial composition and geographic distance on a city-wide scale, a pattern not observed for fungi. However, the distance-decay effects were more pronounced at shorter local scale for both communities, and airflow might play a prominent role in driving the spatial variation of the indoor airborne mycobiome. Conclusions: Our study suggests that occupants exert a weaker influence on surface fungal communities compared to bacterial communities, and local environmental factors, including air currents, appear to be stronger determinants of indoor airborne mycobiome than ventilation strategy, human occupancy, and room type.","2017","5","10.1186/s40168-017-0346-7","me","not yet"

Anthropogenic activities, including wastewater discharge and river damming, raise adverse impacts on ecosystem and continuum of rivers. An increasing amount of attention has been paid to riverine bacterioplankton as they make vital contributions to biogeochemical nutrient cycle. A comprehensive study was conducted on the bacterioplankton community along the Yarlung Tsangpo River, which is the longest plateau river in China and is suffering from various anthropogenic impacts. The results indicated that nutrient variations corresponded to anthropogenic activities, and silica, nitrogen and phosphorus were retained by the dam. River damming influenced the biomass and diversity of the bacterioplankton, but significant alterations in the community structure were not observed between upstream and downstream of the dam. Moreover, the spatial distribution of the bacterioplankton community changed gradually along the river, and the dominant bacterioplankton in the upstream, midstream and downstream portions of the river were Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria, respectively. Soluble reactive phosphorus, elevation, ammonium nitrogen, velocity and turbidity were the main environmental factors that shape the bacterioplankton community.

They are also of interest in the study of the function and evolution of their mitochondrion-related organelle, the hydrogenosome. The taxonomy and phylogeny of this group remains confused, due, in large part, to the fact that most of its taxa have not been characterized by modern methods including molecular sequencing. In this report we provide morphologic and molecular characterization of seven taxa from the poorly-known resurrected genus Urostomides obtained in the course of broad geographic sampling. Foissner (2016) established the family Apometopidae to include Apometopus (a junior synonym of Urostomides) and Cirranter Jankowski, 1964. These two genera differ from all other metopid genera in having a four-rowed perizonal ciliary stripe, the only currently recognizable morphologic synapomorphy for the family. The members of Urostomides show remarkable morphologic diversity. The genus has a broad geographic distribution, occurring on six continents. Urostomides species form a strongly supported clade in phylogenetic analyses. Relationships within the genus itself are less clearly resolved.

We examined controls on biogeographical patterns of Aridisol prokaryotic (bacterial and archaeal) communities at a regional scale by comparing communities from 100 Aridisols throughout the southwestern United States using high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. We found that microbial communities differed among global biomes and deserts of the Southwest. Differences among biomes were driven by differences in taxonomic identities, whereas differences among deserts of the Southwest were driven by differences in relative sequence abundance. Desert communities were dominated by Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria and Crenarchaeota, supporting the notion of a core set of abundant taxa in desert soils. Our findings contrast with studies showing little taxonomic overlap at the OTU level (97% sequence similarity) across large spatial scales, as we found similar to 90% of taxa in at least two of the three deserts. Geographic distance structured prokaryotic communities indirectly through the influence of climate and soil properties. Structural equation modeling suggests that climate exerts a stronger influence than soil properties in shaping the composition of Aridisol microbial communities, with annual heat moisture index (an aridity metric) being the strongest climate driver. Annual heat moisture index was associated with decreased microbial diversity and richness. If the Desert Southwest becomes hotter and drier as predicted, these findings suggest that prokaryotic diversity and richness in Aridisols will decline.","2017","93","10.1093/femsec/fix116","me","not yet"
"Duarte, S; Cassio, F; Pascoal, C","Environmental drivers are more important for structuring fungal decomposer communities than the geographic distance between streams","LIMNETICA","One of the major challenges in microbial ecology is to unravel the mechanisms that operate at the spatial-temporal scales structuring microbial communities and how these communities respond to environmental change. It has been argued that the biogeography of microorganisms solely reflects the influence of contemporary environmental variation and everything is everywhere. Since the discovery of the key role that decomposer fungi, in particular aquatic hyphomycetes, play in leaf-litter decomposition in streams, mycologists were interested in deciphering several ecological aspects, including the factors that shape the distribution of these communities in streams. At local and regional scales, community structure is affected by several abiotic factors such as pH, temperature, conductivity and nutrients in the stream water, but at a global scale, community similarity also decreases as a function of the geographic distance. However, very few attempts have been conducted to assess the relative influence of environmental versus geographic factors in structuring decomposer fungi in streams. In the current study, we attempted to fulfil this lacuna by quantifying the relative contributions of environmental factors versus spatial factors to community composition, by using data of species composition and environmental (temperature, pH, conductivity and nutrient concentrations) and spatial variables (latitude, longitude and altitude), collected during a recent extensive literature search. Alfa diversity was negatively affected by pH, conductivity, nitrates and phosphorus concentrations in the stream water. On the other hand, a unimodal type relationship was found between species richness and temperature, latitude or altitude. Beta-diversity was also strongly influenced by environmental factors, in particular conductivity, nitrates and phosphorus concentrations, and pH in stream water, but also by the geographic location (latitude and longitude) of the study sites. However, when the effects were disentangled a significant effect was found only for environmental variables. This suggests that stream dwelling decomposer fungi may exhibit biogeographic patterns, but as proposed by Baas-Becking the environment selects and is in part responsible for the spatial variation of stream-dwelling decomposer fungi. However, our conclusions should be taken cautiously because our data were extracted from the literature and reflect a geographical bias in the collection effort. Thus, future investigations should involve broad-scale coordinated surveys, incorporating a larger number of streams in different latitudinal bands and along large environmental gradients, to better assess the relative importance of environmental and geographical factors in structuring fungal communities in streams.","2017","36","10.23818/limn.36.17","me","not yet"

These unicellular forms are commonly found in aquatic environments, and their hyperdiversity may be the result of frequent inundation combined with numerous aquatic microenvironments in these rainforests. Other fungi that are frequent in aquatic environments, such as the abundant Chytridiomycotina, were also detected. While there was low similarity in OTU composition within and between the three rainforests, the fungal communities in Central America were more similar to each other than the communities in South America, reflecting a general biogeographic pattern also seen in animals, plants and protists.","2017","9","10.1111/1758-2229.12575","me","not yet"

These guanidinium groups confer high biological activity with high affinity and ion flux blockage capacity for voltage-gated sodium channels (Na-V). Members of the STX group, known collectively as paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs), are produced among three genera of marine dinoflagellates and about a dozen genera of primarily freshwater or brackish water cyanobacteria. In contrast, toxins of the TTX group occur mainly in macrozoa, particularly among puffer fish, several species of marine invertebrates and a few terrestrial amphibians. In the case of TTX and analogs, most evidence suggests that symbiotic bacteria are the origin of the toxins, although endogenous biosynthesis independent from bacteria has not been excluded. The evolutionary origin of the biosynthetic genes for STX and analogs in dinoflagellates and cyanobacteria remains elusive. These highly potent molecules have been the subject of intensive research since the latter half of the past century; first to study the mode of action of their toxigenicity, and later as tools to characterize the role and structure of Na-V channels, and finally as therapeutics. Their pharmacological activities have provided encouragement for their use as therapeutants for ion channel-related pathologies, such as pain control. The functional role in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems for both groups of toxins is unproven, although plausible mechanisms of ion channel regulation and chemical defense are often invoked. Molecular approaches and the development of improved detection methods will yield deeper understanding of their physiological and ecological roles. This knowledge will facilitate their further biotechnological exploitation and point the way towards development of pharmaceuticals and therapeutic applications.","2017","15","10.3390/md15100303","me","not yet"

Large-scale sequencing of environmental microbiomes has the potential to shed light on the richness of bacterial biosynthetic diversity hidden in the environment, how it varies from one environment to the next, and what environmental factors correlate with changes in biosynthetic diversity. In this study, the sequencing of PCR amplicons generated using primers targeting either ketosynthase domains from polyketide biosynthesis or adenylation domains from nonribosomal peptide biosynthesis was used to assess biosynthetic domain composition and richness in soils collected across the Australian continent. Using environmental variables collected at each soil site, we looked for environmental factors that correlated with either high overall domain richness or changes in the domain composition. Among the environmental variables we measured, changes in biosynthetic domain composition correlate most closely with changes in latitude and to a lesser extent changes in pH. Although it is unclear at this time the exact mix of factors that may drive the relationship between biosynthetic domain composition and latitude, from a practical perspective the identification of a latitudinal basis for differences in soil metagenome biosynthetic domain compositions should help guide future natural product discovery efforts.","2017","114","10.1073/pnas.1710262114","me","not yet"

However, the drivers of microbial diversity are complex and the pathways of these drivers effects are to date largely unresolved, especially in freshwaters. We disentangled the causal direct and indirect effects of climate, land cover and water chemistry on stream diatom communities using hierarchical settings. Location: Finland, a geographical gradient of c. 1200 km (60 degrees-70 degrees N). Methods: We used structural equation modelling (SEM) to analyse patterns in diatom richness, composition and the uniqueness of species composition in 143 streams. The community composition was defined as the value of the first axis in non-metric multidimensional scaling and the uniqueness of species composition of each site as its local contribution to beta diversity. Results: Species richness was mainly affected directly by energy and resource availability, increasing with nutrients but decreasing with growing degree days (GDD). The community composition was strongly influenced directly by conductivity and mainly indirectly by anthropogenic land use but also to a lesser degree by GDD (directly and indirectly), indirectly by precipitation and directly by the amount of boreal wetlands. The uniqueness of species composition increased with conductivity but decreased with nutrient concentrations with high number of unique species in southernmost and northernmost sites. Main conclusions: Our SEM analyses revealed some of the important links between climate, land cover and water chemistry, all of which influenced the microbial diversity. Energy availability has varying indirect and direct effects on diatom communities regardless of local stream conditions, whereas land cover patterns affect aquatic communities most likely indirectly through water chemistry. Collectively, these results suggest that it is important to consider environmental variables simultaneously at different hierarchically ordered scales in macroecological and biogeographical research.","2017","44","10.1111/jbi.13046","me","not yet"

We highlighted the main factors responsible for major AMF community shifts and documented specific distribution patterns for each AMF species. AMF spores were morphologically identified and counted for each species. In total, 17,924 spores were classified and 106 AMF species were identified. In general, AMF species richness (SR) was higher in grasslands than in croplands. In croplands, SR increased with altitude but this trend was not observed in grasslands. Some species occurred at virtually all sites, while others were rarely detected, and for others, species-specific distribution patterns were revealed. Some species were affected by land use type or intensity, or related factors like soil organic matter, soil microbial biomass and respiration or nutrient availability. Other species were more affected by soil pH and related parameters like base saturation and carbonate contents, by soil texture, or by altitude, or by a combination of two to several of all these parameters. We conclude that a high number of AMF species may serve as indicator species for specific habitats and land use. These species might deliver certain ecosystem services at their habitats and deserve further investigation about their functional diversity.","2017","53","10.1007/s00374-017-1217-x","me","not yet"

Therefore, in this study, we investigated bacterial and fungal diversity in solar greenhouse soils covering a wide range of cultivation year (CY) and sampling site (SS), by using pyrosequencing technology. Surprisingly, CY and SS had little influence on bacterial and fungal relative abundance and diversity. However, environmental factors (EF) and soil available potassium (K) in particular made a significant contribution to the variation of soil bacterial and fungal communities. Specifically, K showed significant (P < 0.05) correlations with dominant bacterial phyla Bacteroidetes, Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Planctomycetes and fungal phyla Ascomycota and Basidiomycota.

The objective of this study was to investigate how landscape connectivity and dispersal impacts microbial diversity in an agricultural-dominated watershed. We characterized soil, sediment and water microbial communities along the Upper Sangamon River basin in Illinois-a 3600 km(2) watershed strongly influenced by human activity, especially landscape modification and extensive fertilization for agriculture. We employed statistical and network analyses to reveal the microbial community structure and interactions in the critical zone (water, soil and sediment media). Using a Bayesian source tracking approach, we predicted microbial community connectivity within and between the environments. We identified strong connectivity within environments (up to 85.4 +/- 13.3% of sequences in downstream water samples sourced from upstream samples, and 44.7 +/- 26.6% in soil and sediment samples), but negligible connectivity across environments, which indicates that microbial dispersal was successful within but not between environments. Species sorting based on sample media type and environmental parameters was the dominant driver of community dissimilarity. Finally, we constructed operational taxonomic unit association networks for each environment and identified a number of co-occurrence relationships that were shared between habitats, suggesting that these are likely to be ecologically significant.","2017","93","10.1093/femsec/fix120","me","not yet"
"Zorzal-Almeida, S; Bini, LM; Bicudo, DC","Beta diversity of diatoms is driven by environmental heterogeneity, spatial extent and productivity","HYDROBIOLOGIA","Simultaneous effects of productivity, environmental heterogeneity and spatial extent on beta diversity of microbial communities have seldom been investigated. Here, we evaluated how these components are related to diatom beta diversity in tropical reservoirs. We hypothesised positive relationships between diatom beta diversity and environmental heterogeneity, productivity and spatial extent. Regression models were used to model beta diversity as a function of different measures of abiotic environmental heterogeneity, productivity, reservoir morphology, spatial extent, and habitat heterogeneity. Our results suggest a strong relationship between beta diversity and environmental heterogeneity, productivity and spatial extent. However, contrary to our hypothesis, productivity was negatively related to beta diversity. We speculate that artificial eutrophication can lead to decreased beta diversity (biotic homogenisation). Furthermore, the relationship between beta diversity and abiotic environmental heterogeneity depends how this component was measured. In conclusion, environmental heterogeneity and dispersal limitation were likely the main factors that determined diatom beta diversity in tropical reservoirs.","2017","800","10.1007/s10750-017-3117-3","me","not yet"

Here, planktonic ciliates were sampled from shallow lakes of four Neotropical floodplains, distributed over a spatial extent of ca. 3000 km, during high and low water periods, along with several abiotic and biotic variables potentially affecting the ciliate community. We found that common ciliate species were more associated with environmental gradients and rare species were more related to spatial variables; however, this pattern seemed to change depending on the temporal and spatial scales considered. Environmental gradients were more important in the high waters for both common and rare species. In low waters, common species continued to be mainly driven by environmental conditions, but rare species were more associated with the spatial component, suggesting dispersal limitation likely due to differences in dispersal ability and ecological tolerance of species. We also found that common and rare species were related to different environmental variables, suggesting different ecological niches. At the largest spatial extents, rare species showed clear biogeographic patterns.","2017","74","10.1007/s00248-017-0974-2","me","not yet"

In this study, we investigated the biogeographic assemblies and ecological diversity patterns of rare and abundant bacteria in long-term oil-contaminated soils at intervals of 46-360km by performing high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA genes. The results clearly revealed distinct distribution patterns for rare and abundant bacteria in soil samples. Rare taxa were unevenly distributed; however, abundant taxa were ubiquitous across all samples. Both rare and abundant subcommunities showed significant distance-decay relationships, and their assemblies were driven by different factors. The rare subcommunity primarily exhibited a spatially structured distribution (i.e., stochastic processes), while edaphic factors (i.e., deterministic processes) largely contributed to the structure of the abundant subcommunity. A network analysis revealed closer relationships between abundant bacteria and their heightened influence on other co-occurrences in the community compared with rare species. In conclusion, rare microbial taxa may play potential roles in maintaining ecosystem diversity, although they do not appear to be central to microbial networks. Abundant microbes are vital for microbial co-occurrences in oil-contaminated soils, and high relative abundance and ubiquitous distribution suggest potential roles in the degradation of organic pollutants.","2017","26","10.1111/mec.14218","me","not yet"

The ability to establish this partnership has been lost in some plant lineages like the Brassicaceae, which raises the question of what alternative nutrition strategies such plants have to grow in P-impoverished soils. To understand the contribution of plant-micro biota interactions, we studied the root-associated fungal microbiome of Arabis alpina (Brassicaceae) with the hypothesis that some of its components can promote plant P acquisition. Using amplicon sequenc ing of the fungal internal transcribed spacer 2, we studied the root and rhizosphere fungal communities of A. alpina growing under natural and controlled conditions including low-P soils and identified a set of 15 fungal taxa consistently detected in its roots. This cohort included a Helotiales taxon exhibiting high abundance in roots of wild A. alpina growing in an extremely P-limited soil. Consequently, we isolated and subsequently reintroduced a specimen from this taxon into its native P-poor soil in which it improved plant growth and P uptake. The fungus exhibited mycorrhiza-like traits including colonization of the root endosphere and P transfer to the plant Genome analysis revealed a link between its endophytic lifestyle and the expansion of its repertoire of carbohydrate-active enzymes. We report the discovery of a plant- fungus interaction facilitating the growth of a nonmycorrhizal plant under native P-limited conditions, thus uncovering a previously underestimated role of root fungal microbiota in P cycling.","2017","114","10.1073/pnas.1710455114","me","not yet"

Here, we investigated bacterial distribution in bulk soil, loosely- and tightly-bound soils, from wheat fields distributed across 800,000 km(2) of the North China Plain. Bacterial community composition differed dramatically among bulk and rhizospheric soils, and bacterial diversity decreased with the root proximity. Soil pH correlated with bacterial community composition and diversity in three compartments. Bacterial community in tightly bound soil formed a hub-based network topology with higher transitivity and greater number of central nodes compared with loosely bound and bulk soils, potentially as a result of more direct ecological interactions between the members of the tightly bound soil compartment. Bulk and rhizospheric soils maintained similar compositional distance decay patterns (with equal decay rates), but distinct phylogenetic distance decay patterns (with steeper slope of tightly bound soil). Geographical distance described a relatively greater proportion of bacterial spatial distribution in tightly bound soil, compared with loosely bound soil and bulk soil. Deterministic processes dominated the assemblage of bacterial communities in all soil compartments, while phylogenetic clustering was weaker in tightly bound soil. Taken together, our results suggest distinct bacterial network structure and distribution patterns among bulk soil, loosely bound soil and tightly bound rhizospheric soil, which could possibly result in potential functional differentiation.

We provide a continental-scale assessment of dominant reef habitats through analysis of macroalgae and sessile animal taxa at sites distributed around Australia. Relationships between reef habitats and environmental and anthropogenic factors are assessed, and potential changes in the future distribution and persistence of habitats are considered. LocationShallow rocky and coral reefs around the Australian coast. MethodsCover of 38 sessile biota functional groups was recorded in diver-based surveys using quadrats at 1,299 sites. Classification analyses based on the functional groups were used to identify an unambiguous set of biogenic habitat types. Random forest and distance-based linear modelling were used to investigate correlations between these habitats and environmental and anthropogenic variables. ResultsCluster analyses revealed tropical and temperate realms in benthic substratum composition, each with finer-scale habitats: four for the temperate realm (canopy algae, barren, epiphytic algae-understorey and turf) and five for the tropical realm (coral, coral-bacterial mat, turf-coral, calcified algae-coral and foliose algae). Habitats were correlated with different sets of environmental and anthropogenic conditions, with key associations in the temperate realm between mean sea temperature and canopy-forming algae (negative) and barren habitat (positive). Variation in sea temperature was also an important correlate in the tropical realm. Main conclusionsQuantitative delineation of inshore reef habitats at a continental scale identifies many of the same habitat types traditionally recognized through subjective methods. Importantly, many biogenic reef habitats were closely related to environmental parameters and anthropogenic variables that are predicted to change. Consequently, habitats have differing likelihood of persistence. Structurally complex habitats in the temperate realm are at greater risk than more two-dimensional habitats (e.g., canopy-forming versus turfing algae). In the tropical realm, offshore and coastal habitats differed greatly, highlighting the importance of large-scale oceanic conditions in shaping biogenic structure.","2017","26","10.1111/geb.12620","me","not yet"

These coastal lagoons are characterized by the steep environmental gradient and provide an excellent model system to decipher the biotic and abiotic factors that determine the bacterial community structure over time and space. Using Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA genes from a total of 100 bulk surface sediments, we investigated the sedimentary bacterial communities, their spatiotemporal distribution, and compared them with the rhizosphere sediment communities of a common reed; Phragmites karka and a native seagrass species; Halodule uninervis in Chilika Lagoon. Spatiotemporal patterns in bacterial communities were linked to specific biotic factors (e.g., presence and type of macrophyte) and abiotic factors (e.g., salinity) that drove the community composition. Comparative assessment of communities highlighted bacterial lineages that were responsible for segregating the sediment communities over distinct salinity regimes, seasons, locations, and presence and type of macrophytes. Several bacterial taxa were specific to one of these ecological factors suggesting that species-sorting processes drive specific biogeographical patterns in the bacterial populations. Modeling of proteobacterial lineages against salinity gradient revealed that alpha- and gamma-Proteobacteria increased with salinity, whereas beta-Proteobacteria displayed the opposite trend. The wide variety of biogeochemical functions performed by the rhizosphere microbiota of P. karka must be taken into consideration while formulating the management and conservation plan for this reed. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics and functionality of sedimentary bacterial communities and highlighted the role of biotic and abiotic factors in generating the biogeographical patterns in the bacterial communities of a tropical brackish water coastal lagoon.

By using an Illumina MiSeq sequencing analysis, we assessed the compositions and diversity of bacterial and fungal community in soils of rubber plantation (or rubber forest, RF), secondary tropical forest (STF), and tropical seasonal rainforest (TSR) in Xishuangbanna, southwest China. Our findings revealed that (a) for bacterial composition, Bacillaceae was the most dominant family (13.60%) in RF soil, while it only accounted for 4.13% in STF and 6.92% in TSR. For fungal composition, the largest family in soils of RF was Basidiomycota_unclassified. However, the largest family in STF and TSR was Russulaceae. (b) Number of operational taxonomic units, Chao index, and Shannon index of bacterial community in soil of RF were significantly higher than those of TSR and STF. However, these diversity indices of fungal community in RF were significantly lower than those of TSR and STF. (c) Soil pH and total phosphorus were very important drivers for bacterial community, whereas soil organic matter and total nitrogen were the most important factors for fungal community. (d) The microbial biomass carbon in RF was relative lower than those in STF and TSR, which suggested that the total microbial biomass decreased after forest conversion.

However, how chemical factors control the distribution of Zetaproteobacteria and their co-occurring taxa remains elusive. Here we analysed iron mats from the Troll Wall Vent Field (TWVF) located at the Arctic Mid-Ocean Ridge (AMOR) in the Norwegian-Greenland Sea. The samples were taken at increasing distances from high-temperature venting chimneys towards areas with ultraslow low-temperature venting, encompassing a large variety in geochemical settings. Electron microscopy revealed the presence of biogenic iron stalks in all samples. Using 16S rRNA gene sequence profiling we found that relative abundances of Zetaproteobacteria in the iron mats varied from 0.2 to 37.9%. Biogeographic analyses of Zetaproteobacteria, using the ZetaHunter software, revealed the presence of ZetaOtus 1, 2 and 9, supporting the view that they are cosmopolitan. Relative abundances of co-occurring taxa, including Thaumarchaeota, Euryarchaeota and Proteobacteria, also varied substantially. From our results, combined with results from previous microbiological and geochemical analyses of the TWVF, we infer that the distribution of Zetaproteobacteria is connected to fluid-flow patterns and, ultimately, variations in chemical energy landscapes. Moreover, we provide evidence for iron-oxidizing members of Gallionellaceae being widespread in TWVF iron mats, albeit at low relative abundances.","2017","12","10.1371/journal.pone.0185008","me","not yet"

Future mining of these nodule fields is predicted to have substantial effects on biodiversity and physicochemical conditions in mined areas. Yet, the identity and distributions of bacterial populations in deep-sea sediments and associated polymetallic nodules has received relatively little attention. We examined bacterial communities using high-throughput sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA gene fragments from samples collected in the water column, sediment, and polymetallic nodules in the Pacific Ocean (bottom depth =4,000 m) in the eastern Clarion-Clipperton Zone. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs; defined at 99% 16S rRNA gene identity) affiliated with JTB255 (Gammaproteobacteria) and Rhodospirillaceae (Alphaproteobacteria) had higher relative abundances in the nodule and sediment habitats compared to the water column. Rhodobiaceae family and Vibrio OTUs had higher relative abundance in nodule samples, but were less abundant in sediment and water column samples. Bacterial communities in sediments and associated with nodules were generally similar; however, 5,861 and 6,827 OTUs found in the water column were retrieved from sediment and nodule habitats, respectively. Cyanobacterial OTUs clustering among Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus were detected in both sediments and nodules, with greater representation among nodule samples. Such results suggest that vertical export of typically abundant photic-zone microbes may be an important process in delivery of water column microorganisms to abyssal habitats, potentially influencing the structure and function of communities in polymetallic nodule fields.","2017","8","10.3389/fmicb.2017.01696","me","not yet"

We use field surveys and a common garden experiment to analyze bacterial communities in the rhizosphere of P. australis stands from native, introduced, and Gulf lineages to determine lineage-specific controls on rhizosphere bacteria. We show that within-lineage bacterial communities are similar, but are distinct among lineages, which is consistent with our results in a complementary common garden experiment. Introduced P. australis rhizosphere bacterial communities have lower abundances of pathways involved in antimicrobial biosynthesis and degradation, suggesting a lower exposure to enemy attack than native and Gulf lineages. However, lineage and not rhizosphere bacterial communities dictate individual plant growth in the common garden experiment.

"Danczak, RE; Johnston, MD; Kenah, C; Slattery, M; Wrighton, KC; Wilkins, MJ","Members of the Candidate Phyla Radiation are functionally differentiated by carbon- and nitrogen-cycling capabilities","MICROBIOME","Background: The Candidate Phyla Radiation (CPR) is a recently described expansion of the tree of life that represents more than 15% of all bacterial diversity and potentially contains over 70 different phyla. Despite this broad phylogenetic variation, these microorganisms appear to feature little functional diversity, with members generally characterized as obligate fermenters. Additionally, much of the data describing CPR phyla has been generated from a limited number of environments, constraining our knowledge of their functional roles and biogeographical distribution. To expand our understanding of subsurface CPR microorganisms, we sampled four separate groundwater wells over 2 years across three Ohio counties. Results: Samples were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene amplicon and shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Amplicon results indicated that CPR members comprised between 2 and 20% of the microbial communities with relative abundances stable through time in Athens and Greene samples but dynamic in Licking groundwater. Shotgun metagenomic analyses generated 71 putative CPR genomes, representing roughly 32 known phyla and 2 putative new phyla, Candidatus Brownbacteria and Candidatus Hugbacteria. While these genomes largely mirrored metabolic characteristics of known CPR members, some features were previously uncharacterized. For instance, nitrite reductase, encoded by nirK, was found in four of our Parcubacteria genomes and multiple CPR genomes from other studies, indicating a potentially undescribed role for these microorganisms in denitrification. Additionally, glycoside hydrolase (GH) family profiles for our 71 genomes and over 2000 other CPR genomes were analyzed to characterize their carbon-processing potential. Although common trends were present throughout the radiation, differences highlighted potential mechanisms that could allow microorganisms across the CPR to occupy various subsurface niches. For example, members of the Microgenomates superphylum appear to potentially degrade a wider range of carbon substrates than other CPR phyla. Conclusions: CPR members are present across a range of environments and often constitute a significant fraction of the microbial population in groundwater systems, particularly. Further sampling of such environments will resolve this portion of the tree of life at finer taxonomic levels, which is essential to solidify functional differences between members that populate this phylogenetically broad region of the tree of life.","2017","5","10.1186/s40168-017-0331-1","me","not yet"

Here, we describe applications of computer-assisted microscopy using CMEIAS (Center for Microbial Ecology Image Analysis System) bioimage informatics software for a comprehensive analysis of river biofilm architectures and ecology. Natural biofilms were developed for four summer days on microscope slides of plain borosilicate glass and transparent polystyrene submerged in the Red Cedar River that flows through the Michigan State University campus. Images of the biofilm communities were acquired using brightfield and phase-contrast microscopy at spatial resolutions revealing details of microcolonies and individual cells, then digitally segmented to the foreground objects of interest. Phenotypic features of their size, abundance, surface texture, contour morphology, fractal geometry, ecophysiology, and landscape/spatial ecology were digitally extracted and evaluated by many discriminating statistical tests. The results indicate that river biofilm architecture exhibits significant geospatial structure in situ, providing many insights on the strong influence that substratum hydrophobicity-wettability exert on biofilm development and ecology, including their productivity and colonization intensity, morphological diversity/dominance/conditional rarity, nutrient apportionment/uptake efficiency/utilization, allometry/metabolic activity, responses to starvation and bacteriovory stresses, spatial patterns of distribution/dispersion/connectivity, and interpolated autocorrelations of cooperative/conflicting cell-cell interactions at real-world spatial scales directly relevant to their ecological niches. The significant impact of substratum physicochemistry was revealed for biofilms during their early immature stage of development in the river ecosystem.

Computed nutrient-light-salt limited algal growth supports grazing, mortality and carbon flow. Vertical transport is diffusive but responds to pore structure. Simulated bottom layer chlorophyll maxima are reasonable, though delayed by about a month relative to observations due to uncertainties in snow variability. Upper level biota arise intermittently during flooding events. Macromolecular concentrations are tracked as proxy proteins, polysaccharides, lipids and refractory humics. The fresh biopolymers undergo succession and removal by bacteria. Baseline organics enter solely through cell disruption, thus the internal carbon content is initially biased low.

Few studies have investigated patterns of hypolithic community composition at intermediate distances. We examined hypolithic cyanobacterial diversity in semi-arid Australia along a 10-km transect by sampling six rocks from four adjacent 1m(2) quadrats (distance zero) and from additional quadrats at 10, 100, 1,000, and 10,000m to test the hypothesis that diversity would increase with the number of rocks sampled and distance. A total of 3,108 cyanobacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were detected. Most were neither widespread nor abundant. The few that were widespread tended to be abundant. There was no difference in the community composition between the four sites at distance zero, but the samples 10m away were significantly different, as were those at all other distances compared to distance zero. Many additional OTUs were recorded with increasing distance up to 100m. These patterns of distribution are consistent with a colonization model involving dispersal from rock to rock. Our results indicate that distance was a significant factor that can be confounded by interrock differences. Most diversity was represented in the first 100m of the transect, with an additional 1.5% of the total diversity added by the sample at 1km, but only 0.2% added with the addition of the 10-km site.","2017","7","10.1002/ece3.3248","me","not yet"

In plants, fungal symbionts can ameliorate the abiotic stressors that accompany climate warming and thus could influence plants under a changing climate. Forecasting future plant-microbe interactions first requires knowledge of current fungal symbiont distributions, which are poorly resolved relative to the distributions of plants. Location: We used meta-analysis to summarize the biogeographic distributions of plant-fungal symbionts in mountain ecosystems worldwide, because these ecosystems are likely to be among the first to experience climate change-induced range shifts. Methods: We analysed 374 records from 53 publications to identify general trends, pinpoint areas in need of greater study and develop reporting guidelines to facilitate future syntheses. Results: Elevational patterns varied strongly among fungal and plant functional groups. Fungal diversity and abundance increased with altitude for the ectomycorrhizal fungi. However, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and localized foliar endophytes declined in either abundance or diversity with altitude. In shrubs, fungal abundance increased with elevation, but in C-3 grasses, fungal abundance declined with elevation. Altitudinal patterns in fungal composition were stronger than gradients in fungal abundance or diversity, suggesting that species turnover contributes more to elevational gradients in fungal symbionts than does variation in abundance or richness. Plant functional groups were overrepresented by C-3 grasses and trees, with surprisingly few data on sedges or shrubs, despite their ecological dominance in mountain ecosystems. Similarly, epichloae, ericoid mycorrhizal fungi and root endophytes were understudied relative to other fungal groups.

However, the relative strengths of these processes need to be further elucidated. Here, with a large scale sampling along an elevational gradient of 2000 m in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, we examined the interplay among the three processes, as well as their relative importance to the biogeography of bacterial communities. Variation partitioning showed that environmental selection, competition and spatial variables jointly explained 37% of the total variation among the bacterial communities. The non-spatially structured environmental variables explained more variation than spatial distance or competition. Two environmental factors, elevation and soil pH, were shown to be the main cues determining soil bacterial communities. Environmental variables and spatial distance also exerted indirect effects on community variation via competition. The main conclusion of this study is consistent with the idea that the environment selects. Competition and spatial processes were less important in shaping bacterial communities of Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.","2017","117","10.1016/j.apsoil.2017.05.012","me","not yet"

However, little is known about the determinants of their diversity and biogeographic patterns. Here, we compared fungal communities in rhizosphere and bulk soils of wheat fields in the North China Plain. The rhizosphere had a lower fungal diversity (observed OTUs and Chao1) than bulk soil, and a distinct fungal community structure in rhizosphere compared with bulk soil. The relative importance of environmental factors and geographic distance for fungal distribution differed between rhizosphere and bulk soil. Environmental factors were the primary cause of variations in total fungal community and major fungal phyla in bulk soil. By contrast, fungal communities in soils loosely attached to roots were predictable from both environmental factors and influences of geographic distance. Communities in soils tightly attached to roots were mainly determined by geographic distance. Our results suggest that both contemporary environment processes (present-day abiotic and biotic environment characters) and historical processes (spatial isolation, dispersal limitation occurred in the past) dominate variations of fungal communities in wheat fields, but their relative importance of all these processes depends on the proximity of fungal community to the plant roots.","2017","19","10.1111/1462-2920.13865","me","not yet"

Differences in litter quality and in soil microbial community composition can influence the litter decomposition and home-field advantage (HFA). However, our knowledge about the relative role of litter and soil characteristics on litter decomposition and HFA effects is still limited, especially under long-term N deposition. 2. We collected soil and two types of litter (monospecific and mixed species litter) from five replicate plots from a long-term N deposition field experiment with seven N addition treatments (0, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 50 g N m(-2) year(-1)). We examined the effects of N addition on litter quality and soil characteristics. We then carried out a three-pronged microcosm decomposition experiment with (i) litter from different N addition treatments decomposed on a standard field soil; (ii) standard litter decomposed on soils from the different N addition treatments; and (iii) litter decomposed on soil from the same N addition treatment plot. 3. Decomposition of litter on standard soil was influenced strongly by the N addition treatment, but did not consistently decrease or increase with increasing N addition rates. Instead, decomposition of standard litter on soils collected from different N addition treatments decreased with increasing rates of N addition. Decomposition of litter on soil collected from the same plot increased with increasing N addition rates. Soil characteristics explained more of the variation in litter decomposition than litter characteristics. 4. There was a clear HFA effect for litter decomposition, both from a litter and from a soil perspective. HFA effects increased when the dissimilarity in litter quality (N content and C : N ratio) increase among the different N addition treatments and the soil effect was strongest at high N addition rates. 5. N addition influenced litter decomposition by changing both litter and soil characteristics. Importantly, N addition decreased the capability of soils to decompose litter and it increased the HFA effect indicating that soils decomposed local litter better than other litter, due to specialization in soil communities. Nitrogen deposition is an important threat to ecosystems worldwide and our study emphasizes that ecosystem functions such as decomposition can be greatly influenced by these global changes.","2017","31","10.1111/1365-2435.12863","me","not yet"

Here, we compare NFR and diazotrophic diversity (assessed via high-throughput nifH sequencing) from a region known to be dominated by cyanobacterial diazotrophs (the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre, NPSG) to two regions dominated by heterotrophic diazotrophs: the Eastern South Pacific (ESP, from the Chilean upwelling system to the subtropical gyre) and the Pacific Northwest coastal upwelling system (PNW). We observed distinct biogeographical patterns among the three regions. Diazotrophic community structure differed strongly between the NPSG, dominated by cyanobacterium UCYN-A, and the ESP, dominated by heterotrophic nifH group 1J/1K, yet surface NFR were similar in magnitude (up to 5.1 nmol N L-1 d(-1)). However, while diverse, predominantly heterotrophic nifH genes were recovered from the PNW and the mesopelagic of the NPSG, NFR were undetectable in both of these environments (although glucose amendments stimulated low rates in the deep NPSG). Our work suggests that while diazotrophs may be nearly omnipresent in marine waters, the activity of this functional group is regionally restricted. Further, we show that the detection limits of the N-15(2) fixation assay suggest that many of the low NFR reported for the mesopelagic (often< 0.1 nmol N L-1 d(-1) in the literature) are not indicative of active diazotrophy, highlighting the challenges of assessing the ecosystem significance of heterotrophic diazotrophs.","2017","62","10.1002/lno.10542","me","not yet"

In some species, there is a strong correlation between geographical distance and genetic distance, which can be caused by different evolutionary mechanisms. Patterns of ancient admixture in Helicobacter pylori can be reconstructed in concordance with past human migration, whereas in Mycobacterium tuberculosis it is the lack of recombination that causes allopatric clusters. In Campylobacter, analyses of genomic data and molecular typing have been successful in determining the reservoir host species, but not geographical origin. We investigated biogeographical variation in highly recombining genes to determine the extent of clustering between genomes from geographically distinct Campylobacter populations. Whole-genome sequences from 294 Campylobacter isolates from North America and the UK were analysed. Isolates from within the same country shared more recently recombined DNA than isolates from different countries. Using 15 UK/American closely matched pairs of isolates that shared ancestors, we identify regions that have frequently and recently recombined to test their correlation with geographical origin. The seven genes that demonstrated the greatest clustering by geography were used in an attribution model to infer geographical origin which was tested using a further 383 UK clinical isolates to detect signatures of recent foreign travel. Patient records indicated that in 46 cases, travel abroad had occurred less than two weeks prior to sampling, and genomic analysis identified that 34 (74%) of these isolates were of a non-UK origin.

A recent sampling revealed that only a few fungal groups, as defined by internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) sequence similarity, dominate culturable root endophytic communities of nonmycorrhizal Microthlaspi spp. plants across Europe. Strains of these fungi display a broad phenotypic and functional diversity, which suggests a genetic variability masked by ITS clustering into operational taxonomic units (OTUs). The aims of this study were to identify how genetic similarity patterns of these fungi change across environments and to evaluate their ability to disperse and adapt to ecological conditions. A first ITS-based haplotype analysis of ten widespread OTUs mostly showed a low to moderate genotypic differentiation, with the exception of a group identified as Cadophora sp. that was highly diverse. A multilocus phylogeny based on additional genetic loci (partial translation elongation factor 1 alpha, beta-tubulin and actin) and amplified fragment length polymorphism profiling of 185 strains representative of the five dominant OTUs revealed a weak association of genetic differences with geography and environmental conditions, including bioclimatic and soil factors. Our findings suggest that dominant culturable root endophytic fungi have efficient dispersal capabilities, and that their distribution is little affected by environmental filtering. Other processes, such as inter-and intraspecific biotic interactions, may be more important for the local assembly of their communities.","2017","26","10.1111/mec.14231","me","not yet"

The spatial organization of this system is thought to be important in human health, yet this aspect of our resident microbiome is still poorly understood. In this study, we report significant spatial structure of the GI microbiota, and we identify general categories of spatial patterning in the distribution of microbial taxa along a healthy human GI tract. We further estimate the biotic interaction structure in the GI microbiota, both through time series and cooccurrence modeling of microbial community data derived from a large number of sequentially collected fecal samples. Comparison of these two approaches showed that species pairs involved in significant negative interactions had strong positive contemporaneous correlations and vice versa, while for species pairs without significant interactions, contemporaneous correlations were distributed around zero. We observed similar patterns when comparing these models to the spatial correlations between taxa identified in the adherent microbiota. This suggests that colocalization of microbial taxon pairs, and thus the spatial organization of the GI microbiota, is driven, at least in part, by direct or indirect biotic interactions. Thus, our study can provide a basis for an ecological interpretation of the biogeography of the human gut. IMPORTANCE The human gut microbiome is the subject of intense study due to its importance in health and disease. The majority of these studies have been based on the analysis of feces. However, little is known about how the microbial composition in fecal samples relates to the spatial distribution of microbial taxa along the gastrointestinal tract. By characterizing the microbial content both in intestinal tissue samples and in fecal samples obtained daily, we provide a conceptual framework for how the spatial structure relates to biotic interactions on the community level. We further describe general categories of spatial distribution patterns and identify taxa conforming to these categories. To our knowledge, this is the first study combining spatial and temporal analyses of the human gut microbiome. This type of analysis can be used for identifying candidate probiotics and designing strategies for clinical intervention.","2017","2","10.1128/mSystems.00086-17","me","not yet"

To estimate the evolutionary history of bean-nodulating Rhizobium etli-like bacteria in China, the genetic diversity and population structures of 77 strains belonging to seven genomic species isolated from eight sites in the temperate and subtropical regions were investigated in this study. As results, seven clades were defined in the phylogenetic network based upon the sequences of eight housekeeping and adaptation genes, in which some strains of different genospecies were intermingled due to the effects of adaptation genes on the phylogeny of chromosome. The close phylogenetic relationships of the tested strains with a Columbian strain R. etli CIAT 652, and their deeply separating from the Mexican reference strains demonstrated the evolution of Chinese bean-nodulating bacteria directly from the ancestors of South America. Distinct populations with varied haplotype diversity and nucleotide diversity were observed in the alkaline, strong acid and neutral-acid soils, and they may be affected by natural selection in the alkaline strong acid soils, or by the neutral selection in other sampling sites. The isolates in the neutral and acid soils were admixture containing more of the ancestral lineages similar to the American strains, while the isolates in strong acid (Chutan) and alkaline (Daqing) soils formed independent clusters. Soil factors shaped the rhizobial populations stronger than the geographic distance. Moreover, recombination contributed more in the evolution of R. etli-related populations than mutation.

Here we describe the core seed bank of a bacterial metacommunity from a boreal watershed, using the spatial distribution of bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) across 223 heterogeneous terrestrial, aquatic and phyllosphere bacterial assemblages. Taxa were considered potential seeds if they transitioned from rare to abundant somewhere within the metacommunity and if they were ubiquitous and able to persist under unfavorable conditions, the latter assessed by checking their presence in three deeply sequenced samples (one soil, one river and one lake, 2.2-3 million reads per sample). We show that only a small fraction (13%) of all detected OTUs constitute a metacommunity seed bank that is shared between all terrestrial and aquatic communities, but not by phyllosphere assemblages, which seem to recruit from a different taxa pool. Our results suggest directional recruitment driven by the flow of water in the landscape, since most aquatic sequences were associated to OTUs found in a single deeply-sequenced soil sample, but only 45% of terrestrial sequences belonged to OTUs found in the two deeply-sequenced aquatic communities. Finally, we hypothesize that extreme rarity, and its interplay with water residence time and growth rates, may further constrain the size of the potential seed bank.","2017","11","10.1038/ismej.2017.67","me","not yet"

The co-occurring native dune grass Leymus arenarius was also sampled in the United Kingdom, and the native dune grass Spinifex sericeus was sampled in Australia and New Zealand. A. arenaria associates with root fungal communities in its invasive range that are richer than those in the United Kingdom, and richer than those in co-occurring native grasses, demonstrating that exotic plants are not necessarily depauperate in fungal associates. Most of the dominant OTUs associating with A. arenaria were shared among all three geographic regions. However, community composition varied among regions, with differences in temperature, nitrogen and pH correlating with community change. Within regions, community composition varied among dunes, although the majority of sequences obtained were in OTUs that were detected in multiple dunes. Host plant species identity influenced fungal community composition, although the majority of the data were in OTUs that were shared between hosts. While the roots sampled appeared healthy, many of the dominant fungi recovered are potentially pathogenic. This study demonstrates that many fungi are widely dispersed, and that introduced plants are likely to associate with functionally diverse fungal communities that include species from their native ranges. However root-associated fungal community composition is variable, even at regional and local scales in a common plant in a common environment. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The vent effluent was classified as iron- or sulfur-rich corresponding with two distinct community types, dominated by either Zetaproteobacteria or Epsilonproteobacteria, respectively. The Zetaproteobacterial-based communities had the highest richness and diversity, which supports the hypothesis that Zetaproteobacteria function as ecosystem engineers creating a physical habitat within a chemical environment promoting enhanced microbial diversity. Gammaproteobacteria were also high in abundance within the iron-dominated mats and some likely contribute to primary production. In addition, we also compare sampling scale, showing that bulk sampling of microbial mats yields higher diversity than micro-scale sampling. We present a comprehensive analysis and offer new insights into the community structure and diversity of lithotrophically-driven microbial mats from a hydrothermal region associated with high microbial biodiversity.

These mixotrophs, lacking a constitutive capacity for photosynthesis (i.e. non-constitutive mixotrophs, NCMs), acquire their phototrophic potential through either integration of prey-plastids or through endosymbiotic associations with photosynthetic microbes. Analysis of field data reveals that 40-60% of plankton traditionally labelled as (non-phototrophic) microzooplankton are actually NCMs, employing acquired phototrophy in addition to phagotrophy. Specialist NCMs acquire chloroplasts or endosymbionts from specific prey, while generalist NCMs obtain chloroplasts from a variety of prey. These contrasting functional types of NCMs exhibit distinct seasonal and spatial global distribution patterns. Mixotrophs reliant on stolen chloroplasts, controlled by prey diversity and abundance, dominate in high-biomass areas. Mixotrophs harbouring intact symbionts are present in all waters and dominate particularly in oligotrophic open ocean systems. The contrasting temporal and spatial patterns of distribution of different mixotroph functional types across the oceanic provinces, as revealed in this study, challenges traditional interpretations of marine food web structures.

Here, by using the network-based analyses with three paralleled data sets derived from 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing, functional microarray, and predicted metagenome, we test our hypothesis that the network interactions of traits are more conserved than those of taxonomic measures, with significantly lower variation of network characteristics along the environmental gradient in acid mine drainage. The results showed that although the overall network characteristics remained similar, the structural variation was significantly lower at trait levels. The higher conserved individual node topological properties at trait level rather than at species level indicated that the responses of diverse traits remained relatively consistent even though different species played key roles under different environmental conditions. Additionally, the randomization tests revealed that it could not reject the null hypothesis that species- based correlations were random, while the tests suggested that correlation patterns of traits were non-random. Furthermore, relationships between trait-based network characteristics and environmental properties implied that trait-based networks might be more useful in reflecting the variation of ecosystem function. Taken together, our results suggest that deterministic trait-based community assembly results in greater conservation of network interaction, which may ensure ecosystem function across environmental regimes, emphasizing the potential importance of measuring the complexity and conservation of network interaction in evaluating the ecosystem stability and functioning.","2017","8","10.3389/fmicb.2017.01486","me","not yet"

Our results show that microbial communities differ across the supraglacial transect, but surprisingly these communities are strongly spatially autocorrelated, suggesting the presence of a supraglacial chronosequence. This pattern is dominated by phototrophic microbes (both bacteria and eukaryotes) which are less abundant near the terminus and more abundant higher on the glacier.

Our results indicated that the core taxa accounted for 87.4% of all the communities, predominantly including Betaproteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Thaumarchaeota. Whereas 10 of 22 metabolic phenotypes annotated using METAGENassist had significantly higher relative abundances in the core than satellite communities. Temporal variations in the composition of ammonia-oxidizing prokaryotes could be attributed to the seasonal nutrient concentrations. Multivariate statistical analysis indicated that environmental filtering rather than dispersal limitation is the primary mechanism driving the assembly of the whole, core and satellite communities at both taxonomic and functional levels. Network analysis revealed that the mutualistic interactions might also have certain roles in the assembly of the core taxonomic community.

However, current understanding of key microbial taxa and functional activities in both natural and restored ecosystems is limited. Here, we investigated the impact of nearly 30 years of carefully managed restoration on soil microbial communities at the Nachusa Grasslands in northern Illinois, USA. We characterized bacterial and archaeal communities in a chronosequence of restored tallgrass prairies ranging from 1 to 27 years old across a growing season and compared them to communities in pre-restoration agricultural fields and remnant prairies. Results indicate that older restorations harboured communities statistically distinct from newer restorations. These communities converged toward those in local prairie remnants, suggesting that plant-focussed restoration has yielded soil bacterial communities reflective of a successful restoration. Recovery of microbial clades within the Verrucomicrobia and Acidobacteria are an important feature of this convergence, and these groups could be targeted for future soil-focussed, bottom-up restoration studies.","2017","19","10.1111/1462-2920.13785","me","not yet"

Even though salt was previously identified as a major transition boundary for micro- and macroorganisms alike, the salinities causing species turnover in protistan communities are unknown. We investigated 4.5 million high-quality protistan metabarcodes (V4 region of the SSU rDNA) obtained from 24 shallow salt ponds (salinities 4%-44%) from South America and Europe. Statistical analyses of protistan community profiles identified four salinity classes, which strongly selected for different protistan communities: 4-9%, 14-24%, 27-36% and 38-44%. The proportion of organisms unknown to science is highest in the 14-24% salinity class, showing that environments within this salinity range are an unappreciated reservoir of as yet undiscovered organisms. Distinct higher-rank taxon groups dominated in the four salinity classes in terms of diversity. As increasing salinities require different cellular responses to cope with salt, our results suggest that different evolutionary lineages of protists have evolved distinct haloadaptation strategies. Salinity appears to be a stronger selection factor for the structuring of protistan communities than geography. Yet, we find a higher degree of endemism in shallow salt ponds compared with less isolated ecosystems such as the open ocean. Thus, rules for biogeographic structuring of protistan communities are not universal, but depend on the ecosystem under consideration.","2017","19","10.1111/1462-2920.13805","me","not yet"

To understand the specific effect of temperature on endophytic communities, a separate experiment was set up where grapevine cuttings were grown under controlled conditions at three different temperatures. The findings revealed the succession of endophytic communities over the year. Endophytic communities of roots and stems differ in terms of composition and dynamic response to temperature. Noticeably, compositional differences during the seasons affected bacterial taxa more in stems than in roots, suggesting that roots offer a more stable and less easily perturbed environment. Correlation abundance networks showed that the presence of several taxa (including Bradyrhizobium, Burkholderia, Dyella, Mesorhizobium, Propionibacterium and Ralstonia) is linked in both the field and the greenhouse.","2017","19","10.1111/1462-2920.13843","me","not yet"
"Gill, AS; Lee, A; McGuire, KL","Phylogenetic and Functional Diversity of Total (DNA) and Expressed (RNA) Bacterial Communities in Urban Green Infrastructure Bioswale Soils","APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY","New York City (NYC) is pioneering green infrastructure with the use of bioswales and other engineered soil-based habitats to provide stormwater infiltration and other ecosystem functions. In addition to avoiding the environmental and financial costs of expanding traditional built infrastructure, green infrastructure is thought to generate cobenefits in the form of diverse ecological processes performed by its plant and microbial communities. Yet, although plant communities in these habitats are closely managed, we lack basic knowledge about how engineered ecosystems impact the distribution and functioning of soil bacteria. We sequenced amplicons of the 16S ribosomal subunit, as well as seven genes associated with functional pathways, generated from both total (DNA-based) and expressed (RNA) soil communities in the Bronx, NYC, NY, in order to test whether bioswale soils host characteristic bacterial communities with evidence for enriched microbial functioning, compared to nonengineered soils in park lawns and tree pits. Bioswales had distinct, phylogenetically diverse bacterial communities, including taxa associated with nutrient cycling and metabolism of hydrocarbons and other pollutants. Bioswale soils also had a significantly greater diversity of genes involved in several functional pathways, including carbon fixation (cbbL-R [cbbL gene, red-like subunit] and apsA), nitrogen cycling (noxZ and amoA), and contaminant degradation (bphA); conversely, no functional genes were significantly more abundant in nonengineered soils. These results provide preliminary evidence that urban land management can shape the diversity and activity of soil communities, with positive consequences for genetic resources underlying valuable ecological functions, including biogeochemical cycling and degradation of common urban pollutants. IMPORTANCE Management of urban soil biodiversity by favoring taxa associated with decontamination or other microbial metabolic processes is a powerful prospect, but it first requires an understanding of how engineered soil habitats shape patterns of microbial diversity. This research adds to our understanding of urban microbial biogeography by providing data on soil bacteria in bioswales, which had relatively diverse and compositionally distinct communities compared to park and tree pit soils. Bioswales also contained comparatively diverse pools of genes related to carbon sequestration, nitrogen cycling, and contaminant degradation, suggesting that engineered soils may serve as effective reservoirs of functional microbial biodiversity. We also examined both total (DNA-based) and expressed (RNA) communities, revealing that total bacterial communities (the exclusive targets in the vast majority of soil studies) were poor predictors of expressed community diversity, pointing to the value of quantifying RNA, especially when ecological functioning is considered.","2017","83","10.1128/AEM.00287-17","me","not yet"

Furthermore, despite the evident importance of cyanobacteria in polar areas, there are hardly any studies focusing on the phylogenetic relationship between the Arctic and Antarctic cyanobacteria. Here, we described cyanobacterial mats as well as epi- and endoliths collected from shallow streams and rocks, respectively, in the northwestern part of Svalbard. Thirteen populations were identified and characterized by employing morphological and molecular (16S rRNA gene sequences) techniques. Our results were compared to analogous information (available from the GenBank) and related to organisms from similar environments located in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. In general, the morphological and molecular characterizations complemented each other, and the identified Arctic populations belonged to the following orders: Oscillatoriales (6), Nostocales (6), and Chroococcales (1). Twelve of the identified polar populations showed high similarity (94-99% 16S rRNA gene sequence) when compared to other Arctic and Antarctic cyanobacteria. Mat builder Phormidium autumnale shared only 88% similarity with sequences deposited in the GenBank. Our results demonstrate remarkable similarities of microbial life of Svalbard to that in Antarctica and the High Himalayas. Our findings are a starting point for future comparative research of the benthic as well as endolithic populations of cyanobacteria from the Arctic and Antarctica that will yield new insights into the cold and dry limits of life on Earth. They imply global distributions of the low-temperature cyanobacterial populations throughout the cold terrestrial biosphere.","2017","40","10.1007/s00300-017-2083-6","me","not yet"

A total of 7560 specimens from 155 limestone samples (within the interval of Lenodus variabilis - Pygodus anserinus biozones) are assigned to 22 species, representing a low taxonomic diversity and low abundance fauna. The fauna is dominated by the Acrotretoidea, mainly species of the Torynelasmatidae, with Torynelasma the most abundant (more than 40% of total number of specimens), along with the Eoconulidae and Eoconulus (18% of total) representing the second most common forms. Species of the Ephippelasmatidae are also common (16% of total) diverse, and include representatives of Myotreta and Numericoma, as well as Ephippelasma, whereas species of the Scaphelasmatidae are somewhat less common (13% of total). All three investigated sections represent outer shelf environments, but the Maocaopu section is situated in a relatively deeper position, in proximity of the south-eastern outer margin of the Upper Yangtze Platform, close to its boundary with the Jiangnan Slope. A quantitative analysis of the relative abundance data was carried out in order to investigate the biofacies distribution of the micromorphic brachiopod communities across the Yangtze Platform, something that has not been attempted before with Palaeozoic linguliforms. Six lingulate microbrachiopod communities could be recognized in the sections. The major biofacies shift, which occurred in the Cili section in the upper part of the Microzarkodina ozarkodella Zone, at the time of the onset and initial rise of the Mid Darriwilian Carbon Isotope Excursion (MDICE) suggests that these biofacies may have been depth controlled.","2017","3","10.1002/spp2.1077","me","not yet"

In a similar way to ecological systems of higher organisms, the holobiont shows interdependent and complex dynamics [1,2]. While plants originate from seeds, the microbiome has a multitude of sources. The assemblage of these communities depends on the interaction between the emerging seedling and its surrounding environment, with soil being the main source. These microbial communities are controlled by the plant through different strategies, such as the specific profile of root exudates and its immune system. Despite this control, the microbiome is still able to adapt and thrive. The molecular knowledge behind these interactions and microbial -omic technologies are developing to the point of enabling holobiont engineering. For a long time microorganisms were in the background of plant biology but new multidisciplinary approaches have led to an appreciation of the importance of the holobiont, where plants and microbes are interdependent.","2017","38","10.1016/j.mib.2017.07.001","me","not yet"

Using a DNA sequencing approach, we explored the biogeography of biofilm bacterial communities in 204 streams across a approximate to 1000 km latitudinal gradient. The range sizes of bacterial taxa were strongly correlated with latitude, decreasing closer to the equator, which coincided with a greater than fivefold increase in bacterial taxonomic richness. The relative richness and range size of bacteria were associated with spatially correlated variation in temperature and rainfall. These patterns were observed despite enormous variability in catchment environmental characteristics. Similar results were obtained when restricting the same analyses to native forest catchments, thereby controlling for spatial biases in land use. We analysed genomic data from approximate to 500 taxa detected in this study, for which data were available and found that bacterial communities at cooler latitudes also tended to possess greater potential metabolic potential. Collectively, these data provide the first evidence of latitudinal variation in the range size distributions of freshwater bacteria, a trend which may be determined, in part, by a trade-off between bacterial genome size and local variation in climatic conditions.","2017","19","10.1111/1462-2920.13797","me","not yet"

The aim of this study was to examine the elevational trends in species richness and local contribution to beta diversity (LCBD) of three biofilm microbial groups in freshwater ponds and to identify the key mechanisms underlying these patterns. Location: One hundred and forty-six ponds in subarctic Finland and Norway distributed across the tree line along an elevational gradient of 10-1,038 m a.s.l., spanning from forested landscape to barren boulder fields. Time period: July-August 2015. Major taxa studied: Diatoms, cyanobacteria and non-cyanobacteria. Methods: Generalized linear models were used to identify the most important pond variables explaining richness and LCBD. Structural equation models were used to explore the direct and indirect effects of multiscale drivers on richness and LCBD. Results: Diatom and cyanobacteria richness showed unimodal elevational patterns, whereas non-cyanobacteria richness decreased with increasing elevation. The LCBD-elevation relationship was U-shaped for all three microbial groups. Diatom and cyanobacteria richness and LCBD were best explained by local pond variables, especially by pH. Non-cyanobacteria richness and LCBD were related to pond variables, elevation as a proxy for climatic conditions, and normalized difference vegetation index as a proxy for terrestrial productivity. Main conclusions: Aquatic autotrophs were primarily controlled by environmental filtering, whereas heterotrophic bacteria were also affected by terrestrial productivity and elevation. All studied aspects of microbial diversity were directly or indirectly linked to elevation; therefore, climatic changes may greatly alter aquatic microbial assemblages.","2017","26","10.1111/geb.12607","me","not yet"
"Golan, JJ; Pringle, A","Long-Distance Dispersal of Fungi","MICROBIOLOGY SPECTRUM","Dispersal is a fundamental biological process, operating at multiple temporal and spatial scales. Despite an increasing understanding of fungal biodiversity, most research on fungal dispersal focuses on only a small fraction of species. Thus, any discussion of the dispersal dynamics of fungi as a whole is problematic. While abundant morphological and biogeographic data are available for hundreds of species, researchers have yet to integrate this information into a unifying paradigm of fungal dispersal, especially in the context of long-distance dispersal (LDD). Fungal LDD is mediated by multiple vectors, including meteorological phenomena (e.g., wind and precipitation), plants (e.g., seeds and senesced leaves), animals (e.g., fur, feathers, and gut microbiomes), and in many cases humans. In addition, fungal LDD is shaped by both physical constraints on travel and the ability of spores to survive harsh environments. Finally, fungal LDD is commonly measured in different ways, including by direct capture of spores, genetic comparisons of disconnected populations, and statistical modeling and simulations of dispersal data. To unify perspectives on fungal LDD, we propose a synthetic three-part definition that includes (i) an identification of the source population and a measure of the concentration of source inoculum and (ii) a measured and/or modeled dispersal kernel. With this information, LDD is defined as (iii) the distance found within the dispersal kernel beyond which only 1% of spores travel.","2017","5","10.1128/microbiolspec.FUNK-0047-2016","me","not yet"

Aromatic-ring-hydroxylating dioxygenases (ARHD) are proteins involved in AH degradation pathways. We used ARHD functional genes from an oil-impacted mangrove area and compared their diversity with other sites around the world to understand the ARHD biogeographic distribution patterns. For this, a comprehensive database was established with 166 operational protein families (OPFs) from 1,758 gene sequences obtained from 15 different sites worldwide, of which twelve are already published studies and three are unpublished. Based on a deduced ARHD peptide sequences consensus phylogeny, we examined trends and divergences in the sequence phylogenetic clustering from the different sites. The taxonomic affiliation of the OPF revealed that Pseudomonas, Streptomyces, Variovorax, Bordetella and Rhodococcus were the five most abundant genera, considering all sites. The functional diversity analysis showed the enzymatic prevalence of benzene 1,2-dioxygenase, 3-phenylpropionate dioxygenase and naphthalene 1,2-dioxygenase, in addition to 10.98% of undefined category ARHDs. The ARHD gene correlation analysis among different sites was essentially important to gain insights on spatial distribution patterns, genetic congruence and ecological coherence of the bacterial groups found. This work revealed the genetic potential from the mangrove sediment for AH biodegradation and a considerable evolutionary proximity among the dioxygenase OPFs found in Antarctica and South America sites, in addition to high level of endemism in each continental region.","2017","6","10.1002/mbo3.490","me","not yet"

Total DNA from three sediment depths was isolated and sequenced. The characterization of the total community was performed based on 16S rRNA gene inventory using SILVA database as reference. The diversity of diagnostic functional genes coding for nitrate reductases (napA; narG), nitrite: nitrate oxidoreductase (nxrA), nitrite reductases (nirK; nirS; nrfA), nitric oxide reductase (nor), nitrous oxide reductase (nosZ), hydrazine synthase (hzsA), ammonia monooxygenase (amoA), hydroxylamine oxidoreductase (hao), and nitrogenase (nifH) was analyzed by blastx against curated reference databases. In addition, Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based amplification was performed on the hzsA gene of anammox bacteria. Our results reveal high genomic potential for full denitrification to N-2, but minor importance of anaerobic ammonium oxidation and dissimilatory nitrite reduction to ammonium. Genomic potential for aerobic ammonia oxidation was dominated by Thaumarchaeota. A higher diversity of anammox bacteria was detected in metagenomes than with PCR-based technique.

"Carvallo, GO; Castro, SA","Invasions but not extinctions change phylogenetic diversity of angiosperm assemblage on southeastern Pacific Oceanic islands","PLOS ONE","We assessed changes in phylogenetic diversity of angiosperm flora on six oceanic islands located in the southeastern Pacific Ocean, by comparing flora from two periods: the pre-European colonization of islands and current times. We hypothesize that, in the time between these periods, extinction of local plant species and addition of exotic plants modified phylogenetic-alpha-diversity at different levels (deeper and terminal phylogeny) and increased phylo-beta-diversity among islands. Based on floristic studies, we assembled a phylogenetic tree from occurrence data that includes 921 species, of which 165 and 756 were native or exotic in origin, respectively. Then, we studied change in the phylo-alpha-diversity and phylo-beta-diversity (1-Phylosor) by comparing pre-European and current times. Despite extinction of 18 native angiosperm species, an increase in species richness and phylo-adiversity was observed for all islands studied, attributed to introduction of exotic plants (between 6 to 477 species per island). We did not observe significant variation of mean phylogenetic distance (MPD), a measure of the deeper phylogenetic diversity of assemblages (e.g., orders, families), suggesting that neither extinctions nor introductions altered phylogenetic structure of the angiosperms of these islands. In regard to phylo-beta-diversity, we detected temporal turnover (variation in phylogenetic composition) between periods to flora (0.38 +/- 0.11). However, when analyses were performed only considering native plants, we did not observe significant temporal turnover between periods (0.07 +/- 0.06). These results indicate that introduction of exotic angiosperms has contributed more notably than extinctions to the configuration of plant assemblages and phylogenetic diversity on the studied islands. Because phylogenetic diversity is closely related to functional diversity (species trait variations and roles performed by organisms), our results suggests that the introduction of exotic plants to these islands could have detrimental impacts for ecosystem functions and ecosystem services that islands provide (e.g. productivity).","2017","12","10.1371/journal.pone.0182105","me","not yet"

Although we assume this decline will greatly affect ecosystem functioning, particularly in alpine and arctic areas where cryptogams make a substantial amount of biomass, the effects of this change in vegetation on soil microbial communities remains unknown. We asked whether changes in bacterial community composition and enzyme ratios were consistent across two sites in moss versus vascular plant dominated areas. Using data from treeline and subnival ecosystems, we compared bacterial community composition, enzyme activity, and soil chemistry in moss dominated and vascular plant dominated plots of two unique alpine environments. Further, we used a time series to examine plots that actively transitioned from moss dominated to vascular plant dominated over a seven-year time period. Bacterial community composition in the soils under these two vegetation covers was significantly different in both environments and changed over time due to plant colonization. Microbial activity was limited by carbon and phosphorus in all plots and there were no differences in BG:AP enzyme ratios; however, there were significantly higher NAG:AP and BG:AP ratios in vascular plant plots at one site, suggesting the potential for shifts toward microbial N acquisition in vascular plant dominated areas in the alpine. As vascular plants replace mosses under warming conditions, bacterial community composition and nutrient availability shift in ways that may result in changes to biogeochemical cycling and biotic interactions in these vulnerable ecosystems.

In high-iron environments, such as diffuse hydrothermal vents, the Zetaproteobacteria are important members of the community driving its structure. Biogeography of Zetaproteobacteria has shown two ubiquitous operational taxonomic units (OTUs), yet much is unknown about their genomic diversity. Genome-resolved metagenomics allows for the specific binning of microbial genomes based on genomic signatures present in composite metagenome assemblies. This resulted in the recovery of 93 genome bins, of which 34 were classified as Zetaproteobacteria. Form II ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase genes were recovered from nearly all the Zetaproteobacteria genome bins. In addition, the Zetaproteobacteria genome bins contain genes for uptake and utilization of bioavailable nitrogen, detoxification of arsenic, and a terminal electron acceptor adapted for low oxygen concentration. Our results also support the hypothesis of a Cyc2-like protein as the site for iron oxidation, now detected across a majority of the Zetaproteobacteria genome bins. Whole genome comparisons showed a high genomic diversity across the Zetaproteobacteria OTUs and genome bins that were previously unidentified by SSU rRNA gene analysis. A single lineage of cosmopolitan Zetaproteobacteria (zOTU 2) was found to be monophyletic, based on cluster analysis of average nucleotide identity and average amino acid identity comparisons. From these data, we can begin to pinpoint genomic adaptations of the more ecologically ubiquitous Zetaproteobacteria, and further understand their environmental constraints and metabolic potential.","2017","11","10.1038/ismej.2017.40","me","not yet"
"Shirani, S; Hellweger, FL","Neutral Evolution and Dispersal Limitation Produce Biogeographic Patterns in Microcystis aeruginosa Populations of Lake Systems","MICROBIAL ECOLOGY","Molecular observations reveal substantial biogeographic patterns of cyanobacteria within systems of connected lakes. An important question is the relative role of environmental selection and neutral processes in the biogeography of these systems. Here, we quantify the effect of genetic drift and dispersal limitation by simulating individual cyanobacteria cells using an agent-based model (ABM). In the model, cells grow (divide), die, and migrate between lakes. Each cell has a full genome that is subject to neutral mutation (i.e., the growth rate is independent of the genome). The model is verified by simulating simplified lake systems, for which theoretical solutions are available. Then, it is used to simulate the biogeography of the cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa in a number of real systems, including the Great Lakes, Klamath River, Yahara River, and Chattahoochee River. Model output is analyzed using standard bioinformatics tools (BLAST, MAFFT). The emergent patterns of nucleotide divergence between lakes are dynamic, including gradual increases due to accumulation of mutations and abrupt changes due to population takeovers by migrant cells (coalescence events). The model predicted nucleotide divergence is heterogeneous within systems, and for weakly connected lakes, it can be substantial. For example, Lakes Superior and Michigan are predicted to have an average genomic nucleotide divergence of 8200 bp or 0.14%. The divergence between more strongly connected lakes is much lower. Our results provide a quantitative baseline for future biogeography studies. They show that dispersal limitation can be an important factor in microbe biogeography, which is contrary to the common belief, and could affect how a system responds to environmental change.","2017","74","10.1007/s00248-017-0963-5","me","not yet"
"Verstraete, B; Janssens, S; Ronsted, N","Non-nodulated bacterial leaf symbiosis promotes the evolutionary success of its host plants in the coffee family (Rubiaceae)","MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION","Every plant species on Earth interacts in some way or another with microorganisms and it is well known that certain forms of symbiosis between different organisms can drive evolution. Within some clades of Rubiaceae (coffee family), a specific plant-bacteria interaction exists in which non-pathological endophytes are present in the leaves of their hosts. It is hypothesized that the bacterial endophytes, either alone or by interacting with the host, provide chemical protection against herbivory or pathogens by producing toxic or otherwise advantageous secondary metabolites. If the bacteria indeed have a direct beneficial influence on their hosts, it is reasonable to assume that the endophytes may increase the fitness of their hosts and therefore it is probable that their presence also has an influence on the long-term evolution of the particular plant lineages. In this study, the possible origin in time of non-nodulated bacterial leaf symbiosis in the Vanguerieae tribe of Rubiaceae is elucidated and dissimilarities in evolutionary dynamics between species with endophytes versus species without are investigated. Bacterial leaf symbiosis is shown to have most probably originated in the Late Miocene, a period when the savannah habitat is believed to have expanded on the African continent and herbivore pressure increased. The presence of bacterial leaf endophytes appears to be restricted to Old World lineages so far. Plant lineages with leaf endophytes show a significantly higher speciation rate than plant lineages without endophytes, while there is only a small difference in extinction rate. The transition rate shows that evolving towards having endophytes is twice as fast as evolving towards not having endophytes, suggesting that leaf symbiosis must be beneficial for the host plants. We conclude that the presence of bacterial leaf endophytes may also be an important driver for speciation of host plants. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Their biosurfactants and degradation enzymes have been in the spotlight, mainly due to the awareness of ecosystem pollution caused by crude oil accidents and their use. Initially, the scientific community studied the role of individual microbial species by characterizing and optimizing their biosurfactant and oil degradation genes, studying their individual distribution. However, with the advances in genomics, in particular with the use of New-Generation-Sequencing and Metagenomics, it is now possible to have a macro view of the complex pathways related to the symbiotic degradation of hydrocarbons and surfactant production. It is now possible, although more challenging, to obtain the DNA information of an entire microbial community before automatically characterizing it. By characterizing and understanding the interconnected role of microorganisms and the role of degradation and biosurfactant genes in an ecosystem, it becomes possible to develop new biotechnological approaches for bioremediation use. This paper analyzes 46 different metagenome samples, spanning 20 biomes from different geographies obtained from different research projects. Results: A metagenomics bioinformatics pipeline, focused on the biodegradation and biosurfactant-production pathways, genes and organisms, was applied. Our main results show that: (1) surfactation and degradation are correlated events, and therefore should be studied together; (2) terrestrial biomes present more degradation genes, especially cyclic compounds, and less surfactation genes, when compared to water biomes; and (3) latitude has a significant influence on the diversity of genes involved in biodegradation and biosurfactant production. This suggests that microbiomes found near the equator are richer in genes that have a role in these processes and thus have a higher biotechnological potential. Conclusion: In this work we have focused on the biogeographical distribution of hydrocarbon degrading and biosurfactant producing genes. Our principle results can be seen as an important step forward in the application of bioremediation techniques, by considering the biostimulation, optimization or manipulation of a starting microbial consortia from the areas with higher degradation and biosurfactant producing genetic diversity.","2017","17","10.1186/s12866-017-1077-4","me","not yet"

Yet, the microbial communities associated with invasive plants are generally poorly understood. Here we report on the first comprehensive investigation of the bacterial and fungal communities inhabiting the rhizosphere and the surrounding bulk soil of a widespread invasive tree, Acacia dealbata. Amplicon sequencing data indicated that rhizospheric microbial communities differed significantly in structure and composition from those of the bulk soil. Two bacterial (Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria) and two fungal (Pezizomycetes and Agaricomycetes) classes were enriched in the rhizosphere compared with bulk soils. Changes in nutritional status, possibly induced by A. dealbata, primarily shaped rhizosphere soil communities. Despite a high degree of geographic variability in the diversity and composition of microbial communities, invasive A. dealbata populations shared a core of bacterial and fungal taxa, some of which are known to be involved in N and P cycling, while others are regarded as plant pathogens. Shotgun metagenomic analysis also showed that several functional genes related to plant growth promotion were overrepresented in the rhizospheres of A. dealbata. Overall, results suggest that rhizosphere microbes may contribute to the widespread success of this invader in novel environments.","2017","7","10.1038/s41598-017-07018-w","me","not yet"

However, little is known about the oxidative weathering of inactive sulfide chimneys, nor about associated microbial community structures and their succession during this weathering process. In this work, an inactive sulfide chimney and a young chimney in the early sulfate stage of formation were collected from the Main Endeavor Field of the Juan de Fuca Ridge. To assess oxidative weathering, the ultrastructures of secondary alteration products accumulating on the chimney surface were examined and the presence of possible Fe-oxidizing bacteria (FeOB) was investigated. The results of ultrastructure observation revealed that FeOB-associated ultrastructures with indicative morphologies were abundantly present. Iron oxidizers primarily consisted of members closely related to Gallionella spp. and Mariprofundus spp., indicating Fe-oxidizing species likely promote the oxidative weathering of inactive sulfide chimneys. Abiotic accumulation of Fe-rich substances further indicates that oxidative weathering is a complex, dynamic process, alternately controlled by FeOB and by abiotic oxidization. Although hydrothermal fluid flow had ceased, inactive chimneys still accommodate an abundant and diverse microbiome whose microbial composition and metabolic potential dramatically differ from their counterparts at active vents. Bacterial lineages within current inactive chimney are dominated by members of alpha-, delta-, and gamma-Proteobacteria and they are deduced to be closely involved in a diverse set of geochemical processes including iron oxidation, nitrogen fixation, ammonia oxidation and denitrification. At last, by examining microbial communities within hydrothermal chimneys at different formation stages, a general microbial community succession can be deduced from early formation stages of a sulfate chimney to actively mature sulfide structures, and then to the final inactive altered sulfide chimney. Our findings provide valuable insights into the microbe-involved oxidative weathering process and into microbial succession occurring at inactive hydrothermal sulfide chimney after high-temperature hydrothermal fluids have ceased venting.","2017","8","10.3389/fmicb.2017.01378","me","not yet"

Recent climatic history has strongly impacted plant populations, but little is known about its effect on microbes. Alders, which host few and specific symbionts, have high genetic diversity in glacial refugia. Here, we tested the prediction that communities of root symbionts survived in refugia with their host populations. We expected to detect endemic symbionts and a higher species richness in refugia as compared to recolonized areas. Methods. We sampled ectomycorrhizal (EM) root tips and the nitrogen -fixing actin mycete Frankia communities in eight sites colonized by Alnus glutinosa insubsp. barbata close to the Caucasus in Georgia. Three sites were located the Colchis, one major Eurasian climatic refugia for Arcto-Tertiary flora and alders, and five sites were located in the recolonized zone. Endemic symbionts and plant ITS variants were detected by comparing sequences to published data from Europe and another Tertiary reftigium, the Hyrcanian forest. Species richness and community structure were compared between sites from refugia and recolonized areas for each symbionts. Results. For both symbionts, most MOTUs present in Georgia had been found previously elsewhere in Europe, Three endemic Frankia strains were detected in the Colchis vs two in the recolonized zone, and the five endemic EM fungi were detected only in the recolonized zone. Frankia species richness was higher in the Colchis while the contrary was observed for EM fungi. Moreover, the genetic diversity of one alder specialist Alnicola xanthophylla was particularly high in the recolonized zone. The EM communities occurring in the Colchis and the IHyrcanian forests shared closely related endemic species. Discussion, The Colchis did not have the highest alpha diversity and more endemic species, suggesting that our hypothesis based on alder biogeography may not apply to alders symbionts. Our study in the Caucasus brings new clues to understand symbioses biogeography and their survival in Tertiary and ice -age refugia, and reveals that isolated host populations could be of interest for symbiont diversity conservation.","2017","5","10.7717/peerj.3479","me","not yet"
"Petersen, J; Wagner-Dobler, I","Plasmid Transfer in the Ocean - A Case Study from the Roseobacter Group","FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY","Plasmid mediated horizontal gene transfer (HGT) has been speculated to be one of the prime mechanisms for the adaptation of roseobacters (Rhodobacteraceae) to their ecological niches in the marine habitat. Their plasmids contain ecologically crucial functional modules of up to similar to 40-kb in size, e.g., for aerobic anoxygenic photosynthesis, flagellar formation and the biosynthesis of the antibiotic tropodithietic acid. Furthermore, the widely present type four secretion system (T4SS) of roseobacters has been shown to mediate conjugation across genus barriers, albeit in the laboratory. Here we discovered that Confluentimicrobium naphthalenivorans NS6(T), a tidal flat bacterium isolated in Korea, carries a 185-kb plasmid, which exhibits a long-range synteny with the conjugative 126-kb plasmid of Dinoroseobacter shibae DFL12(T). Both replicons are stably maintained by RepABC operons of the same compatibility group (-2) and they harbor a homologous T4SS. Principal component analysis of the codon usage shows a large similarity between the two plasmids, while the chromosomes are very distinct, showing that neither of the two bacterial species represents the original host of those RepABC-2 type plasmids. The two species do not share a common habitat today and they are phylogenetically only distantly related. Our finding demonstrates the first clear-cut evidence for conjugational plasmid transfer across biogeographical and phylogenetic barriers in Rhodobacteraceae and documents the importance of conjugative HGT in the ocean.","2017","8","10.3389/fmicb.2017.01350","me","not yet"

Whether and how environmental change will propagate into methanogenic assemblages of natural environments remains largely unknown owing to a poor understanding of global distribution patterns and environmental drivers of this specific group of microorganisms. In this study, we performed a meta-analysis targeting the biogeographic patterns and environmental controls of methanogenic communities using 94 public mcrA gene datasets. We show a global pattern of methanogenic archaea that is more associated with habitat filtering than with geographical dispersal. We identify salinity as the control on methanogenic community composition at global scale whereas pH and temperature are the major controls in non-saline soils and lakes. The importance of salinity for structuring methanogenic community composition is also reflected in the biogeography of methanogenic lineages and the physiological properties of methanogenic isolates. Linking methanogenic alpha-diversity with reported values of methane emission identifies estuaries as the most diverse methanogenic habitats with, however, minor contribution to the global methane budget. With salinity, temperature and pH our study identifies environmental drivers of methanogenic community composition facing drastic changes in many natural environments at the moment. However, consequences of this for the production of methane remain elusive owing to a lack of studies that combine methane production rate with community analysis.","2017","8","10.3389/fmicb.2017.01339","me","not yet"

High concentrations of nutrients from the Xiaoqing River are considered as the main cause for significant eutrophication in the west of Laizhou Bay. Here we present results of the research on sedimentary microbial assemblages along this spatial gradient between riverine and marine environments by high-throughput sequencing. The predominant phyla/classes of bacteria and fungi clustered the samples into two distinct provinces, while discriminant taxa of each province were strongly associated with spatial factors and inorganic nitrogen. Spatial variation of bacterial communities was mainly related with the distribution of phosphates, suggesting a phosphate-limitation pattern for the bacterial communities. Alpha- and beta-diversity of fungal communities exhibited a significant correlation with water depth. We consider the distinct distributional gradients of bacterial and fungal communities partly explain the different roles in the biogeochemical processes of coastal sediment.","2017","120","10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.04.059","me","not yet"
"Malik, AA; Thomson, BC; Whiteley, AS; Bailey, M; Griffiths, RI","Bacterial Physiological Adaptations to Contrasting Edaphic Conditions Identified Using Landscape Scale Metagenomics","MBIO","Environmental factors relating to soil pH are important regulators of bacterial taxonomic biodiversity, yet it remains unclear if such drivers affect community functional potential. To address this, we applied whole-genome metagenomics to eight geographically distributed soils at opposing ends of a landscape soil pH gradient (where low-pH is similar to pH 4.3 and high-pH is similar to pH 8.3) and evaluated functional differences with respect to functionally annotated genes. First, differences in taxonomic and functional diversity between the two pH categories were assessed with respect to alpha diversity (mean sample richness) and gamma diversity (total richness pooled for each pH category). Low-pH soils, also exhibiting higher organic matter and moisture, consistently had lower taxonomic alpha and gamma diversity, but this was not apparent in assessments of functional alpha and gamma diversity. However, coherent changes in the relative abundances of annotated genes between low-and high-pH soils were identified; with strong multivariate clustering of samples according to pH independent of geography. Assessment of indicator genes revealed that the acidic organic-rich soils possessed a greater abundance of cation efflux pumps, C and N direct fixation systems, and fermentation pathways, indicating adaptations to both acidity and anaerobiosis. Conversely, high-pH soils possessed more direct transporter-mediated mechanisms for organic C and N substrate acquisition. These findings highlight the distinctive physiological adaptations required for bacteria to survive in soils of various nutrient availability and edaphic conditions and more generally indicate that bacterial functional versatility with respect to functional gene annotations may not be constrained by taxonomy. IMPORTANCE Over a set of soil samples spanning Britain, the widely reported reductions in bacterial taxonomic richness at low pH were found not to be accompanied by significant reductions in the richness of functional genes. However, consistent changes in the abundance of related functional genes were observed, characteristic of differential ecological and nutrient acquisition strategies between high-pH mineral soils and low-pH organic anaerobic soils. Our assessment at opposing ends of a soil gradient encapsulates the limits of functional diversity in temperate climates and identifies key pathways that may serve as indicators for soil element cycling and C storage processes in other soil systems. To this end, we make available a data set identifying functional indicators of the different soils; as well as raw sequences, which given the geographic scale of our sampling should be of value in future studies assessing novel genetic diversity of a wide range of soil functional attributes.","2017","8","10.1128/mBio.00799-17","me","not yet"

Following the Polish meeting, ISTA came for the first time to the American continent as well as the Southern hemisphere: ISTA8 was held in the Brazilian town of Ilhabela during 12-14 September 2016, consisting of 3 days of presentations, discussions and a small trip to the native rain forest, one of the last remnants of the Mata Atlantica biome still existing on this tropical island, off the coast of Sao Paulo State. There were 39 participants, from 10 countries, from which 65% were students (from undergraduate to PhD) thus illustrating the recent development of the field of research. Also noteworthy was the expansion of the research fields, spanning from phylogenomics to biogeography and palaeontology. While the initial meetings in the 2000s focused still mainly on palaeoecology and bioindication, the modern ones tend to address a wider panel of topics and cover most of the important research interests in organismal biology. Indeed, the future of testate amoebae research seems to be bright, as the meeting was teeming with new ideas and research direction that will further expand the field. The meeting was organized by the Laboratory of Evolutionary Protistology headed by Daniel J. G. Lahr, University of Sao Paulo with the help of the Sociedade Brasileira de Protozoologia (SBPz).

Here, at the intra-species level, we characterized the structural variation in rhizobial populations in soybean rhizosphere under field conditions across 32 sampling sites in three eco-regions. LocationNorth-east (Heilongjiang), north (Hebei-Shandong) and south (Jiangxi) China. MethodsThe intra-species diversity of rhizobia in soybean rhizospheres was investigated by rpoB pyrosequencing. Soybean nodule isolates were characterized using repetitive extragenic palindromic PCR, restriction fragment length polymorphism of 16S-23S intergenic sequences and rpoB PCR sequencing. Patterns and processes of biogeography of identified rhizobia were studied. ResultsSignificant biogeographical patterns of rhizosphere rhizobia at the species level were found, and the abundant species in the rhizosphere were generally the dominant microsymbionts in soybean nodules. The distribution of rhizobial species in the rhizosphere across eco-regions correlated with combined effects of spatial, vegetative, edaphic and climatic variables. Gene flow and genetic differentiation analyses revealed that there was no dispersal limitation among geographical populations of the same rhizobial species, and drift or subsequent diversification might be involved in shaping the biogeographical pattern in addition to environmental factors. Main conclusionsThese results constitute the first report of the existence of rhizobial biogeography in legume rhizospheres at the species level, contrasting with most studies, which focused on nodule isolates. The method developed in this study could be used to uncover, at high resolution, the diversity of local rhizobial populations in soils. This information is crucial for choosing suitable strains or species as inoculants for a specific legume host under local field conditions. Moreover, a similar strategy could be used to study other bacteria with important ecological functions.","2017","44","10.1111/jbi.12891","me","not yet"

Although microbes have irreplaceable roles in various ecosystems, the spatial variation in microbial communities has received less attention in comparison to macro-organisms. Studies aiming to disentangle the effects of local environmental, catchment and climatic variables on microbial communities are also rare. Here, we disentangled the effects of local, catchment, spatial and climatic variables on boreal stream diatom and bacterial communities. LocationWestern Finland MethodsWe sampled 21 boreal river basins comprising 105 study sites spanning 520km in north-south direction and 330km in east-west direction in western Finland. We used principal coordinates of neighbour matrix analysis (PCNM), redundancy analyses (RDA), variation partitioning, boosted regression trees (BRT) and regression analyses to examine variation in community composition and species richness. ResultsWater chemistry and physical variables had significant effects on the community composition of both microbial groups. Catchment level variables explained a slightly larger amount of variation in diatom community composition than local level variables. Agriculture was the most significant determinant of variation in diatom community composition among catchment level variables and was also related with variation in the richness of both groups. Of spatial and climatic variables, growing degree days (GDD) and spatial variables were the most significant drivers determining diatom community composition. GDD was also positively associated with the richness of diatoms and bacteria. Unique effects of spatial and climate variables accounted for the largest amount of variation in the community composition of both diatoms and bacteria. Main conclusionsOur results highlight that aquatic microbial communities can exhibit biogeographical variation at regional scales due to the joint influence of local, catchment and climatic variables, and possibly because of dispersal limitation. Catchment properties, especially agriculture, can be used as a proxy for the effects of landscape alteration on aquatic microbial communities.","2017","44","10.1111/jbi.13002","me","not yet"

Belowground organisms regulate numerous ecosystem functions, yet we lack understanding of what drives their diversity. Here, we examine the controls on belowground diversity along latitudinal and elevational gradients. We performed a global meta-analysis of 325 soil communities across 20 studies conducted along temperature and soil pH gradients. Belowground taxa, whether bacterial or fungal, observed along a given gradient of temperature or soil pH were equally likely to show a linear increase, linear decrease, humped pattern, trough-shaped pattern, or no pattern in diversity along the gradient. Land-use intensity weakly affected the diversity-temperature relationship, but no other factor did so. Our study highlights disparities among diversity patterns of soil microbial communities. Belowground diversity may be controlled by the associated climatic and historical contexts of particular gradients, by factors not typically measured in community-level studies, or by processes operating at scales that do not match the temporal and spatial scales under study. Because these organisms are responsible for a suite of key processes, understanding the drivers of their distribution and diversity is fundamental to understanding the functioning of ecosystems.","2017","98","10.1002/ecy.1829","me","not yet"

Continental scale patterns in the composition and functioning of microbial communities are related to climatic, biotic, and edaphic factors such as temperature and precipitation, plant community composition, and soil carbon, nitrogen, and pH. Although these relationships have been well explored individually, the examination of the factors that may act directly on microbial communities vs. those that may act indirectly through other ecosystem properties has not been well developed. To further such understanding, we utilized structural equation modeling (SEM) to evaluate a set of hypotheses about the direct and indirect effects of climatic, biotic, and edaphic variables on microbial communities across the continental United States. The primary goals of this work were to test our current understanding of the interactions among climate, soils, and plants in affecting microbial community composition, and to examine whether variation in the composition of the microbial community affects potential rates of soil enzymatic activities. A model of interacting factors created through SEM shows several expected patterns. Distal factors such as climate had indirect effects on microbial communities by influencing plant productivity, soil mineralogy, and soil pH, but factors related to soil organic matter chemistry had the most direct influence on community composition. We observed that both plant productivity and soil mineral composition were important indirect influences on community composition at the continental scale, both interacting to affect organic matter content and microbial biomass and ultimately community composition. Although soil hydrolytic enzymes were related to the moisture regime and soil carbon, oxidative enzymes were also affected by community composition, reflected in the abundance of soil fungi. These results highlight that soil microbial communities can be modeled within the context of multiple interacting ecosystem properties acting both directly and indirectly on their composition and function, and this provides a rich and informative context with which to examine communities. This work also highlights that variation in climate, microbial biomass, and microbial community composition can affect maximum rates of soil enzyme activities, potentially influencing rates of decomposition and nutrient mineralization in soils.","2017","98","10.1002/ecy.1883","me","not yet"

We present species composition, diversity, and dispersal patterns of endophytic fungi associated with needles of Pinus taeda trees across regional scales in the absence of strong environmental gradients as well as within individual trees. An empirical designation of rare and abundant taxa enlightens us on the structure of endophyte communities. We report multiple distance-decay patterns consistent with effects of dispersal limitation, largely driven by community changes in rare taxa, those taxonomic units that made up less than 0.31% of reads per sample on average. Distance-decay rates and community structure also depended on specific classes of fungi and were predominantly influenced by rare members of Dothideomycetes. Communities separated by urban areas also revealed stronger effects of distance on community similarity, confirming that host density and diversity plays an important role in symbiont biogeography, which may ultimately lead to a mosaic of functional diversity as well as rare species diversity across landscapes.","2017","19","10.1111/1462-2920.13799","me","not yet"

We assessed soil fungal diversity and community composition of five Chinese zonal forests along a latitudinal gradient spanning 23 degrees N to 42 degrees N in three seasons to address these questions. We found that soil fungal diversity increased linearly or parabolically with latitude. The seasonal variations in fungal diversity were more distinguishable in three temperate deciduous forests than in two subtropical evergreen forests. Soil fungal diversity was mainly correlated with edaphic factors such as pH and nutrient contents. Both latitude and its interactions with season also imposed significant impacts on soil fungal community composition (FCC), but the effects of latitude were stronger than those of season. Vegetational properties such as plant diversity and forest age were the dominant factors affecting FCC in the subtropical evergreen forests while edaphic properties were the dominant ones in the temperate deciduous forests. Our results indicate that latitudinal variation patterns of soil fungal diversity and FCC may differ among seasons. The stronger effect of latitude relative to that of season suggests a more important influence by the spatial than temporal heterogeneity in shaping soil fungal communities across zonal forests.","2017","93","10.1093/femsec/fix069","me","not yet"

LocationThe southern Appalachian Mountains, USA. MethodsWe conducted fine-scale population-level sampling and screening of DNA sequence variation in two mitochondrial genes from the host, and four genic or intergenic regions from the endosymbiont. Inferences were made using analyses that have the potential to identify isolated instances of cophylogenetic discord, uncover subtle differences in geographic locations of genetic discontinuities, and disentangle different evolutionary processes that contributed to observed patterns. ResultsThe host and its endosymbiont showed similar phylogenetic and geographic patterns. Cophylogenetic analyses revealed that while topological discord is rare (and restricted within major clades), some instances are potentially non-negligible. Assessments of spatial-genetic structure showed that most abrupt breaks occur in the same locations, but they differ in strength, again underscoring some subtle discordance. The main process generating observed patterns was inferred to be codivergence due to host-tracking; however, incomplete lineage sorting seems likely to have also played a minor role. Main conclusionsOur overarching finding of strong congruence is reflected by broader-scale cophylogenetic studies of related Cryptocercus and Blattabacterium taxa. Accordingly, we suggest that members of this symbiosis may provide an excellent opportunity for investigating geographic scaling of processes that affect biogeographic patterns. However, fine-scale sampling coupled with geospatial analyses detected rare and/or minor discordances that appeared to be localized within the most deeply dissected topographic regions of the southern Appalachian Mountains, and these warrant further exploration.","2017","44","10.1111/jbi.12992","me","not yet"

Microbial communities from 17 skin sites of 10 sexually active cohabiting couples (20 individuals) were sampled to test whether cohabitation impacts an individuals skin microbiome, leading to shared skin microbiota among partner pairs. Amplified 16S rRNA genes of bacteria and archaea from a total of 340 skin swabs were analyzed by high-throughput sequencing, and the results demonstrated that cohabitation was significantly associated with microbial community composition, although this association was greatly exceeded by characteristics of body location and individuality. Random forest modeling demonstrated that the partners could be predicted 86% of the time (P < 0.001) based on their skin microbiome profiles, which was always greater than combinations of incorrectly matched partners. Cohabiting couples had the most similar overall microbial skin communities on their feet, according to BrayCurtis distances. In contrast, thigh microbial communities were strongly associated with biological sex rather than cohabiting partner. Additional factors that were associated with the skin microbiome of specific body locations included the use of skin care products, pet ownership, allergies, and alcohol consumption. These baseline data identified links between the skin microbiome and daily interactions among cohabiting individuals, adding to known factors that shape the human microbiome and, by extension, its relation to human health. IMPORTANCE Our work characterizes the influence of cohabitation as a factor influencing the composition of the skin microbiome. Although the body site and sampled individual were stronger influences than other factors collected as metadata in this study, we show that modeling of detected microbial taxa can help with correct identifications of cohabiting partners based on skin microbiome profiles using machine learning approaches. These results show that a cohabiting partner can significantly influence our microbiota.

"Aizenberg-Gershtein, Y; Izhaki, I; Halpern, M","From Microhabitat of Floral Nectar Up to Biogeographic Scale: Novel Insights on Neutral and Niche Bacterial Assemblies","MICROBIAL ECOLOGY","Microbial model systems are very useful in addressing macro-ecological questions. Two major theories exist to date, to explain the community structure of organisms: (1) the dispersal (neutral) assembly theory which predicts that community similarity decreases with increasing geographic distance, independent of any environmental variables, and (2) the niche assembly theory which predicts that the communities compositions are more homogeneous among sites characterized by similar environmental conditions. Our study system offered a unique opportunity to investigate the relative role of environmental conditions and spatial factors in shaping community composition. We explored the bacterial community composition (BCC) of Nicotiana glauca floral nectar using the Illumina MiSeq technique at three spatial scales (plants, site, and region) and two taxonomic levels. Floral nectar samples were collected from 69 N. glauca plants at 11 different sites along a 200-km transect in Israel, along three biogeographic regions. A distance decay of BCC was found among all plants throughout Israel, but such pattern was not found among either sites or biogeographical regions. The BCC was also governed by environmental conditions in all examined scales (from the plant up to the biogeographical region). We also found that taxonomic resolution (89 and 97% sequence identity for clustering operational taxonomic units) affected the results of these BCC analyses. Hence, our study revealed that the BCC in N. glauca floral nectar is shaped by both the environmental conditions and the distance between plants, depending on the sampling scale under examination as well as by taxonomic resolution.","2017","74","10.1007/s00248-017-0935-9","me","not yet"

At the two stations studied, the photosynthetic biomass was dominated by protists >3 mu m and was concentrated in the upper 7080 m, above the thermocline and halocline. Hierarchical cluster analyses as well as ordination analyses showed a distinct clustering of the microbial eukaryote communities according to a combination of water mass and local environmental characteristics. While samples collected in the surface mixed layer differed distinctly between the two sites, the deeper communities collected in Atlantic Water were fairly similar despite being geographically distant. The differentiation of the microbial eukaryote communities of the upper mixed water was probably driven by local development and advection, while the lack of such differentiation in the communities of Atlantic Water reflects the homogenizing effect of water currents on microbial communities.","2017","8","10.3389/fmicb.2017.01099","me","not yet"
"Nunan, N; Leloup, J; Ruamps, LS; Pouteau, V; Chenu, C","Effects of habitat constraints on soil microbial community function","SCIENTIFIC REPORTS","An underlying assumption of most soil carbon (C) dynamics models is that soil microbial communities are functionally similar; in other words, that microbial activity under given conditions is not dependent on the composition or diversity of the communities. Although a number of studies have indicated that microbial communities are not intrinsically functionally similar, most soil C dynamics models can adequately describe C dynamics without explicitly describing microbial functioning. Here, we provide a mechanistic basis for reconciling this apparent discrepancy. In a reciprocal transplant experiment, we show that the environmental context (soil and pore-network properties) of microbial communities can constrain the activity of functionally different communities to such an extent that their activities are indistinguishable. The data also suggest that when microbial activity is less constrained, the intrinsic functional differences among communities can be expressed. We conclude that soil C dynamics may depend on microbial community structure or diversity in environments where their activity is less constrained, such as the rhizosphere or the litter layer, but not in oligotrophic environments such as the mineral layers of soil.","2017","7","10.1038/s41598-017-04485-z","me","not yet"

As we know, an ideal molecular marker used in molecular identification and phylogenetic studies is homogeneous within species, and interspecific variation exceeds intraspecific variation. However, during our process of performing ITS, RPB2, and EF1a sequencing on the Pleurotus spp., we found that intra-isolate sequence polymorphism might be present in these genes because direct sequencing of PCR products failed in some isolates. Therefore, we detected intra-and inter-isolate variation of the three genes in Pleurotus by polymerase chain reaction amplification and cloning in this study. Results: Results showed that intra-isolate variation of ITS was not uncommon but the polymorphic level in each isolate was relatively low in Pleurotus; intra-isolate variations of EF1a and RPB2 sequences were present in an unexpectedly high amount. The polymorphism level differed significantly between ITS, RPB2, and EF1a in the same individual, and the intra-isolate heterogeneity level of each gene varied between isolates within the same species. Intra-isolate and intraspecific variation of ITS in the tested isolates was less than interspecific variation, and intra-isolate and intraspecific variation of RPB2 was probably equal with interspecific divergence. Meanwhile, intra-isolate and intraspecific variation of EF1a could exceed interspecific divergence. These findings suggested that RPB2 and EF1a are not desirable barcoding candidates for Pleurotus. We also discussed the reason why rDNA and protein-coding genes showed variants within a single isolate in Pleurotus, but must be addressed in further research. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that intra-isolate variation of ribosomal and protein-coding genes are likely widespread in fungi.

With the advent of rapid, high throughput, next generation sequencing, there is a growing appreciation of the importance of commensal microbial populations in maintaining mucosal health, and a realization that bacteria colonize anatomical locations that were previously considered to be sterile. While upper respiratory tract microbial populations have been described, there are currently no published studies describing the normal microbial populations of the bovine lower respiratory tract. Consequently, we have little understanding of the relationship between upper and lower respiratory tract microbiota in healthy cattle. The primary objective of our study was to characterize the composition, structure and relationship of the lower and upper respiratory microbial communities in clinically healthy feedlot cattle. Nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS), and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, were collected from clinically healthy feedlot calves (n = 8). Genomic DNA from each sample was extracted, and the V3-V4 hypervariable region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced using Illumina Miseq platform. Results: Across all samples, the most predominant phyla were Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Firmicutes. The most common genera were Rathayibacter, Mycoplasma, Bibersteinia and Corynebacterium. The microbial community structure was distinct between these two biogeographical sites. Most of the bacterial genera identified in the BAL samples were also present in the NPS, but biogeographical-specific genera were enriched in both the NPS (Rathayibacter) and BAL (Bibersteinia) samples. There were strong associations between the presence of certain taxa at each specific location, and strong correlations between the presence of specific taxa in both the NPS and BAL samples. Conclusions: The correlation between the presence of specific taxa in both the NPS and BAL samples, supports the notion of a mutualistic interrelationship between these microbial communities. Future studies, in large cohorts of animals, are needed to determine the role and clinical importance of the relationships of respiratory tract microbial communities with health, productivity, and susceptibility to the development of respiratory disease, in growing cattle.","2017","17","10.1186/s12866-017-1042-2","me","not yet"

Functional gene diversity and the structure of the microbial community determines its metabolic potential and therefore its ecological function in the marine ecosystem. However, little is known about the functional gene composition and metabolic potential of bacterioplankton in estuary areas. The East China Sea (ECS) is a dynamic marginal ecosystem in the western Pacific Ocean that is mainly affected by input from the Changjiang River and the Kuroshio Current. Here, using a high-throughput functional gene microarray (GeoChip), we analyzed the functional gene diversity, composition, structure, and metabolic potential of microbial assemblages in different ECS water masses. Four water masses determined by temperature and salinity relationship showed different patterns of functional gene diversity and composition. Generally, functional gene diversity [Shannon-Weaners H and reciprocal of Simpsons 1/(1-D)] in the surface water masses was higher than that in the bottom water masses. The different presence and proportion of functional genes involved in C, N, and P cycling among the bacteria of the different water masses showed different metabolic preferences of the microbial populations in the ECS. Genes involved in starch metabolism (amyA and nplT) showed higher proportion in microbial communities of the surface water masses than of the bottom water masses. In contrast, a higher proportion of genes involved in chitin degradation was observed in microorganisms of the bottom water masses. Moreover, we found a higher proportion of nitrogen fixation (nifH), transformation of hydroxylamine to nitrite (hao) and ammonification (gdh) genes in the microbial communities of the bottom water masses compared with those of the surface water masses. The spatial variation of microbial functional genes was significantly correlated with salinity, temperature, and chlorophyll a based on canonical correspondence analysis, suggesting a significant influence of hydrologic conditions on water microbial communities. Our data provide new insights into better understanding of the functional potential of microbial communities in the complex estuarine-coastal environmental gradient of the ECS.","2017","8","10.3389/fmicb.2017.01153","me","not yet"

To reveal the responses of bacterial communities to long-term switchgrass cultivation through the soil profile, we examined the shift of soil microbial communities with depth profiles of 0-60 cm in five-year switchgrass cultivation and fallow plots. The Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene showed that switchgrass cultivation significantly increased microbial OTU richness, rather than microbial Shannon diversity; however, there was no significant difference in the structure of microbial communities between switchgrass cultivation and fallow soils. Both switchgrass cultivation and fallow soils exhibited significant negative vertical spatial decay of microbial similarity, indicating that more vertical depth distant soils had more dissimilar communities. Specifically, switchgrass cultivation soils showed more beta-diversity variations across soil depth profile. Through network analysis, more connections and closer relationships of microbial taxa were observed in soils under switchgrass cultivation, suggesting that microbial co-occurrence patterns were substantially influenced by switchgrass cultivation. Overall, our study suggested that five-year switchgrass cultivation could generated more beta-diversity variations across soil depth and more complex inter-relationships of microbial taxa, although did not significantly shape the structure of soil microbial community.","2017","7","10.1038/s41598-017-03778-7","me","not yet"

While great progress has been made in describing this diversity, it remains difficult to identify the phylogenetic and ecological characteristics that delineate groups of bacteria that possess species-like properties. One major challenge associated with species delineations is that not all shared genes have the same evolutionary history, and thus the choice of loci can have a major impact on phylogenetic reconstruction. Sequencing the genomes of large numbers of closely related strains provides new opportunities to distinguish ancestral from acquired alleles and assess the effects of recombination on phylogenetic inference. Here we analyzed the genomes of 119 strains of the marine actinomycete genus Salinispora, which is currently comprised of three named species that share 99% 16S rRNA gene sequence identity. While 63% of the core genome showed evidence of recombination, this had no effect on species-level phylogenomic resolution. Recombination did however blur intra-species relationships and biogeographic resolution. The genome-wide average nucleotide identity provided a new perspective on Salinispora diversity, revealing as many as seven new species. Patterns of orthologous group distributions reveal a genetic basis to delineation the candidate taxa and insight into the levels of genetic cohesion associated with bacterial species.","2017","7","10.1038/s41598-017-02845-3","me","not yet"

V9 regions of both SSU rRNA gene and its transcript (cDNA) were amplified and sequenced using high throughput sequencing. Our study revealed: (1) DNA and RNA datasets showed significant differences in microbial eukaryote community composition, with the variability between the two datasets for the same sample exceeding that between samples within each dataset, indicating that nucleic acid source overrode environmental factors in determining the composition of microeukaryotes; (2) despite the differences in community composition between the two datasets, both DNA and RNA revealed similar depth-related distribution patterns of microbial eukaryotes; (3) using the ratio of RNA: DNA as a proxy of relative metabolic activity, a depth-related pattern was found for the relative metabolic activity of some but not all groups of microbial eukaryotes, with the highest activity for the groups with depth-related pattern usually found in the middle water layers; and (4) the presence of live and active photoautotrophic microbial eukaryotes in the deep ocean was confirmed, indicating that they play an important role in controlling the deep-sea organic carbon pool.

Given the importance of microbial communities in driving soil nutrient cycling, it is of interest to document the microbial biogeographic pattern here. We adopted a microarray-based tool named GeoChip 4.0 to investigate grassland microbial functional genes along an elevation gradient from 3200 to 3800 m above sea level open to free grazing by local herdsmen and wild animals. Interestingly, microbial functional diversities increase with elevation, so does the relative abundances of genes associated with carbon degradation, nitrogen cycling, methane production, cold shock and oxygen limitation. The range of Shannon diversities (10.27-10.58) showed considerably smaller variation than what was previously observed at ungrazed sites nearby (9.95-10.65), suggesting the important role of livestock grazing on microbial diversities. Closer examination showed that the dissimilarity of microbial community at our study sites increased with elevations, revealing an elevation-decay relationship of microbial functional genes. Both microbial functional diversity and the number of unique genes increased with elevations. Furthermore, we detected a tight linkage of greenhouse gas (CO2) and relative abundances of carbon cycling genes.

Current knowledge of primary succession is mainly from studies of vegetation dynamics, whereas information about belowground microbes remains unclear. Here, we combined shifts in community assembly processes with microbial primary succession to better understand mechanisms governing the stochastic/deterministic balance. We investigated fungal succession and community assembly via high-throughput sequencing along a well-established glacier forefront chronosequence that spans 2-188 years of deglaciation. Shannon diversity and evenness peaked at a distance of 370m and declined afterwards. The response of fungal diversity to distance varied in different phyla. Basidiomycota Shannon diversity significantly decreased with distance, while the pattern of Rozellomycota Shannon diversity was unimodal. Abundance of most frequencies OTU2 (Cryptococcus terricola) increased with successional distance, whereas that of OTU65 (Tolypocladium tundrense) decreased. Based on null deviation analyses, composition of the fungal community was initially governed by deterministic processes strongly but later less deterministic processes. Our results revealed that distance, altitude, soil microbial biomass carbon, soil microbial biomass nitrogen and NH4+-N significantly correlated with fungal community composition along the chronosequence. These results suggest that the drivers of fungal community are dynamics in a glacier chronosequence, that may relate to fungal ecophysiological traits and adaptation in an evolving ecosystem. The information will provide understanding the mechanistic underpinnings of microbial community assembly during ecosystem succession under different scales and scenario.","2017","8","10.3389/fmicb.2017.01028","me","not yet"

Here, we assess how many marine species are named and estimated to exist, paying particular regard to whether discoveries of deep-sea organisms, microbes and parasites will change the proportion of terrestrial to marine species. We then review what factors have led to species diversification, and how this knowledge informs conservation priorities. The implications of this understanding for marine conservation are that the species most vulnerable to extinction will be large and endemic. Unfortunately, these species are also the most threatened by human impacts. Such threats now extend globally, and thus the only refuges for these species will be large, permanent, fully protected marine reserves.","2017","27","10.1016/j.cub.2017.04.060","me","not yet"

Coastal lakes are recipients of, and thus are connected to, both marine and terrestrial environments. Thus, they may host microbial assemblages that reflect the relative degree of influence by, and connectivity to, either system. In order to address this idea, we interrogated microbial community diversity at 49 sites in seven ponds in two seasons in the Lake MacLeod basin, a system fed by seawater flowing inland through underground karst. Environmental and spatial variation within ponds explain <9% of the community structure, while identity of the pond that samples were taken from explains 50% of community variation. That is, ponds each host distinct assemblages despite similarities in size, environment and position in the landscape, indicating a dominant role for local species sorting. The ponds contain a substantial amount of previously unknown microbial taxa, reflecting the unusual nature of this inland system. Rare marine taxa, possibly dispersed from seawater assemblages via the underground karst connection, are abundant within the inland system, suggesting an important role for regional dispersal within the metacommunities.","2017","93","10.1093/femsec/fix067","me","not yet"

No studies have addressed the microbial community composition of cryoconite holes and their associated ecosystem processes on Tibetan glaciers. To further enhance our understanding of these glacial ecosystems on the Tibetan Plateau and to examine their role in carbon cycling as the glaciers respond to climate change, we explored the bacterial communities within cryoconite holes associated with three climatically distinct Tibetan Plateau glaciers using Illumina sequencing of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Cryoconite bacterial communities were dominated by Cyanobacteria, Chloroflexi, Betaproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria. Cryoconite bacterial community composition varied according to their geographical locations, exhibiting significant differences among glaciers studied. Regional beta diversity was driven by the interaction between geographic distance and environmental variables; the latter contributed more than geographic distance to the variation in cryoconite microbial communities.

Recent work comparing three genome sequences of Sulfolobus acidocaldarius suggested that highly structured, extreme, hot spring environments do not limit dispersal of this thermoacidophile, in contrast to other co-occurring Sulfolobus species. Instead, a high level of conservation among these three S. acidocaldarius genomes was hypothesized to result from rapid, global-scale dispersal promoted by low susceptibility to viruses that sets S. acidocaldarius apart from its sister Sulfolobus species. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a comparative analysis of 47 genomes of S. acidocaldarius from spatial and temporal sampling of two hot springs in Yellowstone National Park. While we confirm the low diversity in the core genome, we observe differentiation among S. acidocaldarius populations, likely resulting from low migration among hot spring islands in Yellowstone National Park. Patterns of genomic variation indicate that differing geological contexts result in the elimination or preservation of diversity among differentiated populations. We observe multiple deletions associated with a large genomic island rich in glycosyltransferases, differential integrations of the Sulfolobus turreted icosahedral virus, as well as two different plasmid elements. These data demonstrate that neither rapid dispersal nor lack of mobile genetic elements result in low diversity in the S. acidocaldarius genomes. We suggest instead that significant differences in the recent evolutionary history, or the intrinsic evolutionary rates, of sister Sulfolobus species result in the relatively low diversity of the S. acidocaldarius genome.","2017","9","10.1093/gbe/evx104","me","not yet"

Microorganisms on glaciers form consortia - cryoconite granules (cryoconites). They are granular/spherical mineral particles connected with archaea, cyanobacteria, heterotrophic bacteria, algae, fungi, and micro animals (mainly Tardigrada and Rotifera). Cryophilic organisms inhabiting glaciers have been studied in different aspects: from taxonomy, ecology and biogeography, to searching of biotechnological potentials and physiological strategies to survive in extreme glacial habitats. However, they have never been used in astrobiological experiments. The main aim of this paper is brief review of literature and supporting assumptions that cryoconite granules and microinvertebrates on glaciers, are promising models in astrobiology for looking for analogies and survival strategies in terms of icy planets and moons. So far, astrobiological research have been conducted on single strains of prokaryotes or microinvertebrates but never on a consortium of them. Due to the hypothetical similarity of glaciers on the Earth to those on other planets these cryoconites consortia of microorganisms and glacier microinvertebrates may be applied in astrobiological experiments instead of the limno-terrestrial ones used currently. Those consortia and animals have qualities to use them in such studies and they may be the key to understanding how organisms are able to survive, reproduce and remain active at low temperatures.","2017","6","10.1515/ctg-2017-0001","me","not yet"

To understand such interactions in detail, we investigated how the salivary microbiome in the oral cavity would be regulated by host-related signals. Here, we show that the microbial abundance and gene participating in keeping the human salivary microbiome exhibit global circadian rhythm. Analysis of the 16S rRNA sequences of salivary microbial samples of six healthy adults collected at 4-h intervals for three days revealed that the microbial genera accounting for 68.4-89.6% of the total abundance were observed to significantly oscillate with the periodicity of 24 h. These oscillation patterns showed high variations amongst individuals, and the extent of circadian variations in individuals was generally lower than that of interindividual variations. Of the microbial categories oscillated, those classified by aerobic/anaerobic growth and Gram staining, Firmicutes including Streptococcus and Gemella, and Bacteroidetes including Prevotella showed high association with the circadian oscillation. The circadian oscillation was completely abolished by incubating the saliva in vitro, suggesting that hosts physiological changes mostly contributed to the microbial oscillation. Further metagenomic analysis showed that circadian oscillation enriched the functions of environmental responses such as various transporters and two-component regulatory systems in the evening, and those of metabolisms such as the biosynthesis of vitamins and fatty acids in the morning.","2017","24","10.1093/dnares/dsx001","me","not yet"

They may be free-living or attached, specialized for particular concentrations or subsets of substrates, or invest a variable amount of their resources in defence traits against protistan predators and viruses. Some may be motile and tactic whereas others are not, with far-reaching implications for their respective life styles and niche partitioning. The co-occurrence of competitors with overlapping growth requirements has profound consequences for the stability of community functions; it can to some extent be explained by habitat factors such as the microscale complexity and spatiotemporal variability of the lacustrine environments. On the other hand, the composition and diversity of freshwater microbial assemblages also reflects non-equilibrium states, dispersal and the stochasticity of community assembly processes. This review synoptically discusses the competition and niche separation of heterotrophic bacterial populations (defined at various levels of phylogenetic resolution) in the pelagic zone of inland surface waters from a variety of angles, focusing on habitat heterogeneity and the resulting biogeographic distribution patterns, the ecophysiological adaptations to the substrate field and the interactions of prokaryotes with predators and viruses.","2017","19","10.1111/1462-2920.13742","me","not yet"

Here, we investigated the seasonal variation in the importance of dispersal from different sources (mixing, precipitation, surface runoff and sediment resuspension) for lake bacterioplankton community and population dynamics. For that purpose, two small forest lakes and their dispersal sources were sampled over a period of 10 months. The influence of dispersal on communities and populations was determined by 454 sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and SourceTracker analysis. On the community level direct effects of dispersal were questionable from all sources. Instead we found that the community of the preceding sampling occasion, representing growth of resident bacteria, was of great importance. On the population level, however, dispersal of individual taxa from the inlet could be occasionally important even under low water flow.

The results showed that with an increasing altitude gradient, soil physicochemical properties such as total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC), water-soluble organic nitrogen (WSON) and pH decreased coincident with a decrease in mean annual temperature (MAT). Bacteria biomass, fungal biomass and actinobacterial biomass all decreased with an increase in altitude gradient. The ratio of Gram-positive bacteria to Gram-negative bacteria and the ratio of cyclopropyl to precursor fatty acids all indicate that the level of environmental harshness intensified with an increase in altitude. We also found that soil enzyme activities such as phenol oxidase, peroxidase, L-asparaginase, protease, urease and alkaline phosphatase all consistently decreased with an increase in altitude gradient. Additionally, the activities of peroxidase, protease and alkaline phosphatase declined, mainly due to a reduction in enzyme activities with temperature rather than the reduction of associated microbial biomass. Statistical analysis showed that both microbial biomass and enzyme activities were significantly influenced by mean annual temperature, suggesting that temperature is a key factor that affects microbial communities and soil enzyme activities in alpine wetlands on the Tibetan Plateau and indicating that climate warming may significantly impact these areas.","2017","37","10.1007/s13157-017-0876-6","me","not yet"

However, knowledge about patterns in microbial aerobiology is still relatively scarce, and this can be attributed, in part, to a lack of consensus on appropriate sampling and analytical methodology. In this study, three different methods were used to investigate aerial biodiversity over Svalbard: impaction, membrane filtration and drop plates. Sites around Svalbard were selected due to their relatively remote location, low human population, geographical location with respect to air movement and the tradition and history of scientific investigation on the archipelago, ensuring the presence of existing research infrastructure. The aerial bacterial biodiversity found was similar to that described in other aerobiological studies from both polar and non-polar environments, with Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes being the predominant groups. Twelve different phyla were detected in the air collected above Svalbard, although the diversity was considerably lower than in urban environments elsewhere. However, only 58 of 196 bacterial genera detected were consistently present, suggesting potentially higher levels of heterogeneity. Viable bacteria were present at all sampling locations, showing that living bacteria are ubiquitous in the air around Svalbard. Sampling location influenced the results obtained, as did sampling method.

Unexpectedly, genes involved in As biotransformation were characterized by high abundance and diversity. The functional microbial communities showed a significant decrease in similarity along the geographic distance, with higher turnover rates than taxonomic microbial communities based on the similarities of 16S rRNA genes. Further investigation with niche-based models showed that deterministic processes played primary roles in shaping both functional and taxonomic microbial communities.

However, our knowledge of the way geographically distant microbial communities assemble after dispersal in a new environment is limited. In this study, we examined whether communities would converge because similar taxa would be selected under the same environmental conditions, or would diverge because of initial community composition, after artificial dispersal. To this aim, a microcosm experiment was performed, in which the temporal changes in the composition and diversity of different prokaryoplankton assemblages from three distant geographic coastal areas (Banyuls-sur-Mer in northwest Mediterranean Sea, Pagasitikos Gulf in northeast Mediterranean and Woods Hole, MA, USA in the northwest Atlantic), were studied. Diversity was investigated using amplicon pyrosequencing of the V1-V3 hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA. The three assemblages were grown separately in particle free and autoclaved Banyuls-sur-mer seawater at 18 degrees C in the dark. We found that the variability of prokaryoplankton community diversity (expressed as richness, evenness and dominance) as well as the composition were driven by patterns observed in Bacteria. Regarding community composition, similarities were found between treatments at family level. However, at the OTU level microbial communities from the three different original locations diverge rather than converge during incubation. It is suggested that slight differences in the composition of the initial prokaryoplankton communities, resulted in separate clusters the following days even when growth took place under identical abiotic conditions.","2017","5","10.3390/microorganisms5020031","me","not yet"

Environmental conditions affect the microbial community assembly via direct and indirect interactions with microbes, resulting in an environmentally dependent biogeographic pattern. This article summarizes the latest studies to provide a better understanding of the microbial biodiversity and community assembly in AMD environments.","2017","7","10.3390/min7060106","me","not yet"
"Hutchins, DA; Fu, FX","Microorganisms and ocean global change","NATURE MICROBIOLOGY","The prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms that drive the pelagic oceans biogeochemical cycles are currently facing an unprecedented set of comprehensive anthropogenic changes. Nearly every important control on marine microbial physiology is currently in flux, including seawater pH, p(CO2), temperature, redox chemistry, irradiance and nutrient availability. Here, we examine how microorganisms with key roles in the ocean carbon and nitrogen cycles may respond to these changes in the Earths largest ecosystem. Some functional groups such as nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria and denitrifiers may be net beneficiaries of these changes, while others such as calcifiers and nitrifiers may be negatively impacted. Other groups, such as heterotrophic bacteria, may be relatively resilient to changing conditions. The challenge for marine microbiologists will be to predict how these divergent future responses of marine microorganisms to complex multiple variable interactions will be expressed through changing biogeography, community structure and adaptive evolution, and ultimately through large-scale alterations of the oceans carbon and nutrient cycles.","2017","2","10.1038/nmicrobiol.2017.58","me","not yet"

For microbes, assessing endemism in the Antarctic region has been particularly important, especially against a backdrop of debate regarding their presumed cosmopolitan nature. To contribute to this conversation, we highlight the observed endemism of the freshwater diatom genus Luticola in Antarctica by synthesizing the results of a modern high-resolution taxonomy from the Continental, Maritime, and sub-Antarctic regions. We report that Luticola has one of the highest endemic rates of any diatom genus in Antarctica, in terms of total number of species (taxon endemism) and percentage of the entire genus (phylogenetic endemism). Of the over 200 species of Luticola globally, nearly 20% (43) occur in the Antarctic, with 42 of these being endemic. Within regions, Maritime Antarctica has the largest number of Luticola species and endemics (28 and 23, respectively), followed by Continental Antarctica (14, 9) and sub-Antarctic islands (8, 6). Thus, 38 of the 42 endemics are found in a single region only. While the timing of Luticola diversification has not been established, fossil evidence suggests recent invasions and/or diversification over a relatively short geologic timescale. Understanding the origin and evolution of endemic diatom species in Antarctica will help us better understand microbial biogeography, as well as assess and interpret impacts of large-scale environmental change taking place at southern latitudes.","2017","40","10.1007/s00300-017-2090-7","me","not yet"

Microbial community in paddy soils is of great interest since many microorganisms are involved in soil functional processes. In the present study, Illumina Mi-Seq sequencing and functional gene array (GeoChip 4.2) techniques were combined to investigate soil microbial communities and functional gene patterns across the three soil types including an Inceptisol (Binhai), an Oxisol (Leizhou), and an Ultisol (Taoyuan) along four profile depths (up to 70 cm in depth) in mesocosm incubation columns. Detrended correspondence analysis revealed that distinctly differentiation in microbial community existed among soil types and profile depths, while the manifest variance in functional structure was only observed among soil types and two rice growth stages, but not across profile depths. Along the profile depth within each soil type, Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Firmicutes increased whereas Cyanobacteria, beta-proteobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia declined, suggesting their specific ecophysiological properties. Compared to bacterial community, the archaeal community showed a more contrasting pattern with the predominant groups within phyla Euryarchaeota, Thaumarchaeota, and Crenarchaeota largely varying among soil types and depths. Phylogenetic molecular ecological network (pMEN) analysis further indicated that the pattern of bacterial and archaeal communities interactions changed with soil depth and the highest modularity of microbial community occurred in top soils, implying a relatively higher system resistance to environmental change compared to communities in deeper soil layers. Meanwhile, microbial communities had higher connectivity in deeper soils in comparison with upper soils, suggesting less microbial interaction in surface soils. Structure equation models were developed and the models indicated that pH was the most representative characteristics of soil type and identified as the key driver in shaping both bacterial and archaeal community structure, but did not directly affect microbial functional structure. The distinctive pattern of microbial taxonomic and functional composition along soil profiles implied functional redundancy within these paddy soils.","2017","8","10.3389/fmicb.2017.00945","me","not yet"

River communities varied among tributaries, but mainstem communities were spatially homogeneous and tracked seasonal changes in river discharge and co-varying factors. Co-occurrence network analysis identified strongly interconnected river assemblages during high (May) and low (December) discharge periods, and weakly interconnected transitional assemblages in September, suggesting that this system supports two seasonal microbial communities linked to river discharge. In contrast, plume communities showed little seasonal differences and instead varied spatially tracking salinity. However, salinity explained only a small fraction of community variability, and plume communities in blooms of diatom-diazotroph assemblages were strikingly different than those in other high salinity plume samples. This suggests that while salinity physically structures plumes through buoyancy and mixing, the composition of plume-specific communities is controlled by other factors including nutrients, phytoplankton community composition, and dissolved organic matter chemistry. Co-occurrence networks identified interconnected assemblages associated with the highly productive low salinity near-shore region, diatom-diazotroph blooms, and the plume edge region, and weakly interconnected assemblages in high salinity regions. This suggests that the plume supports a transitional community influenced by immigration of ocean bacteria from the plume edge, and by species sorting as these communities adapt to local environmental conditions. Few studies have explored patterns of microbial diversity in tropical rivers and coastal oceans. Comparison of Amazon continuum microbial communities to those from temperate and arctic systems suggest that river discharge and salinity are master variables structuring a range of environmental conditions that control bacterial communities across the river-ocean continuum.","2017","8","10.3389/fmicb.2017.00882","me","not yet"

In culture, however, most viral isolates that infect microbes are represented by a few variants isolated on type strains, limiting our ability to study how natural variation affects virus-host interactions in the laboratory. We screened a set of 137 hot spring samples for viruses that infect a geographically diverse panel of the hyperthemophilic crenarchaeon Sulfolobus islandicus. We isolated and characterized eight SIRVs (Sulfolobus islandicus rod-shaped viruses) from two different regions within Yellowstone National Park (USA). Comparative genomics revealed that all SIRV sequenced isolates share 30 core genes that represent 50-60% of the genome. The core genome phylogeny, as well as the distribution of variable genes (shared by some but not all SIRVs) and the signatures of host-virus interactions recorded on the CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) repeat-spacer arrays of S. islandicus hosts, identify different SIRV lineages, each associated with a different geographic location. Moreover, our studies reveal that SIRV core genes do not appear to be under diversifying selection and thus we predict that the abundant and diverse variable genes govern the coevolutionary arms race between SIRVs and their hosts.","2017","9","10.3390/v9050120","me","not yet"

We combined backscattered scanning electron microscopy and high-throughput sequencing to identify major taxa in each band. We confirmed the presence of algal and fungal lichen symbionts, cyanobacteria and free-living algae, plus a diverse heterotrophic bacterial and archaeal component. A clear delineation at the community level was observed. The relatively biodiverse and heterogenous lichen communities occurred in weathered sandstone cliffs, whilst in granite and sandstone boulders, cyanobacterial communities were dominant.

The rice bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola (Xoc) has been demonstrated to contain a biosynthetic operon with cyclases capable of producing the universal GA precursor ent-kaurene. Genetic (knock-out) studies indicate that the derived diterpenoid serves as a virulence factor for this rice leaf streak pathogen, serving to reduce the jasmonic acid-mediated defense response. Here the functions of the remaining genes in the Xoc operon are elucidated and the distribution of the operon in X. oryzae is investigated in over 100 isolates. The Xoc operon leads to production of the bioactive GA(4), an additional step beyond production of the penultimate precursor GA(9) mediated by the homologous operons recently characterized from rhizobia. Moreover, this GA biosynthetic operon was found to be widespread in Xoc (> 90%), but absent in the other major X. oryzae pathovar. These results indicate selective pressure for production of GA(4) in the distinct lifestyle of Xoc, and the importance of GA to both fungal and bacterial pathogens of rice.","2017","214","10.1111/nph.14441","me","not yet"

Due to different viticulture measures, distinctly different microbial communities can form, which affects the potentially beneficial interactions with the grapevines. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to identify differences in the community structures of fungal and bacterial soil communities on a landscape scale, and to relate these to the type and duration of soil management, and to within vineyard habitats. Soil fungal and bacterial communities were screened in vineyards with different soil management (ecological, conventional) and ages (3, 10, 35 years). In each vineyard, 35 rhizosphere soil samples were acquired from beneath the grapevines and between the rows, using a grid covering of 240 m(2) per vineyard. Automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis of the microbial soil samples was carried out, with the microbial lifeforms compared among the vineyards (bacteria vs. fungi). There was high variability in the local microbial diversity for all of the sampled plots, with significant differences among the vineyards under ecological and conventional soil management. In comparison to fungi, soil management and age of vineyard had significantly greater impact on bacteria. Microbial communities showed no general overlap in diversity spots or simultaneous changes in community composition along the sampling grids. These results suggest that the microbial communities reflect the influences of highly localised biogeographic factors and vineyard management, with the most profound effects observed after deep tillage. Furthermore, fungal and bacterial communities forming in the vineyard soils appear to be influenced by different sets of environmental factors. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The desiccated mat was sampled in 2010 from an ephemeral rock pool at 5500 m above sea level in the Cordillera Vilcanota of southern PerA. After being frozen for 6 years at -20 A degrees C in the lab, pieces of the mat were sequenced to fully characterize both the 16 and 18S microbial communities and experiments were conducted to determine if organisms in the mat could revive and become active under the extreme freeze-thaw conditions that these mats experience in the field. Sequencing revealed an unexpectedly diverse, multi-trophic microbial community with 16S OTU richness comparable to similar, seasonally desiccated mats from the Dry Valleys of Antarctica and low elevation sites in the Atacama Desert region. The bacterial community of the mat was dominated by phototrophs in the Cyanobacteria (Nostoc) and the Rhodospirillales, whereas the eukaryotic community was dominated by predators such as bdelloid rotifers (Philodinidae). Microcosm experiments showed that bdelloid rotifers in the mat were able to come out of dormancy and actively forage even under realistic field conditions (diurnal temperature fluctuations of -12 A degrees C at night to + 27 A degrees C during the day), and after being frozen for 6 years. Our results broaden our understanding of the diversity of life in periodically desiccated, high-elevation habitats and demonstrate that extreme freeze-thaw cycles per se are not a major factor limiting the development of at least some members of these unique microbial mat systems.","2017","21","10.1007/s00792-017-0926-2","me","not yet"

We selected 529 species to address phylogenetic relationships of higher-level taxa using a maximum-likelihood framework and sequence data from six genes traditionally used in fungal molecular systematics (nrLSU, nrSSU, 5.8S, tef1-alpha, rpb1 and rpb2). These species represent 18 classes, 62 orders, 183 families, and 392 genera from the phyla Basidiomycota (including the newly recognized subphylum Wallemiomycotina) and Entorrhizomycota, and 13 species representing 13 classes of Ascomycota as outgroup taxa. We also conducted a molecular dating analysis based on these six genes for 116 species representing 17 classes and 54 orders of Basidiomycota and Entorrhizomycota. Finally we performed a phyloproteomics analysis from 109 Basidiomycota species and 6 outgroup taxa using amino-acid sequences retrieved from 396 orthologous genes. Recognition of higher taxa follows the criteria in Zhao et al (Fungal Divers 78: 239-292, 2016): (i) taxa must be monophyletic and statistically well-supported in molecular dating analyses, (ii) their respective stem ages should be roughly equivalent, and (iii) stem ages of higher taxa must be older than those of lower level taxa. The time-tree indicates that the mean of stem ages of Basidiomycota and Entorrhizomycota are ca. 530 Ma; subphyla of Basidiomycota are 406-490 Ma; most classes are 358-393 Ma for those of Agaricomycotina and 245-356 Ma for those of Pucciniomycotina and Ustilaginomycotina; most orders of those subphyla split 120-290 Ma. Monophyly of most higher-level taxa of Basidiomycota are generally supported, especially those taxa introduced in the recent ten years: phylum Entorrhizomycota, classes Malasseziomycetes, Moniliel-lomycetes, Spiculogloeomycetes, Tritirachiomycetes and orders Amylocorticiales, Golubeviales, Holtermanniales, Jaapiales, Lepidostromatales, Robbauerales, Stereopsidales and Trichosporonales. However, the younger divergence times of Leucosporidiales (Microbotryomycetes) indicate that its order status is not supported, thus we propose combining it under Microbotryales. On the other hand, the families Buckleyzymaceae and Sakaguchiaceae (Cystoba-sidiomycetes) are raised to Buckleyzymales and Sakaguchiales due to their older divergence times. Cystofilobasidiales (Tremellomycetes) has an older divergence time and should be amended to a higher rank. We however, do not introduce it as new class here for Cystofilobasidiales, as DNA sequences from these taxa are not from their respective types and thus await further studies. Divergence times for Exobasidiomycetes, Cantharellales, Gomphales and Hysterangiales were obtained based on limited species sequences in molecular dating study. More comprehensive phylogenetic studies on those four taxa are needed in the future because our ML analysis based on wider sampling, shows they are not monophyletic groups. In general, the six-gene phylogenies are in agreement with the phyloproteomics tree except for the placements of Wallemiomycotina, orders Amylocorticiales, Auriculariales, Cantharellales, Geastrales, Sebacinales and Trechisporales from Agaricomycetes. These conflicting placements in the six-gene phylogeny vs the phyloproteomics tree are discussed. This leads to future perspectives for assessing gene orthology and problems in deciphering taxon ranks using divergence times.","2017","84","10.1007/s13225-017-0381-5","me","not yet"

Phytoplankton cell size and shape are key traits under selection by environmental filters and species interactions. Spatial differences in resource availability shape species diversity according to their use efficiency. Niche partitioning promotes plankton diversity. Here, we explore how size and shape enter the diversity game. How does taxonomic and morpho-functional community structure vary at different spatial scales? What are the potential drivers shaping the structure of phytoplankton communities? We explore these questions by looking at the individual level variability in taxonomic and morphological traits in a biogeographical snapshot of natural phytoplankton communities in coastal ecosystems around the globe. We found that taxonomic variability is mainly concentrated at local and regional levels, whereas shape and size variability are mainly concentrated at a local level, despite the environmental heterogeneity of ecosystems. Species diversity was more variable than trait diversity from local to global spatial scales. We suggest that structural organization of phytoplankton communities in coastal ecosystems may follow a hierarchical pattern of trait organization, where a different combination of multiple functional traits may represent effective strategies and promote success under given environmental conditions as a resolution of Hutchinsons paradox.","2017","39","10.1093/plankt/fbx001","me","not yet"

The Sarno River, one of the most polluted rivers in Europe, strongly contributes to the pollution of the area, discharging high amounts of heavy metals and organic wastes from heavily cultivated and industrial areas. This paper reports on the diversity and community structure of the marine residential Bacteria and Archaea of the Gulf of Naples in an area close to the river Sarno plume and investigates their small-scale taxonomic diversity and expression patterns as a proxy of potential metabolic activity using metagenomics and metatranscriptomics. Bacteria and Archaea were mainly represented by marine clades, with only minor contributors from freshwater ones. The community was dominated by Alpha- and Gammaproteobacteria, of which Rhodospirillales, Pelagibacteriales, and Oceanospirilalles were most represented. However, Alteromonadales and Rhodobacterales were the most active, despite their relative lower abundance, suggesting that they are important for overall ecosystem functioning and nutrient cycling. Nitrification and a reversed form of dissimilatory sulfate reduction were the major metabolic processes found in the metatrascriptomes and were mainly associated to NitrosopuMilaleS and Pelagibacter, respectively. No clear indication of transcripts related to stress induced by heavy metals or organic pollutants was found. In general, despite the high loads of pollutants discharged continuously by the Sarno River, the microbial community did not show marks of stress-induced changes neither structural nor functional, thus suggesting that this river has little or no effect on the planktonic bacterial community of the Gulf of Naples.

Further, previous studies focused mostly on species richness, while left understudied evenness, another important aspect of biodiversity. Here, we studied the elevational patterns in species richness and evenness of stream biofilm bacteria and diatoms in six mountains in Asia and Europe. We also reviewed published results for elevational richness patterns for soil and stream microbes in a literature analysis. Our results revealed that even within the same ecosystem type (that is, stream) or geographical region, bacteria and diatoms showed contrasting patterns in diversity. Stream microbes, including present stream data, tend to show significantly increasing or decreasing elevational patterns in richness, contrasting the findings for soil microbes that typically showed nonsignificant or significantly decreasing patterns. In all six mountains for bacteria and in four mountains for diatoms, species richness and evenness were positively correlated. The variation in bacteria and diatom richness and evenness were substantially explained by anthropogenic driven factors, such as total phosphorus (TP). However, diatom richness and evenness were also related to different main drivers as richness was mostly related to pH, while evenness was most explained by TP. Our results highlight the lack of consistent elevational biodiversity patterns of microbes and further indicate that the two facets of biodiversity may respond differently to environmental gradients.","2017","40","10.1111/ecog.02216","me","not yet"

Despite substantial environmental differences, bacterial phyla were represented in similar proportions, with Acidobacteria and Proteobacteria the dominant phyla in all forests except one mangrove forest in Sarawak, although highly significant heterogeneity in frequency of individual phyla was detected among forests. In contrast, species diversity (alpha-diversity) differed to a much greater extent, being nearly six-fold higher in the mangrove forest (Chao index = 6,862) than in forests in Singapore and Sarawak (similar to 1,250). In addition, natural mixed dipterocarp forests had lower species diversity than acacia and oil palm plantations, indicating that aboveground tree composition does not influence soil bacterial diversity. Shannon and Chaol indices were correlated positively, implying that skewed operational taxonomic unit (OTU) distribution was associated with the abundance of overall and rare (singleton) OTUs. No OTUs were represented in all 28 forests, and forest -specific OTUs accounted for over 70% of all detected OTUs. Forests that were geographically adjacent and/or of the same forest type had similar bacterial species composition, and a positive correlation was detected between species divergence (beta-diversity) and direct distance between forests. Both alpha- and beta-diversities were correlated with soil pH. These results suggest that soil bacterial communities in different forests evolve largely independently of each other and that soil bacterial communities adapt to their local environment, modulated by bacterial dispersal (distance effect) and forest type. Therefore, we conclude that the biogeography of soil bacteria communities described here is non-random, reflecting the influences of contemporary environmental factors and evolutionary history.","2017","92","10.1266/ggs.16-00013","me","not yet"

First, we measured the weight and maturity of 2,656 T. aestivum fruit bodies from a three-day harvest in August 2014 in a highly productive orchard in Hungary. All specimens ranging between 2 and 755 g were almost evenly distributed through five maturation classes. Then, we measured the weight and maturity of another 4,795 T. aestivum fruit bodies harvested on four occasions between June and October 2015 in the same truffiere. Again, different maturation stages occurred at varying fruit body size and during the entire fruiting season. Finally, the predominantly unrelated weight and maturity of 81 T. aestivum fruit bodies from four fruiting seasons between 2010 and 2013 in Switzerland confirmed the Hungarian results. The spatiotemporal coexistence of 7,532 small-ripe and large-unripe T. aestivum, which accumulate to similar to 182 kg, differs from species-specific associations between the size and ripeness that have been reported for other mushrooms. Although size-independent truffle maturation stages may possibly relate to the perpetual belowground environment, the role of mycelial connectivity, soil property, microclimatology, as well as other abiotic factors and a combination thereof, is still unclear.

They also examined the relative effects of environmental filtering, dispersal limitations and seasonality on community assembly. Their results indicated that (i) in the surface layer, abundant taxa are primarily influenced by dispersal limitations and rare taxa are primarily influenced by environmental filtering, whereas (ii) in the subsurface layer, both abundant and rare sub-communities are only weakly influenced by environmental filtering but are strongly influenced by dispersal limitations. Moreover, (iii) abundant taxa exhibit stronger temporal variability than rare taxa. They also found that abundant and rare sub-communities display similar spatial richness patterns that are negatively correlated with latitude and chlorophyll a and positively correlated with temperature. In summary, environmental filtering and dispersal limitations have different effects on abundant and rare picoeukaryotic sub-communities in different layers. Thus, depth appears as an essential variable that governs the structuring patterns of picoeukaryotic communities in the oceans and should be thoroughly considered to develop a more comprehensive understanding of oceanic microbial assemblages.","2017","19","10.1111/1462-2920.13606","me","not yet"

Environmental conditions strongly shape the metabolic function of microbial communities; however, other processes such as biotic interactions, random demographic drift or dispersal limitation may also influence community dynamics. The relative importance of these processes and their effects on community function remain largely unknown. To address this uncertainty, here we examined bacterial and archaeal communities in replicate miniature aquatic ecosystem s contained within the foliage of wild bromeliads. We used marker gene sequencing to infer the taxonomic composition within nine metabolic functional groups, and shotgun environmental DNA sequencing to estimate the relative abundances of these groups. We found that all of the bromeliads exhibited remarkably similar functional community structures, but that the taxonomic composition within individual functional groups was highly variable. Furthermore, using statistical analyses, we found that non-neutral processes, including environmental filtering and potentially biotic interactions, at least partly shaped the composition within functional groups and were more important than spatial dispersal limitation and demographic drift. Hence both the functional structure and taxonomic composition within functional groups of natural microbial communities may be shaped by non-neutral and roughly separate processes.","2017","1","10.1038/s41559-016-0015","me","not yet"

These interactions provide numerous essential ecosystem services, and the sustainable management of soils has attracted increasing scientific and public attention. Although soil ecology emerged as an independent field of research many decades ago, and we have gained important insights into the functioning of soils, there still are fundamental aspects that need to be better understood to ensure that the ecosystem services that soils provide are not lost and that soils can be used in a sustainable way. In this perspectives paper, we highlight some of the major knowledge gaps that should be prioritized in soil ecological research. These research priorities were compiled based on an online survey of 32 editors of Pedobiologia-Journal of Soil Ecology. These editors work at universities and research centers in Europe, North America, Asia, and Australia. The questions were categorized into four themes: (1) soil biodiversity and biogeography, (2) interactions and the functioning of ecosystems, (3) global change and soil management, and (4) new directions. The respondents identified priorities that may be achievable in the near future, as well as several that are currently achievable but remain open. While some of the identified barriers to progress were technological in nature, many respondents cited a need for substantial leadership and goodwill among members of the soil ecology research community, including the need for multi institutional partnerships, and had substantial concerns regarding the loss of taxonomic expertise.","2017","63","10.1016/j.pedobi.2017.05.003","me","not yet"

Most of the current understanding of these two subgroups is derived from studies in marine environments. In comparison, information on the spatial distribution of these two subgroups in freshwater environments is very limited. The present study analysed the biogeographical pattern of those two groups on a large-river scale (i.e. the Songhua River catchment, >1000 km). The results showed that the concentrations of LNA and HNA bacteria were distributed over a wide range from 5.45 x 10(4) to 4.43 x 10(6) cells mL(-1), and from 1.35 x 10(5) to 4.37 x 10(6) cells mL(-1) respectively. The two groups have almost equal proportions in the Songhua River, with the average contribution of LNA bacteria reaching 47.0%. In comparison, the abundance of LNA bacteria in the mainstream was significantly higher than in the tributaries. The cytometric expressions (green fluorescence and side scatter) within LNA and HNA were strongly covaried, which implies that these two subgroups are intrinsically linked. Multivariate redundancy analysis indicated that both the abundance and cytometric characteristics of co-occurring LNA and HNA bacteria were regulated differently in the Songhua River. This suggests that LNA and HNA bacteria play different ecological roles in river ecosystems.","2017","68","10.1071/MF16068","me","not yet"

We predicted the biogeographic patterns of soil archaeal, bacterial, and fungal communities across 110 natural forest sites along a transect across four vegetation zones in Eastern China. The distance decay relationships demonstrated the distinct biogeographic patterns of archaeal, bacterial, and fungal communities. While historical processes mainly influenced bacterial community variations, spatially autocorrelated environmental variables mainly influenced the fungal community. Archaea did not display a distance decay pattern along the vegetation gradient. Bacterial community diversity and structure were correlated with the ratio of acid oxalate-soluble Fe to free Fe oxides (Feo/Fed ratio). Fungal community diversity and structure were influenced by dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and free aluminum (Ald), respectively. The role of these environmental variables was confirmed by the correlations between dominant operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and edaphic variables. However, most of the dominant OTUs were not correlated with the major driving variables for the entire communities. These results demonstrate that soil archaea, bacteria, and fungi have different biogeographic patterns and driving processes along this continental-scale natural vegetation gradient, implying different community assembly mechanisms and ecological functions for archaea, bacteria, and fungi in soil ecosystems. IMPORTANCE Understanding biogeographic patterns is a precursor to improving our knowledge of the function of microbiomes and to predicting ecosystem responses to environmental change. Using natural forest soil samples from 110 locations, this study is one of the largest attempts to comprehensively understand the different patterns of soil archaeal, bacterial, and fungal biogeography at the continental scale in eastern China. These patterns in natural forest sites could ascertain reliable soil microbial biogeographic patterns by eliminating anthropogenic influences. This information provides guidelines for monitoring the belowground ecosystems decline and restoration. Meanwhile, the deviations in the soil microbial communities from corresponding natural forest states indicate the extent of degradation of the soil ecosystem. Moreover, given the association between vegetation type and the microbial community, this information could be used to predict the long-term response of the underground ecosystem to the vegetation distribution caused by global climate change.","2017","2","10.1128/mSystems.00174-16","me","not yet"

However, historical events, such as past environmental conditions or dispersal events, can be important as well. We provide a short summary of the processes that can lead to so-called legacy effects, where past biotic or abiotic factors influence the composition of present-day communities. Priority effects, which arise if early colonizers gain advantage over later-arriving species, can lead to persistent legacy effects. In contrast, time-lags in environmental selection can lead to transient legacy effects. Dispersal rates as well as factors that influence the adaptability of species to changing environmental conditions should be important factors that determine the relative importance of contemporary selection versus historical processes and whether legacy effects are likely to be permanent or temporary. Working with microbial communities offers the advantage of feasible time series studies and multi-generation experiments, and can therefore make important contributions to a novel systematic framework on how historical processes shape complex metacommunities in nature.","2017","79","10.3354/ame01816","me","not yet"

They are well known to control the distribution of microbial communities in surface waters, although there is scarce information on their role in delimiting critical functions that microbes perform, and on whether their effects can be translated down into the dark ocean. Here we carried out the first study on the variability of hydrolysis of organic matter (extracellular enzymatic activity; FEA) across a permanent front (the Azores Front), coupled with changes in microbial assemblage composition, from the surface down to the bathypelagic zone. The front separated the study area (enclosed into the North Atlantic Subtropical Gyral Province) into two distinct latitudinal sub-regions with sharp differences in the abundance of autotrophic and heterotrophic microbial assemblages, as well as in the extracellular enzymes activities of glucosidases, alkaline phosphatase, and leucine aminopeptidase. South of the front there was an abrupt decline in the abundance of picophytoplankton as well as in heterotrophic prokaryotes with high nucleic-acid content, but an increase in the abundance of prokaryotes with high side-scatter, an indication that cells were growing attached to particles. Concomitantly, there was also an increase in the aminopeptidase to glucosidase ratio, a proxy of higher degradation of proteinaceous material relative to carbohydrates. Interestingly, these sharp changes in microbial assemblages and enzymatic activities north and south of the front were translated down to the deep ocean. Our results suggest that permanent fronts, like the Azores Front, can act as ecological boundaries in the ocean (even within a biogeographical province), in terms of microbial community structure and biogeochemical cycling. Oriented studies on oceanic fronts down to the deep ocean will help to understand how the variability of these widely-extended hydrographic futures will impact microbial communities and carbon cycling in a future ocean affected by trends in global warming, de-oxygenation and acidification.","2017","4","10.3389/fmars.2017.00252","me","not yet"

The potential of microbial communities to access organic matter, and the resultant rates of hydrolysis, affect the efficiency of the biological pump as well as the rate and location of organic carbon cycling in surface and deep waters. In order to investigate spatial- and depth-related patterns in microbial enzymatic capacities in the ocean, we measured hydrolysis rates of six high-molecular-weight polysaccharides and two low-molecular-weight substrate proxies at sites spanning 38 degrees S to 10 degrees N in the Atlantic Ocean, and at six depths ranging from surface to bottom water. In surface to upper mesopelagic waters, the spectrum of substrates hydrolyzed followed distinct patterns, with hydrolytic assemblages more similar vertically within a single station than at similar depths across multiple stations. Additionally, the proportion of total hydrolysis occurring above the pycnocline, and the spectrum of substrates hydrolyzed in mesopelagic and deep waters, was positively related to the strength of stratification at a site, while other physichochemical parameters were generally poor predictors of the measured hydrolysis rates. Spatial as well as depth-driven constraints on heterotrophic hydrolytic capacities result in broad variations in potential carbon-degrading activity in the ocean. The spectrum of enzymatic capabilities and rates of hydrolysis in the ocean, and the proportion of organic carbon hydrolyzed above the permanent thermocline, may influence the efficiency of the biological pump and net carbon export across distinct latitudinal and depth regions.","2017","4","10.3389/fmars.2017.00200","me","not yet"

Using thousands of stochastic individual-based models to simulate energetically constrained life-history processes, we show that our predictions are conceptually sound and mutually compatible and that they support ecological relationships that underpin much of biodiversity theory.

Here we describe an experiment in which the availability of resources to soil bacterial communities was manipulated in a model system, the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica. Mannitol additions were used to simulate a productivity gradient such that a response in bacterial biomass production, taxonomic diversity and functioning (e.g., enzyme activity) were induced. Resource amendment induced a positive linear response in microbial productivity (P < 0.001) but a unimodal (hump-shaped) response in microbial diversity at multiple taxonomic scales (P = 0.035). Putative oligotrophic (e.g., phyla Nitrospirae and Cyanobacteria) and copiotrophic (e.g., phylum Proteobacteria) taxa were apparent through substantial community turnover along the resource gradient. Soil enzyme activity was inversely related to bacterial biomass but positively related to diversity, suggesting the latter may be a stronger control over enzyme-mediated decomposition. The mechanisms behind this pattern are consistent with macroecological theory of a shift from environmental (e.g., stress tolerance) to biotic (e.g., competition) drivers with increasing resource availability. This evidence is among the first of its kind to document a significant unimodal productivity-diversity relationship for soil bacteria.","2019","21","10.1111/1462-2920.14639","me","not yet"

Here, we untangle the complexity of the human microbiome for the Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) that is the most prevalent functional gastrointestinal disorder in human populations. Based on a novel information theoretic network inference model, we detected potential species interaction networks that are functionally and structurally different for healthy and unhealthy individuals. Healthy networks are characterized by a neutral symmetrical pattern of species interactions and scale-free topology versus random unhealthy networks. We detected an inverse scaling relationship between species total outgoing information flow, meaningful of node interactivity, and relative species abundance (RSA). The top ten interacting species are also the least relatively abundant for the healthy microbiome and the most detrimental. These findings support the idea about the diminishing role of network hubs and how these should be defined considering the total outgoing information flow rather than the node degree. Macroecologically, the healthy microbiome is characterized by the highest Pareto total species diversity growth rate, the lowest species turnover, and the smallest variability of RSA for all species. This result challenges current views that posit a universal association between healthy states and the highest absolute species diversity in ecosystems. Additionally, we show how the transitory microbiome is unstable and microbiome criticality is not necessarily at the phase transition between healthy and unhealthy states. We stress the importance of considering portfolios of interacting pairs versus single node dynamics when characterizing the microbiome and of ranking these pairs in terms of their interactions (i.e., species collective behavior) that shape transition from healthy to unhealthy states. The macroecological characterization of the microbiome is useful for public health and disease diagnosis and etiognosis, while species-specific analyses can detect beneficial species leading to personalized design of pre- and probiotic treatments and microbiome engineering.","2019","21","10.3390/e21050506","me","not yet"

It is affected both by geographic and environmental distance between sites. Therefore, analyzing phylogenetic turnover in environmental space requires removing the effect of geographic distance. Here, we apply a novel approach by deciphering phylogenetic turnover of European tetrapods in environmental space after removing geographic land distance effects. We demonstrate that phylogenetic turnover is strongly structured in environmental space, particularly in ectothermic tetrapods, and is well explained by macroecological characteristics such as niche size, species richness and relative phylogenetic diversity. In ectotherms, rather recent evolutionary processes were important in structuring phylogenetic turnover along environmental gradients. In contrast, early evolutionary processes had already shaped the current structure of phylogenetic turnover in endotherms. Our approach enables the disentangling of the idiosyncrasies of evolutionary processes such as the degree of niche conservatism and diversification rates in structuring biodiversity.","2019","10","10.1038/s41467-018-08232-4","me","not yet"
"Early, R; Keith, SA","Geographically variable biotic interactions and implications for species ranges","GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY","The challenge Understanding how biotic interactions affect species geographical ranges, biodiversity patterns and ecological responses to environmental change is one of the most pressing challenges in macroecology. Extensive efforts are underway to detect signals of biotic interactions in macroecological data. However, efforts are limited by bias in the taxa and spatial scale for which occurrence data are available and by difficulty in ascribing causality to co-occurrence patterns. Moreover, we are not necessarily looking in the right places; analyses are largely ad hoc, depending on availability of data, rather than focusing on regions, taxa, ecosystems or interaction types where biotic interactions might affect species geographical ranges most strongly. Unpicking biotic interactions We suggest that macroecology would benefit from the recognition that abiotic conditions alter two key components of biotic interaction strength: frequency and intensity. We outline how and why variation in biotic interaction strength occurs, explore the implications for species geographical ranges and discuss the challenges inherent in quantifying these effects. In addition, we explore the role of behavioural flexibility in mediating biotic interactions potentially to mitigate impacts of environmental change. New data We argue that macroecology should take advantage of independent data on the strength of biotic interactions measured by other disciplines, in order to capture a far wider array of taxa, locations and interaction types than are typically studied in macroecology. Data on biotic interactions are readily available from community, disease, microbial and parasite ecology, evolution, palaeontology, invasion biology and agriculture, but most are yet to be exploited within macroecology. Integrating biotic interaction strength data into macroecology Harmonization of data across interdisciplinary sources, taxa and interaction types could be achieved by breaking down interactions into elements that contribute to frequency and intensity. This would allow quantitative biotic interaction data to be incorporated directly into models of species distributions and macroecological patterns.","2019","28","10.1111/geb.12861","me","not yet"

Based primarily on laboratory experiments, PUAs have been implicated in deleterious effects on herbivores and competing phytoplankton species or in the regulation of the rates of bacterial organic matter remineralization; however, the role of the PUAs at an ecosystem level is still under discussion. Using data of PUA production in natural phytoplankton assemblages over a wide range of conditions, we analyzed macroecological patterns aiming for a comprehensive environmental contextualization that will further our understanding of the control and ecologic role played by these compounds. PUA composition changed from the predominance of decadienal in oligotrophy, octadienal in eutrophy, and heptadienal at intermediate conditions. The production of PUAs per unit biomass also showed a strong relationship with the trophic status, sharply increasing towards oligotrophic conditions and with small-sized cells reaching the highest production rates. High ratios of dissolved inorganic nitrogen to dissolved inorganic phosphorus also promoted PUA production, albeit to a considerably lesser extent. Although the allelopathic use of PUAs to outcompete other phytoplankton or reduce herbivory may be key in some environments and interactions, the macroecological patterns found here, showing higher production towards the poorest waters and among the small species typically populating these environments, support and link at the large scale the hypotheses of the nutrient-derived stress as driver for the production of PUAs together with the use of these compounds as boosters for the nutrient remineralization.","2018","8","10.1038/s41598-018-29787-8","me","not yet"
"Knight, TM; Ashman, TL; Bennett, JM; Burns, JH; Passonneau, S; Steets, JA","Reflections on, and visions for, the changing field of pollination ecology","ECOLOGY LETTERS","Since the launch of Ecology Letters in 1998, the field of Pollination Ecology has changed considerably in its focus. In this review, we discuss the major discoveries across the past two decades. We quantitatively synthesise the frequency by which different concepts and topics appeared in the peer-reviewed literature, as well as the connections between these topics. We then look forward to identify pressing research frontiers and opportunities for additional integration in the future. We find that there has been a shift towards viewing plant-pollinator interactions as networks and towards understanding how global drivers influence the plants, pollinators and the ecosystem service of pollination. Future frontiers include moving towards a macroecological view of plant-pollinator interactions, understanding how ecological intensification and urbanisation will influence pollination, considering other interactions, such as plant-microbe-pollinator networks, and understanding the causes and consequences of extinctions. Pollination Ecology is poised to advance our basic understanding of the ecological and evolutionary factors that shape plant-animal interactions and to create applied knowledge that informs conservation decision making.","2018","21","10.1111/ele.13094","me","not yet"
"Finotello, F; Mastrorilli, E; Di Camillo, B","Measuring the diversity of the human microbiota with targeted next-generation sequencing","BRIEFINGS IN BIOINFORMATICS","The human microbiota is a complex ecological community of commensal, symbiotic and pathogenic microorganisms harboured by the human body. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, in particular targeted amplicon sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene (16S-seq), are enabling the identification and quantification of human-resident microorganisms at unprecedented resolution, providing novel insights into the role of the microbiota in health and disease. Once microbial abundances are quantified through NGS data analysis, diversity indices provide valuable mathematical tools to describe the ecological complexity of a single sample or to detect species differences between samples. However, diversity is not a determined physical quantity for which a consensus definition and unit of measure have been established, and several diversity indices are currently available. Furthermore, they were originally developed for macroecology and their robustness to the possible bias introduced by sequencing has not been characterized so far. To assist the reader with the selection and interpretation of diversity measures, we review a panel of broadly used indices, describing their mathematical formulations, purposes and properties, and characterize their behaviour and criticalities in dependence of the data features using simulated data as ground truth. In addition, we make available an R package, DiversitySeq, which implements in a unified framework the full panel of diversity indices and a simulator of 16S-seq data, and thus represents a valuable resource for the analysis of diversity from NGS count data and for the benchmarking of computational methods for 16S-seq.","2018","19","10.1093/bib/bbw119","me","not yet"
"Wilcox, JJS; Hollocher, H","Unprecedented Symbiont Eukaryote Diversity Is Governed by Internal Trophic Webs in a Wild Non-Human Primate","PROTIST","Research on host-associated microbiomes has highlighted major divisions between the role of eukaryotes in free-living and symbiont systems. These trends call into question the relevance of macroecological processes to host-associated systems and the relative importance of parasitism, commensalism, and mutualism as evolutionary patterns across the domains of life. However, it is unclear as to whether these apparent differences reflect biological realities or methodologies in community characterization: free-living eukaryotes tend to be characterized using metabarcoding whereas symbiont eukaryotes are typically characterized with microscopy. Here, we utilize an Illumina high-throughput metabarcoding approach to characterize the diversity and dynamics of eukaryotic symbiont communities in the feces of a wild non-human primate, Macaca fascicularis, revealing functionally and taxonomically diverse communities of eukaryotes hitherto unreported from any vertebrate. Importantly, community assembly was consistent with top-down and bottom-up trophic food web dynamics, high-lighting the applicability of macroecological principles to these communities. Ultimately, our findings highlight vertebrate-associated symbiont communities of the gut that are much more similar to free-living systems than previously realized. Additionally, our results support a role for symbiosis as a major recurrent life strategy among eukaryotes and highlight the potential for vertebrates to host vast reservoirs of unexplored eukaryotic diversity.

Accumulating evidence suggests that aside from this direct role, other infectious agents may also indirectly affect cancer epidemiology through interactions with the oncogenic agents within the wider infection community. Here, we address this hypothesis via analysis of large-scale global data to identify associations between human cancer incidence and assemblages of neglected infectious agents. We focus on a gradient of three widely-distributed cancers with an infectious cause: bladder (similar to 2% of recorded cancer cases are due to Shistosoma haematobium), liver (similar to 60% consecutive to Hepatitis B and C infection) and stomach (Helicobacter pylori is associated with similar to 70% of cases). We analyzed countries in tropical and temperate regions separately, and controlled for many confounding social and economic variables. First, we found that particular assemblages of bacteria are associated with bladder cancer incidences. Second, we observed a specific and robust association between helminths and liver cancer incidences in both biomes. Third, we show that certain assemblages of viruses may facilitate stomach cancer in tropical area, while others protect against its development in temperate countries. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results in terms of cancer prevention and highlight the necessity to consider neglected diseases, especially in tropics, to adapt public health strategies against infectious diseases and cancer.","2018","61","10.1016/j.meegid.2018.03.016","me","not yet"

Few facets of biology vary more than functional traits and life-history traits. To explore this vast variation, functional ecologists and population ecologists have developed independent approaches that identify the mechanisms behind and consequences of trait variation. 2. Collaborative research between researchers using trait-based and demographic approaches remains scarce. We argue that this is a missed opportunity, as the strengths of both approaches could help boost the research agendas of functional ecology and population ecology. 3. This special feature, which spans three journals of the British Ecological Society due to its interdisciplinary nature, showcases state-of-the-art research applying trait-based and demographic approaches to examine relationships between organismal function, life history strategies and population performance across multiple kingdoms. Examples include the exploration of how functional trait x environment interactions affect vital rates and thus explain population trends and species occurrence; the coordination of seed traits and dispersal ability with the pace of life in plants; the incorporation of functional traits in dynamic energy budget models; or the discovery of linkages between microbial functional traits and the fast-slow continuum. 4. Despite their historical isolation, collaborative work between functional ecologists and population ecologists could unlock novel research pathways. We call for an integrative research agenda to evaluate which and when traits are functional, as well as their ability to describe and predict life history strategies and population dynamics. We highlight promising, complementary research avenues to overcome current limitations. These include a more explicit linkage of selection gradients in the context of functional trait-vital rate relationships, and the implementation of standardised protocols to track changes in traits and vital rates over time at the same location and individuals, thus allowing for the explicit incorporation of trade-offs in analyses of covariation of functional traits and life-history traits.","2018","32","10.1111/1365-2435.13148","me","not yet"
"Polishchuk, LV","MS Ghilarovs Principle, or biomass equivalence rule, as one of conservation laws in ecology","ZHURNAL OBSHCHEI BIOLOGII","It may seem surprising that in ecology as in physics there are conservation laws, though these laws are less accurate than in physics and hold only on average, that is, on large spatial scales (macroecology). One of such laws is a biomass equivalence rule, which was proposed by Sheldon and later confirmed by Tseitlin and others. According to the rule, in equal intervals of the logarithm of body size, spanning the range from bacteria to whales, the biomass of marine pelagic organisms remains approximately equal. However, as noted by Tseitlin long before Sheldon et al.s work, a similar regularity was discovered by M.S. Ghilarov for soil organisms. In his 1944 paper, M.S. Ghilarov unequivocally wrote: The biomass of soil organisms of different natural body-size groups is approximately of the same order of magnitude: the product of the number of organisms belonging to a given size group times their linear size cubed varies very little. Here, I show that M.S. Ghilarovs natural body-size groups, in the range from bacteria to myriapods and insects, occupy approximately equal size intervals on a logarithmic scale. It turns out that for both soil and pelagial, equal logarithmic intervals of body size contain approximately equal biomasses. The priority of the discovery of this rule belongs to M.S. Ghilarov. After Tseitlin, I propose to call it the M.S. Ghilarov principle. Furthermore, I suggest that the M.S. Ghilarov principle holds not only for soil and pelagic organisms but also for other organisms inhabiting sufficiently homogeneous and extended habitats.","2018","79","10.7868/S0044459618030028","me","not yet"

Here, we take a macroecological approach to investigate factors influencing why some parasites show a tendency to infect species widely distributed in the host phylogeny (phylogenetic generalism) while others infect only closely related hosts. Using a database on over 1400 parasite species that have been documented to infect up to 69 terrestrial mammal host species, we characterize the phylogenetic generalism of parasites using standard effect sizes for three metrics: mean pairwise phylogenetic distance (PD), maximum PD and phylogenetic aggregation. We identify a trend towards phylogenetic specialism, though statistically host relatedness is most often equivalent to that expected from a random sample of host species. Bacteria and arthropod parasites are typically the most generalist, viruses and helminths exhibit intermediate generalism, and protozoa are on average the most specialist. While viruses and helminths have similar mean pairwise PD on average, the viruses exhibit higher variation as a group. Close-contact transmission is the transmission mode most associated with specialism. Most parasites exhibiting phylogenetic aggregation (associating with discrete groups of species dispersed across the host phylogeny) are helminths and viruses.","2018","285","10.1098/rspb.2017.2613","me","not yet"

After many years of lagging behind due to the difficulty of assigning both taxonomy and function to poorly distinguishable microscopic cells, microbial ecology now has access to a suite of powerful molecular tools which allow its practitioners to generate data relating to diversity and function of a microbial community on an unprecedented scale. Instead, the problem facing todays microbial ecologists is coupling the ease of generation of these datasets with the formulation and testing of workable hypotheses relating the diversity and function of environmental, host-associated, and engineered microbial communities. Here, we review the current state of knowledge regarding the links between taxonomic alpha-and beta-diversity and ecosystem function, comparing our knowledge in this area to that obtained by macroecologists who use more traditional techniques. We consider the methodologies that can be applied to study these properties and how successful they are at linking function to diversity, using examples from the study of model microbial ecosystems, methanogenic bioreactors (anaerobic digesters), and host-associated microbiota. Finally, we assess ways in which our newly acquired understanding might be used to manipulate diversity in ecosystems of interest in order to improve function for the benefit of us or the environment in general through the provision of ecosystem services.","2018","105","10.1016/bs.aambs.2018.07.002","me","not yet"
"Soininen, J; Heino, J; Wang, JJ","A meta-analysis of nestedness and turnover components of beta diversity across organisms and ecosystems","GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY","Aim: The number of studies investigating the nestedness and turnover components of beta diversity has increased substantially, but our general understanding of the drivers of turnover and nestedness remains elusive. Here, we examined the effects of species traits, spatial extent, latitude and ecosystem type on the nestedness and turnover components of beta diversity. Location: Global. Time period: 1968-2017. Major taxa studied: From bacteria to mammals. Methods: From the 99 studies that partition total beta diversity into its turnover and nestedness components, we assembled 269 and 259 data points for the pairwise and multiple site beta-diversity metrics, respectively. Our data covered a broad variation in species dispersal type, body size and trophic position. The data were from freshwater, marine and terrestrial realms, and encompassed geographical areas from the tropics to near polar regions. We used linear modelling as a meta-regression tool to analyse the data. Results: Pairwise turnover, multiple site turnover and total beta diversity all decreased significantly with latitude. In contrast, multiple site nestedness showed a positive relationship with latitude. Beta-diversity components did not generally differ among the realms. The turnover component and total beta diversity increased with spatial extent, whereas nestedness was scale invariant for pairwise metrics. Multiple site beta-diversity components did not vary with spatial extent. Surprisingly, passively dispersed organisms had lower turnover and total beta diversity than flying organisms. Body size showed a relatively weak relationship with beta diversity but had important interactions with trophic position, thus also affecting beta diversity via interactive effects. Producers had significantly higher average pairwise turnover and total beta diversity than carnivores. Main conclusions: The present results provide evidence that species turnover, being consistently the larger component of total beta diversity, and nestedness are related to the latitude of the study area and intrinsic organismal features. We showed that two beta-diversity components had generally opposing patterns with regard to latitude. We highlight that beta-diversity partition may give additional insights into the underlying causes of spatial variability in biotic communities compared with total beta diversity alone.","2018","27","10.1111/geb.12660","me","not yet"
"Zhou, ZH; Wang, CK; Luo, YQ","Effects of forest degradation on microbial communities and soil carbon cycling: A global meta-analysis","GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY","Aim: The aim was to explore how conversions of primary or secondary forests to plantations or agricultural systems influence soil microbial communities and soil carbon (C) cycling. Location: Global. Time period: 1993-2017. Major taxa studied: Soil microbes. Methods: A meta-analysis was conducted to examine effects of forest degradation on soil properties and microbial attributes related to microbial biomass, activity, community composition and diversity based on 408 cases from 119 studies in the world. Results: Forest degradation decreased the ratios of K-strategists to r-strategists (i.e., ratios of fungi to bacteria, Acidobacteria to Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria to Bacteroidetes and Acidobacteria+Actinobacteria to Proteobacteria+Bacteroidetes). The response ratios (RRs) of the K-strategist to r-strategist ratios to forest degradation decreased and increased with increased RRs of soil pH and soil C to nitrogen ratio (C:N), respectively. Forest degradation increased the bacterial alpha-diversity indexes, of which the RRs increased and decreased as the RRs of soil pH and soil C: N increased, respectively. The overall RRs across all the forest degradation types ranked as microbial C (-40.4%)> soil C (-33.3%)> microbial respiration (-18.9%)> microbial C to soil C ratio (qMBC; -15.9%), leading to the RRs of microbial respiration rate per unit microbial C (qCO(2)) and soil C decomposition rate (respiration rate per unit soil C), on average, increasing by +43.2 and +25.0%, respectively. Variances of the RRs of qMBC and qCO(2) were significantly explained by the soil C, soil C: N and mean annual precipitation. Main conclusions: Forest degradation consistently shifted soil microbial community compositions from K-strategist dominated to r-strategist dominated, altered soil properties and stimulated microbial activity and soil C decomposition. These results are important for modelling the soil C cycling under projected global land-use changes and provide supportive evidence for applying the macroecology theory on ecosystem succession and disturbance in soil microbial ecology.","2018","27","10.1111/geb.12663","me","not yet"

In order to probe, monitor, and eventually control these communities, fast detection and evaluation methods are required. In order to facilitate rapid community analysis and monitor a communitys dynamic behavior with high resolution, we here apply community flow cytometry, which provides single-cell-based high-dimensional data characterizing communities with high acuity over time. To interpret time series data, we draw inspiration from macroecology, in which a rich set of concepts has been developed for describing population dynamics. We focus on the stability paradigm as a promising candidate to interpret such data in an intuitive and actionable way and present a rapid workflow to monitor stability properties of complex microbial ecosystems. Based on single-cell data, we compute the stability properties resistance, resilience, displacement speed, and elasticity. For resilience, we also introduce a method which can be implemented for continuous online community monitoring. The proposed workflow was tested in a long-term continuous reactor experiment employing both an artificial and a complex microbial community, which were exposed to identical short-term disturbances. The computed stability properties uncovered the superior stability of the complex community and demonstrated the global applicability of the protocol to any microbiome. The workflow is able to support high temporal sample densities below bacterial generation times. This may provide new opportunities to unravel unknown ecological paradigms of natural microbial communities, with applications to environmental, biotechnological, and health-related microbiomes. IMPORTANCE Microbial communities drive many processes which affect human well-being directly, as in the human microbiome, or indirectly, as in natural environments or in biotechnological applications. Due to their complexity, their dynamics over time is difficult to monitor, and current sequence-based approaches are limited with respect to the temporal resolution. However, in order to eventually control microbial community dynamics, monitoring schemes of high temporal resolution are required. Flow cytometry provides single-cell-based data in the required temporal resolution, and we here use such data to compute stability properties as easy to interpret univariate indicators of microbial community dynamics. Such monitoring tools will allow for a fast, continuous, and cost-effective screening of stability states of microbiomes. Applicable to various environments, including bioreactors, surface water, and the human body, it will contribute to the development of control schemes to manipulate microbial community structures and performances.","2018","3","10.1128/mSphere.00564-17","me","not yet"
"Ryo, M; Rillig, MC","Statistically reinforced machine learning for nonlinear patterns and variable interactions","ECOSPHERE","Most statistical models assume linearity and few variable interactions, even though real-world ecological patterns often result from nonlinear and highly interactive processes. We here introduce a set of novel empirical modeling techniques which can address this mismatch: statistically reinforced machine learning. We demonstrate the behaviors of three techniques (conditional inference tree, model-based tree, and permutation-based random forest) by analyzing an artificially generated example dataset that contains patterns based on nonlinearity and variable interactions. The results show the potential of statistically reinforced machine learning algorithms to detect nonlinear relationships and higher-order interactions. Estimation reliability for any technique, however, depended on sample size. The applications of statistically reinforced machine learning approaches would be particularly beneficial for investigating (1) novel patterns for which shapes cannot be assumed a priori, (2) higher-order interactions which are often overlooked in parametric statistics, (3) context dependency where patterns change depending on other conditions, (4) significance and effect sizes of variables while taking nonlinearity and variable interactions into account, and (5) a hypothesis using parametric statistics after identifying patterns using statistically reinforced machine learning techniques.","2017","8","10.1002/ecs2.1976","me","not yet"

Empirical evidence exists of power laws associated with the number of species inhabiting an ecosystem, their abundances, and traits. Although their functional form appears to be ubiquitous, empirical scaling exponents vary with ecosystem type and resource supply rate. The idea that ecological scaling laws are linked has been entertained before, but the full extent of macroecological pattern covariations, the role of the constraints imposed by finite resource supply, and a comprehensive empirical verification are still unexplored. Here, we propose a theoretical scaling framework that predicts the linkages of several macroecological patterns related to species abundances and body sizes. We show that such a framework is consistent with the stationary-state statistics of a broad class of resource-limited community dynamics models, regardless of parameterization and model assumptions. We verify predicted theoretical covariations by contrasting empirical data and provide testable hypotheses for yet unexplored patterns. We thus place the observed variability of ecological scaling exponents into a coherent statistical framework where patterns in ecology embed constrained fluctuations.","2017","114","10.1073/pnas.1708376114","me","not yet"

Here we modelled the global diversity of symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi using currently available data on AM fungal molecular diversity (small subunit (SSU) ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequences) in field samples. To differentiate between regional and local effects, we estimated species pools (sets of potentially suitable taxa) for each site, which are expected to reflect regional processes. We then calculated community completeness, an index showing the fraction of the species pool present, which is expected to reflect local processes. We found significant spatial variation, globally in species pool size, as well as in local and dark diversity (absent members of the species pool). Species pool size was larger close to areas containing tropical grasslands during the last glacial maximum, which are possible centres of diversification. Community completeness was greater in regions of high wilderness (remoteness from human disturbance). Local diversity was correlated with wilderness and current connectivity to mountain grasslands. Applying the species pool concept to symbiotic fungi facilitated a better understanding of how biodiversity can be jointly shaped by large-scale historical processes and recent human disturbance.","2017","216","10.1111/nph.14695","me","not yet"

We simultaneously tested three groups of variables (propagule pressure, abiotic and biotic characteristics), selected as putative predictors of invasibility of a site. Propagule pressure, expressed as proximity to larger inhabited areas, and differences in the native species richness of the receiving community, had a significant role in determining the number of alien species occurrences.

The current study assessed the diversity of aquatic fungi, by the traditional approach based on conidial morphology (captures reproducing aquatic hyphomycetes) and next generation sequencing (NGS; captures other fungi as well), on graded sizes of alder leaves (0.6 to 13.6 cm(2)). Leaves were submerged in two streams in geographically distant locations: the Oliveira Stream in Portugal and the Boss Brook in Canada. Decay rates of alder leaves and fungal sporulation rates did not differ between streams. Fungal biomass was higher in Boss Brook than in Oliveira Stream, and in both streams almost 100% of the reads belonged to active fungal taxa. In general, larger leaf areas tended to harbour more fungi, but these findings were not consistent between techniques. Morphospecies-based diversity increased with leaf area in Boss Brook, but not in Oliveira Stream; metabarcoding data showed an opposite trend. The higher resolution of metabarcoding resulted in steeper taxa-accumulation curves than morphospecies-based assessments (fungal conidia morphology). Fungal communities assessed by metabarcoding were spatially structured by leaf area in both streams. Metabarcoding promises greater resolution to assess biodiversity patterns in aquatic fungi and may be more accurate for assessing taxa-area relationships and local to global diversity ratios.","2017","12","10.1371/journal.pone.0181545","me","not yet"

Using a global scale compilation of >20,000 samples from environmental, engineered and host-related ecosystems, we test the power of competing theories to predict distributions of microbial abundance and diversity-abundance scaling laws. We show that these patterns are best explained by the synergistic interaction of stochastic processes that are captured by lognormal dynamics. We demonstrate that lognormal dynamics have predictive power across scales of abundance, a criterion that is essential to biodiversity theory.

However, studies supporting this microbial seed bank hypothesis have analyzed taxonomic marker genes rather than whole genomes/metagenomes, leaving open the possibility that disparate ocean regions harbor endemic gene content. The Red Sea is isolated geographically from the rest of the ocean and has a combination of high irradiance, high temperature, and high salinity that is unique among the oceans; we therefore asked whether it harbors endemic gene content. We sequenced and assembled single-cell genomes of 21 SAR11 (subclades Ia, Ib, Id, and II) and 5 Prochlorococcus (ecotype HLII) samples from the Red Sea and combined them with globally sourced reference genomes to cluster genes into ortholog groups (OGs). Ordination of OG composition could distinguish clades, including phylogenetically cryptic Prochlorococcus ecotypes LLII and LLIII. Compared with reference genomes, 1% of Prochlorococcus and 17% of SAR11 OGs were unique to the Red Sea genomes (RS-OGs). Most (83%) RS-OGs had no annotated function, but 65% of RS-OGs were expressed in diel Red Sea metatranscriptomes, suggesting they are functional. Searching Tara Oceans metagenomes, RS-OGs were as likely to be found as non-RS-OGs; nevertheless, Red Sea and other warm samples could be distinguished from cooler samples using the relative abundances of OGs. The results suggest that the prevalence of OGs in these surface ocean bacteria is largely cosmopolitan, with differences in population metagenomes manifested by differences in relative abundance rather than complete presence/absence of OGs. IMPORTANCE Studies have shown that as we sequence seawater from a selected environment deeper and deeper, we approach finding every bacterial taxon known for the ocean as a whole. However, such studies have focused on taxonomic marker genes rather than on whole genomes, raising the possibility that the lack of endemism results from the method of investigation. We took a geographically isolated water body, the Red Sea, and sequenced single cells from it. We compared those single-cell genomes to available genomes from around the ocean and to ocean-spanning metagenomes. We showed that gene ortholog groups found in Red Sea genomes but not in other genomes are nevertheless common across global ocean metagenomes. These results suggest that Baas Beckings hypothesis everything is everywhere, but the environment selects also applies to gene ortholog groups. This widely dispersed functional diversity may give oceanic microbial communities the functional capacity to respond rapidly to changing conditions.","2019","85","10.1128/AEM.00369-19","me","not yet"

Storm-tracking, furthermore, can be used as a valuable environmental indicator to trace down what factors are influencing bioaerosols. We estimate annual aeolian snowfall deposits of up to similar to 10 kg of bacterial/archaeal biomass per hectare along our study area of the eastern Front Range in Colorado. The dominant kinds of microbiota captured in an analysis of seven snow events at two different locations, one urban, one rural, across the winter of 2016/2017 included phyla Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Acidobacteria, though a multitude of different kinds of organisms were found in both. Taxonomically, Bacteroidetes were more abundant in Golden (urban plain) snow while Proteobacteria were more common in Sunshine (rural mountain) samples. Chemically, Golden snowfall was positively correlated with some metals and anions. The work also hints at better informing the everything is everywhere hypotheses of the microbial world and that atmospheric transport of microbiota is not only common, but is capable of disseminating vast amounts of microbiota of different physiologies and genetics that then affect ecosystems globally. Snowfall, we conclude, is a significant repository of microbiological material with strong implications for both ecosystem genetic flux and general bio-aerosol theory.","2018","6","10.7717/peerj.5961","me","not yet"

However, less is known about the role of soil depth in fungal community assemblages, especially under soil environments that are intensely cold, infertile and water deficient In Ngari drylands of the Asiatic Plateau, we studied fungal assemblages at two soil depths, using Illumina sequencing of the ITS2 region for fungal identification (0-15 cm as the surface soil and 15 -30 cm as the subsurface soil). Fungal diversity in the surface soil was much higher than that in the subsurface soil (P < 0.001), and communities differed significantly between the two layers (P = 0.001). Neither soil properties nor dispersal limitation could explain variation in the surface-soil fungal community. For the subsurface, by contrast, soil, climate and space explained 27% of variation in fungal community. Collectively, these results point to high dispersal rates and absence of edaphic effects in the surface-soil fungal community assemblage in Ngari drylands. It also suggests that for soil fungi with highly effective dispersal, regional distributions may fit with Bass-Beckings paradigm that Everything is everywhere. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

However, this is a hypothesis that has not been extensively evaluated. This study evaluated the fundamental prediction contained in this hypothesis-in the sense that species are structured in the landscape according to their local habitats-, using as study model the phylogenetic diversity of the culturable bacteria of Fildes Peninsula (King George Island, Antarctica). Eighty bacterial strains isolated from 10 different locations in the area, were recovered. Based on phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences, the isolates were grouped into twenty-six phylotypes distributed in three main clades, of which only six are exclusive to Antarctica. Results showed that phylotypes do not group significantly by habitat type; however, local habitat types had phylogenetic signal, which support the phylogenetic niche conservatism hypothesis and not a selective role of the environment like the Baas-Becking hypothesis suggests. We propose that, more than habitat selection resulting in new local adaptations and diversity, local historical colonization and species sorting (i.e. differences in speciation and extinction rates that arise by interaction of species level traits with the environment) play a fundamental role on the culturable bacterial diversity in Antarctica.","2017","12","10.1371/journal.pone.0179390","me","not yet"

However, the relative importance of these processes is still debated. Microbial communities of flowers, in particular, have gained recent attention because of their potential impact to plant fitness and plant-pollinator interactions. However, the role of selection and dispersal in the assembly of these communities remains poorly understood. Here, we evaluated the role of pollinator-mediated dispersal on the contribution of neutral and selective processes in the assembly of floral microbiomes of the yellow monkeyflower (Mimulus guttatus). We sampled floral organs from flowers in the presence and absence of pollinators within five different serpentine seeps in CA and obtained 16S amplicon data on the epiphytic bacterial communities. Consistent with strong microenvironment selection within flowers we observed significant differences in community composition across floral organs and only a small effect of geographic distance. Pollinator exposure affected the contribution of environmental selection and depended on the rate and intimacy of interactions with flower visitors. This study provides evidence of the importance of dispersal and within-flower heterogeneity in shaping epiphytic bacterial communities of flowers, and highlights the complex interplay between pollinator behaviour, environmental selection and additional abiotic factors in shaping the epiphytic bacterial communities of flowers.","2019","28","10.1111/mec.15280","me","not yet"

We selected three typical paddy soils in three regions from north to south in China to investigate the vertical distribution (0-100 cm) of the bacterial community by Illumina MiSeq amplicon sequencing and identify its drivers. Results indicated that the dominant bacterial phyla in paddy soils were Chloroflexi, Acidobacteria, and Proteobacteria. The four diversity indices of the bacterial community all increased at depths of 0-20 cm, then gradually decreased at depths of 20-100 cm. Linear discriminant analysis effect size showed that some bacterial taxa displayed significant differences in relative abundance among different depth gradients. Some bacterial taxa (such as phyla Chloroflexi, Bacteroidetes, and Nitrospirae; classes Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, and Anaerolineae; and genera Candidatus Koribacter and Rhodoplanes) had a high relative abundance at depths of 0-20 cm. Other taxa (belonging to classes Deltaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria and to genera Geobacter and Acinetobacter) had a high relative abundance at depths of 80-100 cm. Non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis indicated that the soil bacterial community structure clearly changed with region and soil depth, and the shifts in bacterial community composition increased with depth in three paddy soils. Variance partitioning analysis showed that geographic distance had more effect on bacterial community distribution than environmental variables in deeper soil (20-100 cm) at a large scale. In addition, distance-based redundancy analysis suggested that soil total carbon and nitrogen contents were strongly associated with the vertical distribution of the bacterial community in paddy soil.","2019","77","10.1016/j.pedobi.2019.150589","me","not yet"

The composition of foliar fungal communities is variable at spatial scales both small (e.g. individual plants) and large (e.g. continents), yet few studies have attempted to tease apart spatial from climatic factors influencing these communities. Moreover, few studies have sampled in more than 1 year to gauge interannual variation in community structure. Location The Pacific Northwest of western North America. Taxon Foliar fungi associated with the deciduous tree Populus trichocarpa. Methods In two consecutive years, we used DNA metabarcoding to characterize foliar fungal communities of Populus trichocarpa across its geographic range, which encompasses a sharp climatic transition as it crosses the Cascade Mountain Range. We used multivariate analyses to (a) test for and differentiate spatial and environmental factors affecting community composition and (b) test for temporal variation in community composition across spatial and environmental gradients. Results In both study years, we found that foliar fungal community composition varied among sites and between regions (east vs. west of the Cascades). We found that climate explained more variation in community composition than geographic distance, although the majority of variation explained by each was shared. We also found that interannual variation in community composition depended on environmental context: communities located in the dry, eastern portion of the trees geographic range varied more between study years than those located in the wet, western portion of the trees range. Main conclusions Our results suggest that the environment plays a greater role in structuring foliar fungal communities than dispersal limitation.","2019","46","10.1111/jbi.13641","me","not yet"

Here we describe the diversity of microbial communities from ice and periglacial soils from near the summit of Mt. Kilimanjaro by using both Illumina and Sanger sequencing of 16S and 18S rRNA genes. Ice and periglacial soils contain unexpectedly diverse and rich assemblages of Bacteria and Eukarya indicating that there may be high rates of dispersal to the top of this tropical mountain and/or that the habitat is more conducive to microbial life than was previously thought. Most bacterial OTUs are cosmopolitan and an analysis of isolation by geographic distance patterns of the genus Polaromonas emphasized the importance of global Aeolian transport in the assembly of bacterial communities on Kilimanjaro. The eukaryotic communities were less diverse than the bacterial communities and showed more evidence of dispersal limitations and apparent endemism. Cercozoa dominated the 18S communities, including a high abundance of testate amoebae and a high diversity of endemic OT Us within the Vampyrellida. These results argue for more intense study of this unique high-elevation island of the cryosphere before the glaciers of Kilimanjaro disappear forever.","2019","9","10.1038/s41598-019-46521-0","me","not yet"

Fungi constitute an important component of soil microorganism communities. They play an important role in biodiversity maintenance, community assembly, and ecosystem functioning, and differ from many macroorganisms in many traits. Here, we examined soil fungal communities in Chinese temperate, subtropical, and tropic forests using Illumina MiSeq sequencing of the fungal ITS1 region. The relative effect of late Quaternary climate change and contemporary environment (plant, soil, current climate, and geographic distance) on the soil fungal community was analyzed. The richness of the total fungal community, along with saprotrophic, ectomycorrhizal (EM), and pathogenic fungal communities, was influenced primarily by the contemporary environment (plant and/or soil) but not by late Quaternary climate change. Late Quaternary climate change acted in concert with the contemporary environment to shape total, saprotrophic, EM, and pathogenic fungal community compositions and with a stronger effect in temperate forest than in tropic-subtropical forest ecosystems. Some contemporary environmental factors influencing total, saprotrophic, EM, and pathogenic fungal communities in temperate and tropic-subtropical forests were different. We demonstrate that late Quaternary climate change can help to explain current soil fungal community composition and argue that climatic legacies can help to predict soil fungal responses to climate change.","2019","9","10.1002/ece3.5247","me","not yet"

In this study, substrates with different pH levels (5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, and 8.0) were set up to elucidate the effect of pH on cadmium (Cd) uptake in grafted muskmelon (Cucumis melo L.) plants. Bacterial diversity was also investigated. Results showed that pH and high Cd concentration greatly affected the growth of grafted plants. The chlorophyll content of the muskmelon leaves decreased at 100 mu M Cd. The majority of the Cd ions accumulated in the rootstock rather than in the shoot tissue in all of the treatments. The shoots and roots showed the highest Cd content at pH 5.5 and the lowest Cd content at pH 8.0 regardless of the Cd concentration. The operational taxonomic units belonging to Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes were significantly (p < 0.05) enriched at different substrate pH levels compared with those at pH 5.0. The operational taxonomic units belonging to the phyla Firmicutes, Acidobacteria, and Chloroflexi were significantly decreased The available nitrogen, phosphorus, Cd, and pH were strongly linked to bacterial community compositions. On the contrary, the available potassium was weakly correlated with the bacterial structure. This study demonstrates that pH greatly affects Cd uptake in grafted muskmelon plants and predicts microbial community structures in breeding substrates with different pH levels. Our results suggest that Cd accumulation in grafted plants can be reduced by setting the appropriate substrate pH. This work can serve as a reference for growing high-quality grafted plants and ensuring food safety in the presence of Cd contamination.","2019","139","10.1016/j.plaphy.2019.03.013","me","not yet"

Here, we used 165 rDNA sequence data from lake sediments to test for community assembly patterns in cyanobacterial phylogenies across ten European peri-Alpine lakes and over a century of eutrophication and climate warming. We studied phylogenetic similarity in cyanobacterial assemblages over spatial and temporal distance, and over environmental gradients, comparing detected patterns with theoretical expectations from deterministic and stochastic processes. We found limited evidence for deviation of lake communities from a random assembly model and no significant effects of geographic distance on phylogenetic similarity, suggesting no dispersal limitation and high levels of stochastic assembly. We detected a weak influence of phosphorus, but no significant effect of nitrogen levels on deviation of community phylogenies from random. We found however a significant decay of phylogenetic similarity for non-random communities over a gradient of air temperature and water column stability. We show how phylogenetic data from sedimentary archives can improve our understanding of microbial community assembly processes, and support previous evidence that climate warming has been the strongest environmental driver of cyanobacterial community assembly over the past century.","2019","9","10.1038/s41598-019-43814-2","me","not yet"

Despite the importance of diazotrophic mediation of nitrogen cycling in riparian ecosystems, knowledge concerning the impacts of dam construction on diazotrophic function and community composition remains very limited. Here, riparian soils were collected from control sites and dam-affected sites located in six cascade dam-formed reservoirs on the Lancang River, China. Diazotrophic activity was assessed by measuring nitrogen fixation rate, while bacterial abundance and community composition were determined with the n(tH gene, using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and MiSeq sequencing, respectively. The results indicate that the activity, abundance, and a-diversity of diazotrophs in the affected sites were significantly higher than those in the control sites. The diazotrophic community composition was differed between the control and affected sites, with the latter showing significantly lower community dissimilarity than the control. Both geographic distance and environmental heterogeneity varied in the diazotrophic community, while environmental heterogeneity was the primary factor controlling diazotrophic assemblage in riparian soils, especially at the affected sites. Moreover, co-occurrence network analyses revealed a much higher possible network connectivity at the affected sites than at the control sites. This study suggests distinct activity, abundance, distribution pattern, and network structure of the diazotrophic populations in riparian soils between dam-affected and control sites; thus, providing a novel insight into the potential ecological effects of dam construction on nitrogen cycling.","2019","132","10.1016/j.soilbio.2019.01.020","me","not yet"

The rhizosphere is a focus of soil microbial communities, but the patterns and drivers of these communities have rarely been studied in alpine ecosystems. We used high-throughput Illumina sequencing to examine the community variations of bacteria, archaea and fungi between the rhizosphere and bulk soil along an altitudinal gradient in an Abies fabri (Mast.) community on Mount Gongga of the eastern Tibetan Plateau. Microbial alpha diversity and community structure varied significantly with altitude but not between the rhizosphere and bulk soil. Soil temperature and the carbon:nitrogen ratio were the primary drivers of the structures of the bacterial, archaeal and fungal communities, and altitude (geographic distance) contributed a small part (< 3%) of the community variation, indicating that various edaphic factors were the key regulators of microbial community variation. This consistency of the microbial communities between the rhizosphere and bulk soil in this alpine ecosystem could be attributed to low temperature and high nutrient content. The bacterial, archaeal and fungal communities were governed by specific environmental factors (total phosphorus content for bacteria; organic-carbon content, dissolved organic-carbon content, NH4+-N content and nutrient stoichiometry for archaea and NO3--N content for fungi). The distinct environmental responses of the microbial taxa suggested metabolic separation and resource preferences of the belowground communities, even within the small-scale spatial distances in this alpine ecosystem. Our study suggested that the ecosystem harbored many microbial taxa with diverse nutrient preferences and metabolic characteristics and could thus potentially tolerate the soil environmental variation under a scenario of climate change.","2019","338","10.1016/j.geoderma.2018.11.047","me","not yet"

Here, we investigated the taxonomic and functional diversity patterns of soil microbial communities by coupling the data obtained from marker genes sequencing and functional gene surveys. Meanwhile, we evaluated the relative effects of environment and geographic distance on shaping these patterns in alpine grasslands of northern China. Although the taxonomic diversity and composition of microbial communities varied across sites, we found no consistent changes in the functional structure. Both the environmental factors and geographic distance concurrently affected the taxonomic diversity patterns but they had no effects on the spatial variations in functional genes. The functional alpha diversity was weakly correlated to the taxonomic alpha diversity across sites. Moreover, we found no significant relationship between the taxonomic and functional composition similarity among microbial communities. Together, our results provide evidence that spatial variation in microbial functions could be independent of their variations in taxonomic diversity. Even the drivers of spatial variations in the functional structure could be totally different from those of taxonomic variations such as environmental differences and dispersal limitation. Our findings suggest that spatial variations of microbial function structure within a community would not follow the variations of taxonomic structures due to different drivers between both of them over space.

Paddy soils, collected from different long-term fertilization treatments across a wide geographic area in subtropical China, were used to evaluate the spatial variation of HS chemical composition. The 3 dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy combined with parallel factor analysis was used to evaluate the chemical composition of the soil extractable humic substance (EHS, including humic acid and fulvic acid). Analysis of distance-decay relationship (DDR) was introduced here to study the spatial variation of the chemical compositions of these EHSs. It was found that geographic location impose greater impact on the compositional variation of soil EHS than fertilization practice. Fertilization treatments including NPK (mineral N, P and K fertilizers) and NPKS (NPK fertilizers plus straw return) exhibited significant flattened DDR slopes as compared to CK (no fertilizers), which indicated fertilization (NPK and NPKS) decreased the variation of EHS chemical composition in paddy soils across geographic distance. A positive correlation was found between variations of soil bacterial community and EHS chemical composition, and fertilization (NPK and NPKS) enhanced their relationships. This work demonstrated that although the geographic location mainly dominated the spatial variation of the soil EHS chemical composition across geographic distance, the same long-term fertilization practice could gradually domesticate the paddy soils to display more similar EHS composition.","2019","186","10.1016/j.still.2018.10.014","me","not yet"

Here, we report about composition and phylogenetic diversity of two clades of NCY in ten lakes of the European peri-Alpine region, over the past similar to 100 years. Using 16S rDNA sequences obtained from dated sediment cores, we found almost equal proportion of taxa assigned to Melainabacteria and the deepest-branching group Sericytochromatia (ML635J-21) (63 total detected taxa). The topology of our reconstructed phylogenies reflected evolutionary relationships expected from previous work, that is, a clear separation between the deepest branching Sericytochromatia, the Melainabacteria, and the photosynthetic cyanobacteria clades. While different lakes harbored distinct NCY communities, the diversity of NCY assemblages within and between lakes (alpha and beta diversity) did not significantly change over the last century. This is in contrast with what was previously reported for photosynthetic cyanobacteria. Unchanged community phylogenetic similarity over geographic distance indicated no dispersal limitation of NCY at the regional scale. Our results solicit studies linking in-lake environmental factors to the composition of these microorganisms communities, whose assembly appeared not to have been influenced by large-scale anthropogenic environmental changes. This is the first attempt to study the diversity and distribution of NCY taxa across temperate lakes.

Samples from the USVI site showed high temporal variability in local population structure, which correlated with changes in salinity and benthic habitat cover. In some cases, temporal variability exceeded spatial differentiation, despite apparent lack of connectivity and dispersal across the Greater Caribbean Region based on the spatial genetic data. Thus, local processes such as selection might have a stronger influence on population structure in microorganisms than geographic distance. The observed high temporal genetic diversity challenges the prediction of harmful algal blooms and toxin concentrations, but illustrates also the evolutionary potential of microalgae to respond to environmental change.","2018","5","10.3389/fmars.2018.00393","me","not yet"

The results showed that the abundant sub-communities were mainly composed of Chloroflexi, Proteobacteria, Deinococcus-Thermus, Aquificae, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes. In contrast, the rare sub-communities mainly consisted of most newly proposed or candidate phyla of Dictyoglomi, Hydrogenedentes, Atribacteria, Hadesarchaea, Aminicenantes, Microgenomates, Calescamantes, Omnitrophica, Altiarchaeales, and Chlamydiae. However, the abundant and rare sub-communities shared some common phyla (e.g., Crenarchaeota, Bathyarchaeota, and Chlorobi), which were composed of different OTUs. The abundant, intermediate, and rare sub-communities were mainly influenced by different environmental variables, which could be ascribed to the fact that they may have different growth and activity and thus respond differently to these variables. Spatial factors showed more contribution to shaping of the intermediate and rare communities than to abundant sub-community, suggesting that the abundant taxa were more easily dispersed than their rare counterparts among hot springs. Microbial ecological function prediction revealed that the abundant and rare sub-communities responded differently to the measured environmental factors, suggesting they may occupy different ecological niches in hot springs. The rare sub-communities may play more important roles in organic matter degradation than their abundant counterparts in hot springs.

We observed that, while species identity was important in characterizing the microflora communities of the two Rattus hosts, environmental factors also had a significant effect. While there was significant geographic variation in the microflora of the noncommensal R.satarae, there was no effect of geographic distance on gut microflora of the commensal R.rattus. Interestingly, host genetic distance did not significantly influence the community in either Rattus hosts. Collectively, these results indicate that a shift in habitat is likely to result in a change in the gut microflora community and imply that the gut microflora is a complex trait, influenced by various parameters in different habitats.","2018","8","10.1002/ece3.4040","me","not yet"

This is the third report of an Afrina species in North America and the first report of this genus in a natural plant population on this continent. Morphological, morphometric, and molecular analyses placed this nematode in genus Afrina and demonstrated that it differs from Afrina hyparrheniae and Afrina spermophaga by having longer body and stylet lengths for females and males, and from Afrina wevelli by the absence of tip irregularities on the tails of female and presence of lips noticeably protruding beyond the body contour. The new species has several characters that overlap with Afrina tumefaciens, but differs from this species by inducing seed galls, whereas Afrina tumefaciens induces ovoid galls on stems, leaves, and in flower heads. Evolutionary relationships of Afrina sporoboliae sp. n. with other representatives of the family Anguinidae are presented based on analysis of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS)1-5.8S-ITS2 rRNA and the D2-D3 regions of the rRNA genes. Analysis of 270 sequences of the coxl gene from 25 populations of Afrina sporoboliae sp. n. revealed seven haplotypes with sequence divergence up to 5%. This study did not demonstrate a significant positive relationship between genetic difference and geographic distance. Seed gall nematodes are important quarantine pests in many countries. The association of this and other seed gall nematodes with Rathayibacter species and their ability to serve as vectors, especially of R. toxicus, is of concern for U.S. agriculture.","2018","108","10.1094/PHYTO-12-17-0395-R","me","not yet"

We analyzed the taxonomic composition and function of microbiomes inhabiting fungal fruiting-bodies in relation to host genetic variation, soil pH and geographic distance between samples. For this, we sequenced the metagenomes of 40 fruiting-bodies collected from six fairy rings (i.e., genets) of a sapro-trophic fungus Marasmius oreades. Our analyses revealed that fine genetic variations between host fungi could strongly affect their associated microbiome, explaining, respectively, 25% and 37% of the variation in microbiome structure and function, whereas geographic distance and soil pH remained of secondary importance.

In order to reveal the effects of alkaline mine drainage (AIkMD) on bacterial and denitrifying bacterial community compositions and diversity in tailings reservoir, here we conducted an experiment to examine all and core bacterial taxa and denitrifying functional geness (nirS, nirK, nosZ(I)) abundance along a chemical gradient in tailings water in Shibahe copper tailings in Zhongtiaoshan, China. Differences in bacterial and denitrifying bacterial community compositions in different habitats and their relationships with environmental parameters were analyzed. The results showed that the richness and diversity of bacterial community in downstream seeping water (SDSW) were the largest, while that in upstream tailings water (STW1) were the lowest. The diversity and abundance of bacterial communities tended to increase from STW1 to SDSW. The variation of bacterial community diversity was significantly related to electro-conductibility (EC), nitrate (NO3-), nitrite (NO2-), total carbon (TC), inorganic carbon (IC) and sulfate (SO42-), but was not correlated with geographic distance in local scale. Core taxa from class to genus were all significantly related to NO3- and NO2-. Core taxa Rhodobacteraceae, Rhodobacter, Acinetobacter and Hydrogenophaga were typical denitrifying bacteria. The variation trends of these groups were consistent with the copy number of nirS, nirK and nosZI, demonstrating their importance in the process of nitrogen reduction. The copy number of nirK, nosZ(I) and nirS/16S rDNA, nirK/16Sr DNA correlated strongly with NON, NOT and IC, but nirS and nosZ(I)/16SrDNA had no significant correlation with NO3- and NOT. The copy numbers of denitrifying functional genes (nirS, nirK and nosZI) were negatively correlated with heavy metal plumbum (Pb) and zinc (Zn). It showed that heavy metal contamination was an important factor affecting the structure of denitrifying bacterial community in AIkMD. In this study we have identified the distribution pattern of bacterial community along physiochemical gradients in alkaline tailings reservoir and displayed the driving force of shaping the structure of bacterial community.

We sought to determine the contribution of geographic distance (as a proxy for dispersal limitation) and phenotypic traits (as a proxy for environmental sorting), including morphology, metabolic ability and interspecific competitiveness, to the genotypic diversity in a nectar yeast species, Metschnikowia reukaufii. To measure genotypic diversity, we sequenced the genomes of 102 strains of M. reukaufii isolated from the floral nectar of hummingbird-pollinated shrub, Mimulus aurantiacus, along a 200-km coastline in California. Intraspecific genetic variation showed no detectable relationship with geographic distance, but could be grouped into three distinct lineages that correlated with metabolic ability and interspecific competitiveness. Despite ample evidence for strong competitive interactions within and among nectar yeasts, a full spectrum of the genotypic and phenotypic diversity observed across the 200-km coastline was represented even at a scale as small as 200 m. Further, more competitive strains were not necessarily more abundant. These results suggest that dispersal limitation and environmental sorting might not fully explain intraspecific diversity in this microbe and highlight the need to also consider other ecological factors such as trade-offs, source-sink dynamics and niche modification.","2018","27","10.1111/mec.14535","me","not yet"

However, limited is known about the benthic algal community distribution and how they are influenced by geographic distance and environmental variables in alpine lakes. Here, we investigated the benthic algal community compositions in the surface sediments of six lakes on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP), China (salinity ranging from 0.8 to 365.6 g/L; pairwise geographic distance among the studied lakes ranging 8-514 km) employing an integrated approach including Illumina-Miseq sequencing and environmental geochemistry. The results showed that the algal communities of the studied samples were mainly composed of orders of Bacillariales, Ceramiales, Naviculales, Oscillatoriales, Spirulinales, Synechococcales, and Vaucheriales. The benthic algal community compositions in these QTP lakes were significantly (p < 0.05) correlated with many environmental (e.g., dissolved inorganic and organic carbon, illumination intensity, total nitrogen and phosphorus, turbidity and water temperature) and spatial factors, and salinity did not show significant influence on the benthic algal community structures in the studied lakes. Furthermore, geographic distance showed strong, significant correlation (r = 0.578, p < 0.001) with the benthic algal community compositions among the studied lakes, suggesting that spatial factors may play important roles in influencing the benthic algal distribution.

Here we use the population genomic signatures expected from the serial founder effects of a geographic range expansion to infer the origin of USA300-NAE and identify polymorphisms associated with its spread. Genome sequences from 357 isolates from 22 U.S. states and territories and seven other countries are compared. We observe two significant signatures of range expansion, including decreases in genetic diversity and increases in derived allele frequency with geographic distance from the Pennsylvania region. These signatures account for approximately half of the core nucleotide variation of this clone, occur genome wide, and are robust to heterogeneity in temporal sampling of isolates, human population density, and recombination detection methods. The potential for positive selection of a gyrA fluoroquinolone resistance allele and several intergenic regions, along with a 2.4 times higher recombination rate in a resistant subclade, is noted. These results are the first to show a pattern of genetic variation that is consistent with a range expansion of an epidemic bacterial clone, and they highlight a rarely considered but potentially common mechanism by which genetic drift may profoundly influence bacterial genetic variation. IMPORTANCE The process of geographic spread of an origin population by a series of smaller populations can result in distinctive patterns of genetic variation. We detect these patterns for the first time with an epidemic bacterial clone and use them to uncover the clones geographic origin and variants associated with its spread. We study the USA300 clone of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, which was first noticed in the early 2000s and subsequently became the leading cause of skin and soft tissue infections in the United States. The eastern United States is the most likely origin of epidemic USA300. Relatively few variants, which include an antibiotic resistance mutation, have persisted during this clones spread.

In comparison with studies on bacterial diversity, limited is known about archaeal diversity and its response to influencing factors in lakes. Here, we investigated the archaeal community compositions (ACCs) and their correlation with spatial/environmental factors in the sediments from 38 Chinese lakes with a large range of salinity (0.2-363.1 g/l) and pairwise geographic distance (3-3656 km). Illumina-Miseq sequencing was employed to characterize the ACCs in the lakes samples. The results showed that Euryarchaeota, Bathyarchaeota, Thaumarchaeota, and Woesearchaeota were the dominant archaeal phyla in the studied samples, and they each can occur in the samples with a wide range of salinity (0.2-363.1 g/l) although their abundance was relatively low (<1%) in certain samples. The Thaumarchaeota and Woesearchaeota phyla dominated (up to 90% of total sequences) some lake sediments. Mantel test indicated that compositions of total archaeal community and the Euryarchaeota and Woesearchaeota populations were significantly (p < 0.05) correlated with geographic distance in the studied lake sediments. Salinity was the most important environmental factor influencing the compositions of the total archaeal community and the Euryarchaeota population, while it did not show significant influence on the distribution of the Woesearchaeota and Thaumarchaeota populations.

In the sea, they play key roles in various global biogeochemical processes. Here, in order to investigate the vertical profiles of archaeal community across a large geographic distance, the compositions of archaeal communities in seven seawater columns in the Pacific Ocean were investigated using high throughput 454 pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. The surface archaeal communities showed lower diversity and greater variability than those in the deeper layers. Two of the major archaeal phyla that displayed different depth preferences were Thaumarchaeota and Euryarchaeota. The majority of Thaumarchaeota belonged to Marine Group I (MGI), which had high relative abundance in deep water. In contrast, Euryarchaeota, which mainly consisted of Marine Group II (MGII) and III (MGIII), were dominant in the surface layer. Compared with MGI and MGII, MGIII were less abundant in seawater and generally absent from the surface water of the subarctic Pacific. In addition, niche separation in the MGI, MGII, and MGIII subgroups was also observed. For example, MGI.C and MGII. A (the major subgroups of MGI and MGII, respectively) displayed a strong negative correlation with each other. The highest level of archaeal diversity was found in the core of an oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) located off Costa Rica, which resulted from the co-occurrence of both anaerobic and aerobic archaea. For example, methanotrophic archaea ANME-2, methanogenic archaea and several sediment origin archaea, such as Marine Benthic Group A (MBGA) and Bathyarchaeota, were all detected at relatively high abundance in the OMZ. Together, our findings indicate that vertical heterogeneities along water columns and latitudinal differentiation in the surface waters are ubiquitous features of archaeal communities in the Pacific Ocean, and the OMZ off Costa Rica is an archaeal biodiversity hot-spot.","2017","8","10.3389/fmicb.2017.02057","me","not yet"

These sequences were aligned with seven previously reported complete genome sequences of SBV from other countries, and various genomic regions were compared. The Vietnamese SBVs (VN-SBVs) shared 91-99% identity with each other, and shared 89-94% identity with strains from other countries. The open reading frames (ORFs) of the VN-SBV genomes differed greatly from those of SBVs from other countries, especially in their VP1 sequences. The AmSBV-Viet6 and AcSBV-Viet9 genome encodes 17 more amino acids within this region than the other VN-SBVs. In a phylogenetic analysis, the strains AmSBV-Viet4, AcSBV-Viet2, and AcSBV-Viet3 were clustered in group with AmSBV-UK, AmSBV-Kor21, and AmSBV-Kor19 strains. Whereas, the strains AmSBV-Viet6 and AcSBV-Viet7 clustered separately with the AcSBV strains from Korea and AcSBV-VietSBM2.

The VN-SBVs possess genetic characteristics which are more similar to the Asian AcSBV strains than to AmSBV-UK strain.

Here we investigated the internal relationships between soil fungal diversity, plant diversity and productivity across 60 grassland sites on the Tibetan Plateau, using Illumina sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) region for fungal identification. Fungal alpha and beta diversities were best explained by plant alpha and beta diversities, respectively, when accounting for environmental drivers and geographic distance. The best ordinary least squares (OLS) multiple regression models, partial least squares regression (PLSR) and variation partitioning analysis (VPA) indicated that plant richness was positively correlated with fungal richness. However, no correlation between plant richness and fungal richness was evident for fungal functional guilds when analyzed individually. Plant productivity showed a weaker relationship to fungal diversity which was intercorrelated with other factors such as plant diversity, and was thus excluded as a main driver.

Therefore, we collected 39 soil samples from a riparian oasis zone (ROZ) to the circumjacent desert zone (CDZ) at the lower reaches of Heihe River to evaluate bacterial communities based on the 16S rRNA gene data. We found that the bacterial community composition differed between ROZ and CDZ habitats, with significantly higher relative abundance of the phyla Gemmatimonadetes and Acidobacteria in ROZ, whereas the abundance of the phyla Actinobacteria and Deinococcus-Thermus was greater in CDZ. The difference in the bacterial community was almost entirely generated by the species turnover rather than the nestedness among all samples. In addition, we found that bacterial alpha-diversity index showed no significant difference between ROZ and CDZ habitats. The distance-decay analysis showed that spatial distance, plant community, soil property, and plant functional trait were correlated with bacterial community variations. However, the variation partition analysis (VPA) revealed that both soil properties and plant community strongly explained the difference [such as soil water content (WC), soil silt content, and plant community structure] compared with plant functional traits in bacterial beta-diversity and species turnover. Based on a co-occurrence network analysis, we found that the bacterial network of ROZ, which had more negative correlations, higher average connectivity, shorter average path length, and smaller modularity, was more complex than the network of CDZ. This suggested that the bacterial community was more stable and less vulnerable to change in the ROZ habitat than in the CDZ habitat. Overall, our findings suggest that the heterogeneity of soil properties and plant community collectively affect the structure of the soil bacterial community in an arid inland river basin. However, the influence of plant functional traits on the variation of the bacterial community depends on soil properties and plant community.","2019","10","10.3389/fmicb.2019.02655","me","not yet"

Here, we investigated the temporal stability of bacterial and fungal communities in the soil and how their temporal variation varies between grasses and forb species. We established 30 outdoor mesocosms consisting of six plant monocultures and followed microbial communities for an entire year in these soils. We demonstrate that bacterial communities vary greatly over time and that turnover plays an important role in shaping microbial communities. We further show that bacterial communities rapidly shift from one state to another and that this is related to changes in the relative contribution of certain taxa rather than to extinction. Fungal soil communities are more stable over time, and a large part of the variation can be explained by plant species and by whether they are grasses or forbs. Our findings show that the soil bacterial community is shaped by time, while plant group and plant species-specific effects drive soil fungal communities. This has important implications for plant-soil research and highlights that temporal dynamics of soil communities cannot be ignored in studies on plant-soil feedback and microbial community composition and function. IMPORTANCE Our findings highlight how soil fungal and bacterial communities respond to time, season, and plant species identity. We found that succession shapes the soil bacterial community, while plant species and the type of plant species that grows in the soil drive the assembly of soil fungal communities. Future research on the effects of plants on soil microbes should take into consideration the relative roles of both time and plant growth on creating soil legacies that impact future plants growing in the soil. Understanding the temporal (in)stability of microbial communities in soils will be crucial for predicting soil microbial composition and functioning, especially as plant species compositions will shift with global climatic changes and land-use alterations. As fungal and bacterial communities respond to different environmental cues, our study also highlights that the selection of study organisms to answer specific ecological questions is not trivial and that the timing of sampling can greatly affect the conclusions made from these studies.","2019","10","10.1128/mBio.02635-19","me","not yet"

Here, we characterize soil microbial beta-diversity at two spatial scales and at multiple phylogenetic grains to ask how archaeal, bacterial and fungal communities are shaped by abiotic processes and biotic interactions with plants. We characterized microbial and plant communities using DNA metabarcoding of soil samples distributed across and within eighteen plots along an elevation gradient in the French Alps. The recovered taxa were placed onto phylogenies to estimate microbial and plant beta-diversity at different phylogenetic grains (i.e. resolution). We then modeled microbial beta-diversities with respect to plant beta-diversities and environmental dissimilarities across plots (landscape scale) and with respect to plant beta-diversities and spatial distances within plots (plot scale). At the landscape scale, fungal and archaeal beta-diversities were mostly related to plant beta-diversity, while bacterial beta-diversities were mostly related to environmental dissimilarities. At the plot scale, we detected a modest covariation of bacterial and fungal beta-diversities with plant beta-diversity; as well as a distance-decay relationship that suggested the influence of ecological drift on microbial communities. In addition, the covariation between fungal and plant beta-diversity at the plot scale was highest at fine or intermediate phylogenetic grains hinting that biotic interactions between those clades depends on early-evolved traits. Altogether, we show how multiple ecological processes determine soil microbial community assembly at different spatial scales and how the strength of these processes change among microbial clades.

Zeta diversity provides a common currency and conceptual framework that links incidence-based metrics with multiple patterns of interest in biology, ecology, and biodiversity science. It quantifies the variation in species (or OTU) composition of multiple assemblages (or cases) in space or time, to capture the contribution of the full suite of narrow, intermediate, and wide-ranging species to biotic heterogeneity. Here we provide a conceptual framework for the application and interpretation of patterns of continuous change in compositional diversity using zeta diversity. This includes consideration of the survey design context, and the multiple ways in which zeta diversity decline and decay can be used to examine and test turnover in the identity of elements across space and time. We introduce the zeta ratio-based retention rate curve to quantify rates of compositional change. We illustrate these applications using 11 empirical data sets from a broad range of taxa, scales, and levels of biological organization-from DNA molecules and microbes to communities and interaction networks-including one of the original data sets used to express compositional change and distance decay in ecology. We show (1) how different sample selection schemes used during the calculation of compositional change are appropriate for different data types and questions, (2) how higher orders of zeta may in some cases better detect shifts and transitions, and (3) the relative roles of rare vs. common species in driving patterns of compositional change. By exploring the application of zeta diversity decline and decay, including the retention rate, across this broad range of contexts, we demonstrate its application for understanding continuous turnover in biological systems.","2019","100","10.1002/ecy.2832","me","not yet"

Physical structures, biotic components and abiotic conditions create a patchwork mosaic of potential niches for microbes. Questions remain about mechanisms and patterns of community assembly belowground, including: Do fungal and bacterial communities assemble differently? How do microbes reach the roots of host plants? Within a 4 m(2) plot in alpine vegetation, high throughput sequencing of the 16S (bacteria) and ITS1 (fungal) ribosomal RNA genes was used to characterise microbial community composition in roots and adjacent soil of a viviparous host plant (Bistorta vivipara). At fine spatial scales, beta-diversity patterns in belowground bacterial and fungal communities were consistent, although compositional change was greater in bacteria than fungi. Spatial structure and distance-decay relationships were also similar for bacteria and fungi, with significant spatial structure detected at < 50 cm among root-but not soil-associated microbes. Recruitment of root microbes from the soil community appeared limited at this sampling and sequencing depth. Possible explanations for this include recruitment from low-abundance populations of soil microbes, active recruitment from neighbouring plants and/or vertical transmission of symbionts to new clones, suggesting varied methods of microbial community assembly for viviparous plants.

The spatial distribution of Vibrio was governed by a joint effect of spatial and environmental factors (especially temperature, salinity, and SiO32-), and their respective pure effects explained only a small fraction of the community variation. Moreover, we identified the most prominent operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that were partitioned in these sea areas. Whereas Vibrionaceae OTU20 and Photobacterium lipolyticum were prevalent in the YS, Vibrio gigantic and Photobacterium piscicola, and P. piscicola, Photobacterium lutimaris, and Photobacterium alginatilyticum were prevalent in the ECS and SCS, respectively. Our study demonstrated clear spatial heterogeneity of Vibrio spp. in sediments of the Chinese marginal seas, laying a foundation for fully understanding the marine Vibrio ecology and the ecological roles of the species. IMPORTANCE Vibrio is an important component of natural marine microbial populations in terms of pathogenicity and roles in carbon cycling. Compared to the marine pelagic environment, our knowledge of the diversity and distribution pattern of Vibrio spp. in sediment is limited. Here, we show higher Vibrio abundance in Chinese marginal seas than in other studied sediments. There was a clear spatial differentiation of Vibrio abundance and community composition in different sea areas. The benthic Vibrio community displayed a strong distance-decay pattern across a wide spatial range, which was formed under the combined effects of spatial and environmental factors. These results provide deep insights into the ecological dynamics of Vibrio and its environmental controls, facilitating a more comprehensive understanding of the marine Vibrio ecology.","2019","85","10.1128/AEM.03064-18","me","not yet"

Here, we conducted a comprehensive, continental-scale survey of soil archaeal communities in adjacent pairs of maize (dryland) and rice (wetland) fields in eastern China.ResultsWe revealed the consequential roles of environmental filtering in driving archaeal community assembly for both maize and rice fields. Rice fields, abundant with Euryarchaeota, had higher archaeal diversity and steeper distance-decay slopes than maize fields dominated by Thaumarchaeota. Dominant soil archaea showed distinct continental atlases and niche differentiation between dryland and wetland habitats, where they were associated with soil pH and mean annual temperature, respectively. After identifying their environmental preferences, we grouped the dominant archaeal taxa into different ecological clusters and determined the unique co-occurrence patterns within each cluster. Using this empirical dataset, we built a continental atlas of soil archaeal communities to provide reliable estimates of their spatial distributions in agricultural ecosystems.ConclusionsEnvironmental filtering plays a crucial role in driving the distinct continental atlases of dominant soil archaeal communities between dryland and wetland, with contrasting strategies of archaeal-driven nutrient cycling within these two agricultural ecosystems. These findings improve our ability to predict how soil archaeal communities respond to environmental changes and to manage soil archaeal communities for provisioning of agricultural ecosystem services.","2019","7","10.1186/s40168-019-0630-9","me","not yet"

Here we applied shotgun metagenomics sequencing to study microbial community dynamics and function in planktonic samples collected along an approximately 700 km river transect, including urban cities and rural settings in upstream waters, before and after the monsoon rainy season. Our results showed that 11%-32% of the microbes represented terrestrial, sewage and human inputs (allochthonous). Sewage inputs significantly contributed to the higher abundance, by 13-fold of human gut microbiome (HG) associated sequences and 2-fold of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the Ganges relative to other riverine ecosystems in Europe, North and South America. Metagenome-assembled genome sequences (MAGs) representing allochthonous populations were detectable and tractable across the river after 1-2 days of (downstream) transport (> 200 km apart). Only approximately 8% of these MAGs were abundant in U.S. freshwater ecosystems, revealing distinct biodiversity for the Ganges. Microbial communities in the rainy season exhibited increased alpha-diversity and spatial heterogeneity and showed significantly weaker distance-decay patterns compared with the dry season. These results advance our understanding of the Ganges microbial communities and how they respond to anthropogenic pollution.","2019","21","10.1111/1462-2920.14439","me","not yet"

We investigated the spatial structure, specifically distance-decay of similarity, of soil bacterial and fungal communities in two long-established orchards with contrasting agronomic characteristics. A spatially explicit sampling strategy was used to collect soil from under recently grubbed rows of apple trees and under the grassed aisles. Amplicon-based metabarcoding technology was used to characterise the soil microbial communities. The results suggested that (1) most of the differences in soil microbial community structure were due to large-scale differences (i.e. between orchards), (2) within-orchard, small-scale (1-5 m) spatial variability was also present, but spatial relationships in microbial community structure differed between orchards and were not predictable, and (3) vegetation type (i.e. trees or grass and their associated management) can significantly alter the structure of soil microbial communities, affecting a large proportion of microbial groups. The discontinuous nature of soil microbial community structure in the tree stations and neighbouring grass aisles within an orchard illustrate the importance of vegetation type and allied weed and nutrient management on soil microbial community structure.","2018","130","10.1016/j.apsoil.2018.05.015","me","not yet"

These investigations can reveal the process, infrastructure, and environmental factors that influence the microbial community, offering opportunities to re-think microbial management in drinking water systems. Often, these insights are missed or are unreliable in short-term studies, which are impacted by stochastic variabilities inherent to large full-scale systems. In this two-year study, we investigated the spatial and temporal dynamics of the microbial community in a large, full scale South African drinking water distribution system that uses three successive disinfection strategies (i.e. chlorination, chloramination and hypochlorination). Monthly bulk water samples were collected from the outlet of the treatment plant and from 17 points in the distribution system spanning nearly 150 km and the bacterial community composition was characterised by Illumina MiSeq sequencing of the V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene. Like previous studies, Alpha- and Betaproteobacteria dominated the drinking water bacterial communities, with an increase in Betaproteobacteria post-chloramination. In contrast with previous reports, the observed richness, diversity, and evenness of the bacterial communities were higher in the winter months as opposed to the summer months in this study. In addition to temperature effects, the seasonal variations were also likely to be influenced by changes in average water age in the distribution system and corresponding changes in disinfectant residual concentrations. Spatial dynamics of the bacterial communities indicated distance decay, with bacterial communities becoming increasingly dissimilar with increasing distance between sampling locations. These spatial effects dampened the temporal changes in the bulk water community and were the dominant factor when considering the entire distribution system. However, temporal variations were consistently stronger as compared to spatial changes at individual sampling locations and demonstrated seasonality. This study emphasises the need for long-term studies to comprehensively understand the temporal patterns that would otherwise be missed in short-term investigations. Furthermore, systematic long-term investigations are particularly critical towards determining the impact of changes in source water quality, environmental conditions, and process operations on the changes in microbial community composition in the drinking water distribution system.

"Wang, ZY; Ye, XY; Lee, J; Chang, XM; Liu, HM; Li, QQ","A spatial econometric modeling of online social interactions using microblogs","COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS","With the advent of Information and Communication technology (ICT) in modern age, the statement of death of distance has received numerous discussions. This article contributes a new empirical study to the debate of death of distance by considering the effect of spatial autocorrelation in the estimation of distance decay effect with the incorporation of network autocorrelation in spatial econometric modeling. This work is based on a city level dataset from Chinas largest social networking site called Weibo. The findings are shown as following. First, the coefficient value of network autocorrelation term (0.007, significant at 0.01 level) suggests that the city-level online social links are spatially dependent. In other words, these social connections are not randomly distributed across space but tend to form spatial clusters where neighboring links are more similar. Second, controlling spatial autocorrelation in the data, a distance decay effect on the formation of online social links is unveiled with a much smaller scaling exponent of the distances (i.e., 0.276) as compared to those (e.g., 2.0, 1.8, 1.45, 1.06, 1.03, 0.4, and 0.5) in existing studies. This research provides a useful modeling framework to analyze the real world driving forces that characterize the patterns of social interactions in virtual space and thus advance our understanding in the connection of virtual and real spaces.","2018","70","10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2018.02.001","me","not yet"

Our research aimed to characterize the genes and organisms from two different WWTPs that discharge into Lake Michigan, as well as from surrounding lake sediments to determine the dispersal and fate of these factors with respect to distance from the effluent outfall. Shotgun metagenomics coupled to distance-decay analyses showed a higher abundance of genes identical to those in WWTP effluent genes in sediments closer to outfall sites than in sediments farther away, indicating their possible WWTP origin. We also found genes attributed to organisms, such as those belonging to Helicobacteraceae, Legionellaceae, Moraxellaceae, and Neisseriaceae, in effluent from both WWTPs and decreasing in abundance in lake sediments with increased distance from WWTPs. Moreover, our results showed that the WWTPs likely influence the ARG composition in lake sediments close to the effluent discharge. Many of these ARGs were located on MGEs in both the effluent and sediment samples, indicating a relatively broad propensity for horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Our approach allowed us to specifically link genes to organisms and their genetic context, providing insight into WWTP impacts on natural microbial communities. Overall, our results suggest a substantial influence of wastewater effluent on gene content and microbial community structure in the sediments of receiving water bodies. IMPORTANCE Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) release their effluent into aquatic environments. Although treated, effluent retains many genes and microorganisms that have the potential to influence the receiving water in ways that are poorly understood. Here, we tracked the genetic footprint, including genes specific to antibiotic resistance and mobile genetic elements and their associated organisms, from WWTPs to lake sediments. Our work is novel in that we used metagenomic data sets to comprehensively evaluate total gene content and the genetic and taxonomic context of specific genes in environmental samples putatively impacted by WWTP inputs. Based on two different WWTPs with different treatment processes, our findings point to an influence of WWTPs on the presence, abundance, and composition of these factors in the environment.","2018","84","10.1128/AEM.02168-17","me","not yet"

With the increasing shipping activities, the risk of oil spills remains high. Archaea are widely distributed in many environments. However, the distribution and the response of archaeal communities to oil contamination have rarely been investigated in brackish habitats. Hence, we conducted a survey to investigate the distribution, diversity, composition, and species interactions of indigenous archaeal communities at oil-contaminated sites along the coast of the Gulf of Finland (GoF) using high-throughput sequencing. Surface water and littoral sediment samples were collected at presumably oil-contaminated (oil distribution facilities) and clean sites along the coastline of the GoF in the winter 2015 and the summer 2016. Another three samples of open sea surface water were taken as offshore references. Of Archaea, Euryarchaeota dominated in the surface water and the littoral sediment of the coast of the GoF, followed by Crenarchaeota (including Thaumarchaeota, Thermoprotei, and Korarchaeota based on the Greengenes database used). The unclassified sequences accounted for 5.62% of the total archaeal sequences. Our study revealed a strong dependence of the archaeal community composition on environmental variables (e.g., salinity, pH, oil concentration, TOM, electrical conductivity, and total DNA concentration) in both littoral sediment and coastal water in the GoF. The composition of archaeal communities was season and ecosystem dependent. Archaea was highly diverse in the three ecosystems (littoral sediment, coastal water, and open sea water). Littoral sediment harbored the highest diversity of archaea. Oil was often detected in the littoral sediment but rarely detected in water at those presumably contaminated sites. Although the composition of archaeal community in the littoral sediment was sensitive to low-input oil contamination, the unchanged putative functional profiles and increased interconnectivity of the archaeal core species network plausibly revealed resilience and the potential for oil degradation. Halobacteriaceae and putative cytochrome P450 pathways were significantly enriched in the oil-contaminated littoral sediment. The archaeal taxa formed highly interconnected and interactive networks, in which Halobacteriaceae, Thermococcus, and methanogens were the main components, implying a potential relevant trophic connection between hydrocarbon degradation, methanogenesis, sulfate reduction, and/or fermentative growth.","2018","9","10.3389/fmicb.2018.00015","me","not yet"

Collembola is one of the most abundant groups of soil fauna, which regulates microbial communities by consumption and dispersal. The spatial structure of associations between Collembola and soil microbes have been described in several studies, but temporal variation of these associations remains unclear. Using high throughput sequencing, we studied the fungal communities on Collembola (Entomobiya nivalis, Orchesella flavescens, Pogonognathellus longicornis) body surface, gut and their immediate habitat (topsoil samples) in four seasons across three years. The soil samples were characterized by fairly uniform relative abundance of saprotrophic and mycorrhizal fungi, whereas collembolans were associated mostly with saprotrophs. The structure of fungal communities from all substrate types exhibited comparable patterns of temporal distance decay of shnilarity. Unlike in soil, fungal richness and composition in Collembola body and gut samples exhibited seasonal and annual variation, with a significant interaction term, indicating low predictability. These results reflect spatial and temporal plasticity of the fungal communities associated with epigeic Collembola, indicating the high adaptability of collembolans to available conditions. We found that the Collembola associations with fungi (including diet) did not vary among the studied epigeic Collembola species. The detected high diversity of fungi associated with Collembola suggests that dispersal by arthropod vectors may represent a powerful alternative to aerial dispersal of fungal propagules.","2018","116","10.1016/j.soilbio.2017.10.021","me","not yet"

These responses are largely influenced by coral-associated microbes, but how the coral microbiome changes over small spatial scales has never been quantified before. We performed a high-resolution quantification of the spatial scale of microbial species turnover (ss-diversity) within skeletons of boulder-forming Porites corals. We found very strong prokaryotic species turnover across spatial scales ranging from 4 mm to 2 m within individual colonies, possibly resulting from dispersal limitation and microbial interactions. The microalgal community was more homogeneously distributed, which is likely due to these photosymbionts actively boring through limestone. Our findings highlight unprecedented levels of intra-colony heterogeneity in the skeletal microbiome, which has implications for the experimental design of coral microbiome studies and for our understanding of coral resilience.","2018","12","10.1038/ismej.2017.164","me","not yet"

Urban sewage is potentially a major conduit for dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes into various environmental compartments. However, the diversity and abundance of such genes in wastewater are not well known. Methods: Here, seasonal and geographical distributions of antibiotic resistance genes and their host bacterial communities from Chinese urban sewage were characterized, using metagenomic analyses and 16S rRNA gene-based Illumina sequencing, respectively. Results: In total, 381 different resistance genes were detected, and these genes were extensively shared across China, with no geographical clustering. Seasonal variation in abundance of resistance genes was observed, with average concentrations of 3.27 x 10(11) and 1.79 x 10(12) copies/L in summer and winter, respectively. Bacterial communities did not exhibit geographical clusters, but did show a significant distance-decay relationship (P < 0.01). The core, shared resistome accounted for 57.7% of the total resistance genes, and was significantly associated with the core microbial community (P < 0.01). The core human gut microbiota was also strongly associated with the shared resistome, demonstrating the potential contribution of human gut microbiota to the dissemination of resistance elements via sewage disposal. Conclusions: This study provides a baseline for investigating environmental dissemination of resistance elements and raises the possibility of using the abundance of resistance genes in sewage as a tool for antibiotic stewardship.","2017","5","10.1186/s40168-017-0298-y","me","not yet"

These two subcommunities may have fundamentally different ecological roles, and it is not clear whether their diversity patterns along elevation gradients vary. In this study, we investigated the diversity of bacterioplankton and their subcommunities, i.e., abundant and rare bacterioplankton, in lakes across gradual elevations from 525 m to 4652 m at Siguniang Mountain in western China via the high-throughput sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes. Elevation showed strong influence on bacterioplankton community composition (BCC) and that the dissimilarity of BCC increased with increasing differences in elevation. However, the elevational distance-decay rate of abundant bacterioplankton was higher than that of rare bacterioplankton. Abundant bacterioplankton were more sensitive to changes of environmental factors than rare bacterioplankton. We observed a marginal increase in alpha diversity, estimated as operational taxonomic unit richness and phylogenetic diversity, of overall bacterioplankton with increasing elevation. The alpha diversity of abundant bacterioplankton decreased monotonically with elevation; in contrast, the alpha diversity of rare bacterioplankton increased monotonically with elevation. Null model tests indicated that environmental filtering played a dominant role in overall bacterioplankton community assembly along the elevation gradient, while there was decreased contribution of environmental selection to rare bacterioplankton in smaller lakes at higher elevation. Our results revealed that abundant bacterioplankton followed the general elevation diversity theory commonly found for plants and animals in freshwater lakes, whereas rare bacterioplankton did not follow this tenet.","2017","62","10.1002/lno.10518","me","not yet"
