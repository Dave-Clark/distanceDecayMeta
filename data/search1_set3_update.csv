Here, we directly compare morphological and Illumina data obtained from the same samples, in an effort to characterize ciliate faunas from sediments in freshwater environments. We show how in silico processing affects the final outcome of our HTS analysis, providing evidence that quality filtering protocols strongly impact the number of predicted taxa, but not downstream conclusions such as biogeography patterns. We determine the abundance distribution of ciliates, showing that a small fraction of abundant taxa dominates read counts. At the same time, we advance reasons to believe that biases affecting HTS abundances may be significant enough to blur part of the underlying biological picture. We confirmed that the HTS approach detects many more taxa than morphological inspections, and highlight how the difference varies among taxonomic groups. Finally, we hypothesize that the two datasets actually correspond to different conceptions of diversity, and consequently that neither is entirely superior to the other when investigating environmental protists.",2017,73,10.1007/s00248-016-0912-8
"Thornhill, DJ; Howells, EJ; Wham, DC; Steury, TD; Santos, SR","Population genetics of reef coral endosymbionts (Symbiodinium, Dinophyceae)",MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,"Symbiodinium is a diverse genus of unicellular dinoflagellate symbionts associating with various marine protists and invertebrates. Although the broadscale diversity and phylogenetics of the Symbiodinium complex is well established, there have been surprisingly few data on fine-scale population structure and biogeography of these dinoflagellates. Yet population-level processes contribute strongly to the biology of Symbiodinium, including how anthropogenic-driven global climate change impacts these symbionts and their host associations. Here, we present a synthesis of population-level characteristics for Symbiodinium, with an emphasis on how phylogenetic affinities, dynamics within and among host individuals, and a propensity towards clonality shape patterns on and across reefs. Major inferences include the following: (i) Symbiodinium populations within individual hosts are comprised mainly of cells belonging to a single or few genetic clones. (ii) Symbiont populations exhibit a mixed mode of reproduction, wherein at least one sexual recombination event occurs in the genealogy between most genotypes, but clonal propagation predominates overall. (iii) Mutualistic Symbiodinium do not perpetually persist outside their hosts, instead undergoing turnover and replacement via the continuous shedding of viable clonal cells from host individuals. (iv) Symbiont populations living in the same host, but on different reefs, are often genetically subdivided, suggesting low connectivity, adaptation to local conditions, or prolific asexual reproduction and low effective population sizes leading to disproportionate success within and among hosts. Overall, this synthesis forms a basis for future investigations of coral symbiosis ecology and evolution as well as delimitation of species boundaries in Symbiodinium and other eukaryotic microorganisms.",2017,26,10.1111/mec.14055
"Murphy, HA",Harnessing the power of digital droplet PCR to conduct real-world microbial competitions,MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES,"The budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, has a long and storied history as a model organism for genetic, cellular and molecular biological research. More recently, researchers have sought to understand the ecology and evolution of its sister species, Saccharomyces paradoxus, in part to put our vast knowledge of the model yeast into its natural context (Replansky et al.2008). However, the research tools have been limited, and most investigations into natural populations have either been descriptions of patterns of biogeography or taken the organism back into the laboratory for mating, growth and competition assays (Kuehne et al. 2007; Miller & Greig 2015; Murphy & Zeyl 2015; Samani et al. 2015). The link between what occurs out in the real world and what is measured in the laboratory has not yet been made, as so much is still unknown about the natural history of these yeasts. In this issue of Molecular Ecology Resources, Boynton et al. (2016) take a major step towards bridging laboratory studies with field ecological research. By isolating a panel of S. paradoxus strains from a wooded area, culturing them in the laboratory, reintroducing pairs back into their habitat on natural substrate and monitoring the frequency of individual strains using digital droplet PCR, the researchers were able to use the framework of laboratory-based microbial competitions, but conduct them in a natural setting. While there is still more to learn about how to optimize this approach, it represents an exciting step in microbial ecological research and should prove an important tool for other species and numerous ecological questions.",2017,17,10.1111/1755-0998.12611

"Likar, M; Stres, B; Rusjan, D; Potisek, M; Regvar, M",Ecological and conventional viticulture gives rise to distinct fungal and bacterial microbial communities in vineyard soils,APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY,"The new ecological approach to viticulture emphasises ecologically sound grape production and recognizes the importance of grapevine (Vitis vinifera) interactions with soil microbial communities. Due to different viticulture measures, distinctly different microbial communities can form, which affects the potentially beneficial interactions with the grapevines. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to identify differences in the community structures of fungal and bacterial soil communities on a landscape scale, and to relate these to the type and duration of soil management, and to within vineyard habitats. Soil fungal and bacterial communities were screened in vineyards with different soil management (ecological, conventional) and ages (3, 10, 35 years). In each vineyard, 35 rhizosphere soil samples were acquired from beneath the grapevines and between the rows, using a grid covering of 240 m(2) per vineyard. Automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis of the microbial soil samples was carried out, with the microbial lifeforms compared among the vineyards (bacteria vs. fungi). There was high variability in the local microbial diversity for all of the sampled plots, with significant differences among the vineyards under ecological and conventional soil management. In comparison to fungi, soil management and age of vineyard had significantly greater impact on bacteria. Microbial communities showed no general overlap in diversity spots or simultaneous changes in community composition along the sampling grids. These results suggest that the microbial communities reflect the influences of highly localised biogeographic factors and vineyard management, with the most profound effects observed after deep tillage. Furthermore, fungal and bacterial communities forming in the vineyard soils appear to be influenced by different sets of environmental factors. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The desiccated mat was sampled in 2010 from an ephemeral rock pool at 5500 m above sea level in the Cordillera Vilcanota of southern PerA. After being frozen for 6 years at -20 A degrees C in the lab, pieces of the mat were sequenced to fully characterize both the 16 and 18S microbial communities and experiments were conducted to determine if organisms in the mat could revive and become active under the extreme freeze-thaw conditions that these mats experience in the field. Sequencing revealed an unexpectedly diverse, multi-trophic microbial community with 16S OTU richness comparable to similar, seasonally desiccated mats from the Dry Valleys of Antarctica and low elevation sites in the Atacama Desert region. The bacterial community of the mat was dominated by phototrophs in the Cyanobacteria (Nostoc) and the Rhodospirillales, whereas the eukaryotic community was dominated by predators such as bdelloid rotifers (Philodinidae). Microcosm experiments showed that bdelloid rotifers in the mat were able to come out of dormancy and actively forage even under realistic field conditions (diurnal temperature fluctuations of -12 A degrees C at night to  27 A degrees C during the day), and after being frozen for 6 years. Our results broaden our understanding of the diversity of life in periodically desiccated, high-elevation habitats and demonstrate that extreme freeze-thaw cycles per se are not a major factor limiting the development of at least some members of these unique microbial mat systems.",2017,21,10.1007/s00792-017-0926-2

Composition varied across the watershed, and with variation in nutrients in particular. Although these changes were partially driven by overall abundance, bacterial groups responded to nutrients differently across the watershed. Most groups were correlated with suspended particulate materials, yet, abundance of beta-proteobacteria was highest with elevated nitrate, and abundance of Actinobacteria was highest with elevated soluble reactive phosphate. Land use weakly influenced composition. Landscape position influenced composition, with downstream mainstem riverine sites differing from more upstream and tributary sites. Both production and respiration were influenced by temperature and organic carbon, but we found that production and growth efficiency were not directly related. Production peaked at intermediate levels of abundance, but no groups were correlated with production. Respiration by free-floating bacteria was positively correlated with proportional abundance of alpha-proteobacteria, gamma-proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria. Finally, we found that land use was a relatively weak influence on community composition, but that variation in nutrients was relatively important for both composition and function.",2017,792,10.1007/s10750-016-3058-2

The bulk soil of two greenhouses (following or not the recommended agriculture good practices, FGP and NFGP, respectively) was compared based on their physicochemical properties and bacterial community. In both FGP and NFGP, Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Gemmatimonadetes were in a proportion of 5:1:1:1:1:1. However, the bacterial community of soil FGP was richer and more diverse than that of soil NFGP. Members of the classes Bacilli and Gemm-1, with higher relative abundance in NFGP and FGP, respectively, were those contributing most for distinguishing the bacterial communities of both soils.

Here, we studied the effect of a single addition of biochar on bacterial community compositions in a black soil of northeast China. The biochar was added with dosages of 0%, 2%, 4% and 8% of the total mass of the top 20 cm soils in the spring of 2012, and soil samples were collected seasonally four times in 2014. The abundance and composition of bacterial community were determined using quantitative real-time PCR and Illumina MiSeq sequencing methods, respectively. The results showed that soil pH, moisture, total C, total N, total P, NO3--N, available K and the C/N ratio significantly increased with biochar addition, but that soil bulk density and total K content decreased. The bacterial abundance increased with biochar addition, especially at a higher dosage. The biochar addition increased the alpha-diversity of soil bacterial community and changed the bacterial community compositions. Taxonomic analyses showed that Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi and Bacteroidetes were the dominant phyla in this study, and the relative abundances of Acidobacteria decreased but Chloroflexi increased with biochar addition. Additionally, biochar addition increased the relative abundances of Bacillus and Pedomicrobium, but decreased the relative abundance of Bradyrhizobium. Canonical correspondence analysis indicated that bacterial community compositions were closely associated with soil parameters such as pH, total C, total N and total K. Given the changes of these soil parameters were highly correlated with the amounts of biochar addition, which suggested that the impacts of long-term biochar amendment on the soil bacterial community were linked to the alteration of soil physiochemical properties.

Ecological sub-disciplines, particularly conservation, community ecology and macroecology, all recognize the value of evolutionary relationships but the resulting development of phylogenetic approaches has led to a proliferation of phylogenetic diversity metrics. The use of many metrics across the sub-disciplines hampers potential meta-analyses, syntheses, and generalizations of existing results. Further, there is no guide for selecting the appropriatemetric for a given question, and different metrics are frequently used to address similar questions. To improve the choice, application, and interpretation of phylo-diversity metrics, we organize existing metrics by expanding on a unifying framework for phylogenetic information. Generally, questions about phylogenetic relationships within or between assemblages tend to ask three types of question: how much; how different; or how regular? We show that these questions reflect three dimensions of a phylogenetic tree: richness, divergence, and regularity. We classify 70 existing phylo-diversity metrics based on their mathematical form within these three dimensions and identify anchor representatives: for alpha-diversity metrics these are PD (Faiths phylogenetic diversity), MPD (mean pairwise distance), and VPD (variation of pairwise distances). By analysing mathematical formulae and using simulations, we use this framework to identify metrics that mix dimensions, and we provide a guide to choosing and using the most appropriate metrics. We show that metric choice requires connecting the research question with the correct dimension of the framework and that there are logical approaches to selecting and interpreting metrics.

"Sommer, U; Peter, KH; Genitsaris, S; Moustaka-Gouni, M",Do marine phytoplankton follow Bergmanns rule sensu lato?,BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS,"Global warming has revitalized interest in the relationship between body size and temperature, proposed by Bergmanns rule 150 years ago, one of the oldest manifestations of a biogeography of traits. We review biogeographic evidence, results from clonal cultures and recent micro-and mesocosm experiments with naturally mixed phytoplankton communities regarding the response of phytoplankton body size to temperature, either as a single factor or in combination with other factors such as grazing, nutrient limitation, and ocean acidification. Where possible, we also focus on the comparison between intraspecific size shifts and size shifts resulting from changes in species composition. Taken together, biogeographic evidence, community-level experiments and single-species experiments indicate that phytoplankton average cell sizes tend to become smaller in warmer waters, although temperature is not necessarily the proximate environmental factor driving size shifts. Indirect effects via nutrient supply and grazing are important and often dominate. In a substantial proportion of field studies, resource availability is seen as the only factor of relevance. Interspecific size effects are greater than intraspecific effects. Direct temperature effects tend to be exacerbated by indirect ones, if warming leads to intensified nutrient limitation or copepod grazing while ocean acidification tends to counteract the temperature effect on cell size in non-calcifying phytoplankton. We discuss the implications of the temperature-related size trends in a global-warming context, based on known functional traits associated with phytoplankton size. These are a higher affinity for nutrients of smaller cells, highest maximal growth rates of moderately small phytoplankton (ca. 102 mu m(3)), size-related sensitivities for different types of grazers, and impacts on sinking rates. For a phytoplankton community increasingly dominated by smaller algae we predict that: (i) a higher proportion of primary production will be respired within the microbial food web; (ii) a smaller share of primary production will be channeled to the classic phytoplankton-crustacean zooplankton-fish food chain, thus leading to decreased ecological efficiency from a fish-production point of view; (iii) a smaller share of primary production will be exported through sedimentation, thus leading to decreased efficiency of the biological carbon pump.",2017,92,10.1111/brv.12266

Here we investigated spatial variations of bacterial communities along a precipitation and temperature transect in the eastern Inner Mongolia steppe, China. The aims are to understand the biogeographic pattern and key drivers shaping soil bacterial communities along the transect. Our results shoved that the soil bacterial community along the 451-km transect exhibited the distance-decay relationship, decreasing in community similarity with geographic distance. Obvious changes in the bacterial community structure occurred at an annual precipitation from 215 to 261 mm, which was close to the boundary between arid and semi-arid systems. The relative abundances of Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Acidobacteria increased with precipitation, while those of Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Gemmatimonadetes decreased. Environmental filtering was observed to be the key in shaping bacterial biogeographic patterns, and climate conditions exert indirect effects on soil bacterial communities mainly through direct effects on soil properties. Soil pH and plant coverage were important to soil bacterial communities in both arid and semi-arid steppes.

"Holland, BS; Chiaverano, LM; Howard, CK",Diminished fitness in an endemic Hawaiian snail in nonnative host plants,ETHOLOGY ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION,"Hawaiis diverse achatinellid tree snails occur almost exclusively in host trees and shrubs that are native to the Hawaiian Archipelago. A few exceptions to this pattern are known, where an arboreal gastropod population has persisted in introduced plants. On Oahu, Hawaii, the last known population of the single-island endemic snail Auriculella diaphana has persisted in nonnative plants for multiple decades, leading to the following question: are there differences in the relative fitness of native gastropods in native versus nonnative host plants? To address this we conducted laboratory trials with A. diaphana in three treatment groups, one with the two dominant nonnative host plants from their current distribution, another group with two primary native host plant species, and a third treatment maintained in cages with a mixture of equal parts of both the nonnative and native plants. Trials were replicated in two 16-week intervals, with 100 snails. Relative fitness was assessed among treatments as survival and reproductive output (number of eggs produced). Results demonstrated that while survival of adult snails was equivalent across treatments (100%), fecundity was significantly higher in cages where native plants were available. Egg production was 20.05-fold and 14.95-fold greater in treatments with 100% and 50% native host plants, respectively, than in treatments with nonnative plants only. These results suggest that native snails persisting in nonnative host plants experience sublethal stress, reflected in a dramatic reduction in reproductive output. Snails in treatments with mixed native and nonnative plants also showed significantly higher reproduction than those in nonnative plant cages. We suggest that the observed decreased fecundity was due to the poor nutritional value of the microbial phyllosphere of nonnative vegetation, and that translocation of this and related species occurring in nonnative habitat to nearby native host plants will be beneficial in terms of relative fitness.",2017,29,10.1080/03949370.2016.1143406

We selected 529 species to address phylogenetic relationships of higher-level taxa using a maximum-likelihood framework and sequence data from six genes traditionally used in fungal molecular systematics (nrLSU, nrSSU, 5.8S, tef1-alpha, rpb1 and rpb2). These species represent 18 classes, 62 orders, 183 families, and 392 genera from the phyla Basidiomycota (including the newly recognized subphylum Wallemiomycotina) and Entorrhizomycota, and 13 species representing 13 classes of Ascomycota as outgroup taxa. We also conducted a molecular dating analysis based on these six genes for 116 species representing 17 classes and 54 orders of Basidiomycota and Entorrhizomycota. Finally we performed a phyloproteomics analysis from 109 Basidiomycota species and 6 outgroup taxa using amino-acid sequences retrieved from 396 orthologous genes. Recognition of higher taxa follows the criteria in Zhao et al (Fungal Divers 78: 239-292, 2016): (i) taxa must be monophyletic and statistically well-supported in molecular dating analyses, (ii) their respective stem ages should be roughly equivalent, and (iii) stem ages of higher taxa must be older than those of lower level taxa. The time-tree indicates that the mean of stem ages of Basidiomycota and Entorrhizomycota are ca. 530 Ma; subphyla of Basidiomycota are 406-490 Ma; most classes are 358-393 Ma for those of Agaricomycotina and 245-356 Ma for those of Pucciniomycotina and Ustilaginomycotina; most orders of those subphyla split 120-290 Ma. Monophyly of most higher-level taxa of Basidiomycota are generally supported, especially those taxa introduced in the recent ten years: phylum Entorrhizomycota, classes Malasseziomycetes, Moniliel-lomycetes, Spiculogloeomycetes, Tritirachiomycetes and orders Amylocorticiales, Golubeviales, Holtermanniales, Jaapiales, Lepidostromatales, Robbauerales, Stereopsidales and Trichosporonales. However, the younger divergence times of Leucosporidiales (Microbotryomycetes) indicate that its order status is not supported, thus we propose combining it under Microbotryales. On the other hand, the families Buckleyzymaceae and Sakaguchiaceae (Cystoba-sidiomycetes) are raised to Buckleyzymales and Sakaguchiales due to their older divergence times. Cystofilobasidiales (Tremellomycetes) has an older divergence time and should be amended to a higher rank. We however, do not introduce it as new class here for Cystofilobasidiales, as DNA sequences from these taxa are not from their respective types and thus await further studies. Divergence times for Exobasidiomycetes, Cantharellales, Gomphales and Hysterangiales were obtained based on limited species sequences in molecular dating study. More comprehensive phylogenetic studies on those four taxa are needed in the future because our ML analysis based on wider sampling, shows they are not monophyletic groups. In general, the six-gene phylogenies are in agreement with the phyloproteomics tree except for the placements of Wallemiomycotina, orders Amylocorticiales, Auriculariales, Cantharellales, Geastrales, Sebacinales and Trechisporales from Agaricomycetes. These conflicting placements in the six-gene phylogeny vs the phyloproteomics tree are discussed. This leads to future perspectives for assessing gene orthology and problems in deciphering taxon ranks using divergence times.",2017,84,10.1007/s13225-017-0381-5

Phytoplankton cell size and shape are key traits under selection by environmental filters and species interactions. Spatial differences in resource availability shape species diversity according to their use efficiency. Niche partitioning promotes plankton diversity. Here, we explore how size and shape enter the diversity game. How does taxonomic and morpho-functional community structure vary at different spatial scales? What are the potential drivers shaping the structure of phytoplankton communities? We explore these questions by looking at the individual level variability in taxonomic and morphological traits in a biogeographical snapshot of natural phytoplankton communities in coastal ecosystems around the globe. We found that taxonomic variability is mainly concentrated at local and regional levels, whereas shape and size variability are mainly concentrated at a local level, despite the environmental heterogeneity of ecosystems. Species diversity was more variable than trait diversity from local to global spatial scales. We suggest that structural organization of phytoplankton communities in coastal ecosystems may follow a hierarchical pattern of trait organization, where a different combination of multiple functional traits may represent effective strategies and promote success under given environmental conditions as a resolution of Hutchinsons paradox.",2017,39,10.1093/plankt/fbx001

These phenotypic effects, combined with efficient vertical transmission from mothers to offspring, satisfactorily explain the invasion dynamics of Wolbachia within species. However, beyond the species level, the lack of congruence between the host and symbiont phylogenetic trees indicates that Wolbachia horizontal transfers and extinctions do happen and underlie its global distribution. But how often do they occur? And has the Wolbachia pandemic reached its equilibrium? Here, we address these questions by inferring recent acquisition/loss events from the distribution of Wolbachia lineages across the mitochondrial DNA tree of 3,600 arthropod specimens, spanning 1,100 species from Tahiti and surrounding islands. We show that most events occurred within the last million years, but are likely attributable to individual level variation (e.g., imperfect maternal transmission) rather than population level variation (e.g., Wolbachia extinction). At the population level, we estimate that mitochondria typically accumulate 4.7% substitutions per site during an infected episode, and 7.1% substitutions per site during the uninfected phase. Using a Bayesian time calibration of the mitochondrial tree, these numbers translate into infected and uninfected phases of approximately 7 and 9 million years. Infected species thus lose Wolbachia slightly more often than uninfected species acquire it, supporting the view that its present incidence, estimated here slightly below 0.5, represents an epidemiological equilibrium.",2017,34,10.1093/molbev/msx073

However. the description of functional microbial diversity occurring in these regions remains only partially documented. In this article, we use a numerical model, simulating a large number of phytoplankton phenotypes to explore the three-dimensional spatial patterns of phytoplankton abundance and diversity in the Iroise Sea (western Brittany). Our results suggest that, in boreal summer, a seasonally marked tidal front shapes the phytoplankton species richness. A diversity maximum is found in the surface mixed layer located slightly west of the tidal front (i.e., not strictly co-localized with high biomass concentrations) which separates tidally mixed from stratified waters. Differences in phenotypic composition between sub-regions with distinct hydrodynamic regimes (defined by vertical mixing, nutrients gradients and light penetration) are discussed. Local growth and/or physical transport of phytoplankton phenotypes are shown to explain our simulated diversity distribution. We find that a large fraction (64%) of phenotypes present during the considered period of September are ubiquitous, found in the frontal area and on both sides of the front (i.e., over the full simulated domain). The frontal area does not exhibit significant differences between its community composition and that of either the well-mixed region or an offshore Deep Chlorophyll Maximum (DCM). Only three phenotypes (out of 77) specifically grow locally and are found at substantial concentration only in the surface diversity maximum. Thus, this diversity maximum is composed of a combination of ubiquitous phenotypes with specific picoplankton deriving from offshore, stratified waters (including specific phenotypes from both the surface and the DCM) and imported through physical transport, completed by a few local phenotypes. These results are discussed in light of the three-dimensional general circulation at frontal interfaces.

"Nino-Garcia, JP; Ruiz-Gonzalez, C; del Giorgio, PA",Exploring the Ecological Coherence between the Spatial and Temporal Patterns of Bacterioplankton in Boreal Lakes,FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY,"One of the major contemporary challenges in microbial ecology has been to discriminate the reactive core from the random, unreactive components of bacterial communities. In previous work we used the spatial abundance distributions of bacterioplankton across boreal lakes of Quebec to group taxa into four distinct categories that reflect either hydrology-mediated dispersal along the aquatic network or environmental selection mechanisms within lakes. Here, we test whether this categorization derived from the spatial distribution of taxa is maintained over time, by analyzing the temporal dynamics of the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) within those spatially derived categories along an annual cycle in the oligotrophic lake Croche (Quebec, Canada), and assessing the coherence in the patterns of abundance, occurrence, and environmental range of these OTUs over space and time. We report that the temporal dynamics of most taxa within a single lake are largely coherent with those derived from their spatial distribution over large spatial scales, suggesting that these properties must be intrinsic of particular taxa. We also identified a set of rare taxa cataloged as having a random occupancy based on their spatial distribution, but which showed clear seasonality and abundance peaks along the year, yet these comprised a very small fraction of the total rare OTUs. We conclude that the presence of most rare bacterioplankton taxa in boreal lakes is random, since both their temporal and spatial dynamics suggest links to passive downstream transport and persistence in freshwater networks, rather than environmental selection.",2017,8,10.3389/fmicb.2017.00636

Although the roles of environmental heterogeneity and geographical distance in structuring soil microbial communities have been studied intensively, the effects of environmental and spatial variation on the species richness estimation have not been examined. To this end, we have explored their effects on estimating the belowground soil bacterial species richness within a 50 ha forest dynamic plot (FDP) using a published massive sequencing dataset with intensive sampling scheme. Our resampling analyses showed that, for a given sequencing depth, increasing the sample size could significantly enhance the detection of rare species by capturing more of the environmental and spatial variation, thus obtaining higher observed and estimated species richness. Additionally, the estimates of bacterial species richness were significantly and positively correlated with environmental variation among samples, indicating that environmental filtering was the main mechanism driving the processes of community assembly for belowground soil bacterial communities in the plot. Moreover, this effect of environmental variation could be markedly alleviated when the sample size was higher than 450, and thus we predicted that there were at least 42,866 soil bacterial species based on 8,296,878 sequences from 550 samples in the whole 50 ha FDP. Furthermore, we built a power law environmental heterogeneity equation (EHE) as a decision-tool to determine an approximate sample size for comprehensively capturing the environmental gradient within a given habitat. Collectively, this work further links the inherent environmental and spatial variation to the estimation of soil bacterial species richness within a given region, and provides a useful tool of sampling design for a better understanding of microbial biogeographic patterns and estimation of microbial biodiversity.",2017,8,10.3389/fmicb.2017.00690

We studied the potential influence of changing soil water balance on soil biota by comparing existing sites along a natural water balance gradient in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. In this study, the community structure of bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes differed between the different soil water conditions. Soil moisture was the strongest predictor of bacterial and eukaryotic community structure, whereas C/N ratio was the key factor predicting variation in the archaeal community. Bacterial and eukaryotic diversity was quite stable among different soil water availability, but archaeal diversity was dramatically different between the habitats. The auxotype of methanogens also varied significantly among different habitats. The covarying soil properties among habitats shaped the community structure of soil microbes, with archaea being particularly sensitive in terms of community composition, diversity and functional groups. Bacterial and archaeal phylogenetic community turnover was mainly driven by deterministic processes while stochastic processes had stronger effects on eukaryotic phylogenetic community turnover. Our work provides insight into microbial community, functional group and phylogenetic turnover under different soil conditions in low-latitude alpine ecosystem.",2017,7,10.1038/srep46407

Legumes (Fabaceae) are a diverse and widely distributed plant family largely dependent on symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing rhizobia, which are acquired from soil after germination. This dependency is predicted to limit establishment in new geographic areas, owing to a disruption of compatible host-symbiont associations. Here we compare non-native establishment patterns of symbiotic and non-symbiotic legumes across over 3,500 species, covering multiple independent gains and losses of rhizobial symbiosis. We find that symbiotic legume species have spread to fewer non-native regions compared to non-symbiotic legumes, providing strong support for the hypothesis that lack of suitable symbionts or environmental conditions required for effective nitrogen-fixation are driving these global introduction patterns. These results highlight the importance of mutualisms in predicting non-native species establishment and the potential impacts of microbial biogeography on global plant distributions.",2017,8,10.1038/ncomms14790

However there are still many remaining questions about these associations including what factors drive host-associated bacterial composition. To better understand the evolutionary significance of this association in nature, further studies addressing a diversity of hosts across locations and evolutionary history are necessary. Ants of the genus Polyrhachis (spiny ants) are distributed across the Old World and exhibit generalist diets and habits. Using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) and bioinformatics tools, this study explores the microbial community of >80 species of Polyrhachis distributed across the Old World and compares the microbiota of samples and related hosts across different biogeographic locations and in the context of their phylogenetic history. Results: The predominant bacteria across samples were Enterobacteriaceae (Blochmannia - with likely many new strains), followed by Wolbachia (with multiple strains), Lactobacillus, Thiotrichaceae, Acinetobacter, Nocardia, Sodalis, and others. We recovered some exclusive strains of Enterobacteriaceae as specific to some subgenera of Polyrhachis, corroborating the idea of coevolution between host and bacteria for this bacterial group. Our correlation results (partial mantel and mantel tests) found that host phylogeny can influence the overall bacterial community, but that geographic location had no effect. Conclusions: Our work is revealing important aspects of the biology of hosts in structuring the diversity and abundance of these host-associated bacterial communities including the role of host phylogeny and shared evolutionary history.",2017,17,10.1186/s12862-017-0945-8

In the present study, luminal and mucosal samples taken along the longitudinal axis of the rat digestive tract were subjected to 16S rRNA gene sequencing-based analysis to determine the baseline microbial composition. Results showed that the community diversity increased from the upper to lower GI segments and that the stratification of microbial communities as well as shift of microbial metabolites were driven by biogeographic location. A greater proportion of lactate-producing bacteria (such as Lactobacillus, Turicibacter and Streptococcus) were found in the stomach and small intestine, while anaerobic Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae, fermenting carbohydrates and plant aromatic compounds, constituted the bulk of the large-intestinal core microbiota where topologically distinct co-occurrence networks were constructed for the adjacent luminal and mucosal compartments. When comparing the GI microbiota from different hosts, we found that the rat microbial biogeography might represent a new reference, distinct from other murine animals.

"Zhao, F; Xu, KD",Distribution of Ciliates in Intertidal Sediments across Geographic Distances: A Molecular View,PROTIST,"The estimation of the diversity and geographic distribution of protists in particular ciliates has long been an ongoing debate. We estimated the distribution of ciliates in intertidal sediments with geographic distance ranging from 10 cm to 1,000 km, using high-throughput DNA sequencing. Higher community similarity, in particular that of rare ciliate taxa, occurred between replicates than between sites. Statistical analyses showed that the community dissimilarities of both abundant and moderately abundant ciliates had correlations with geographic distance at the scales of 50 m, 200 km and 1000 km, indicating a distance-decay relationship. No significant correlation was observed for rare taxa. The analysis of Bray-Curtis similarity showed a higher pairwise community similarity in abundant taxa than in moderately abundant taxa, and that in rare taxa was the lowest. Abundant taxa usually can disperse in a wider range than rare taxa, though their distribution is restricted by distance to some extent. Rare taxa are potentially more sensitive to changing environments, but no distance-decay relationship could be observed. The data indicate contrasting patterns of geographic distribution of the abundant and rare ciliate taxa and a weak distance-decay relationship for relatively abundant taxa at a scale over 50 m.

This study investigates the community composition of black smoker vent microorganisms in the Southern Hemisphere, and changes thereof along a spatial and chemical gradient ranging from the vent plume to surrounding waters. We sampled two hydrothermal vent fields, one at the South West Indian Ridge (SWIR), the other at the East Scotia Ridge (ESR). Samples were collected across vent fields at varying vertical distances from the origin of the plumes. The microbial data were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq platform for the 16SrRNA gene. A substantial amount of vent-specific putative chemosynthetic microorganisms were found, particularly in samples from focused hydrothermal venting. Common vent-specific organisms from both vent fields were the genera Arcobacter, Caminibacter and Sulfurimonas from the Epsilonproteobacteria and the SUP05 group from the Gammaproteobacteria. There were no major differences in microbial composition between SWIR and ESR for focused plume samples. However, within the ESR the diffuse flow and focused samples differed significantly in microbial community composition and relative abundance. For Epsilonproteobacteria, we found evidence of niche-specificity to hydrothermal vent environments. This taxon decreased in abundance by three orders of magnitude from the vent orifice to background water. Epsilonproteobacteria distribution followed a distance-decay relationship as vent-effluents mixed with the surrounding seawater. This study demonstrates strong habitat affinity of vent microorganisms on a metre scale with distinct environmental selection.",2017,4,10.1098/rsos.160829

The Sarno River, one of the most polluted rivers in Europe, strongly contributes to the pollution of the area, discharging high amounts of heavy metals and organic wastes from heavily cultivated and industrial areas. This paper reports on the diversity and community structure of the marine residential Bacteria and Archaea of the Gulf of Naples in an area close to the river Sarno plume and investigates their small-scale taxonomic diversity and expression patterns as a proxy of potential metabolic activity using metagenomics and metatranscriptomics. Bacteria and Archaea were mainly represented by marine clades, with only minor contributors from freshwater ones. The community was dominated by Alpha- and Gammaproteobacteria, of which Rhodospirillales, Pelagibacteriales, and Oceanospirilalles were most represented. However, Alteromonadales and Rhodobacterales were the most active, despite their relative lower abundance, suggesting that they are important for overall ecosystem functioning and nutrient cycling. Nitrification and a reversed form of dissimilatory sulfate reduction were the major metabolic processes found in the metatrascriptomes and were mainly associated to NitrosopuMilaleS and Pelagibacter, respectively. No clear indication of transcripts related to stress induced by heavy metals or organic pollutants was found. In general, despite the high loads of pollutants discharged continuously by the Sarno River, the microbial community did not show marks of stress-induced changes neither structural nor functional, thus suggesting that this river has little or no effect on the planktonic bacterial community of the Gulf of Naples.

In 2008, developmental chronosequences with ages ranging from 105 to 500,000 years across Georgia (GA) and Michigan (MI) were studied to investigate how bacterial community composition and diversity change as a result of local environmental gradients that develop during pedogenesis. Geographic factors were studied between and within locations spanning two scales: (1) regionally between 0.1 and 50 and (2) similar to 1700 km apart. The diversity was surveyed using high-throughput pyrosequencing, and variance partitioning was used to describe the effects of spatial, environmental, and spatio-environmental factors on bacterial community composition. At the local scale, variation in bacterial communities was most closely related to environmental factors (r(M)=0.59, p = 0.0001). There were differences in bacterial communities between the two locations, indicating spatial biogeography. Estimates of bacterial diversity were much greater in MI (numbers of OTU, ACE, and Chao1) and remained 2-3x greater in MI than GA after removing the effect of soil properties. The large differences in diversity between geographically separated bacterial communities in different climates need further investigation. It is not known if the rare members of the community, which contributed to greater bacterial diversity in GA relative to MI, play an important role in ecosystem function but has been hypothesized to play a role in ecosystem resiliency, resistance, and stability.

To address this obstacle, we investigated (a) biogeographical patterns in attached and waterborne microbiomes across three hydrologically-connected, physicochemically-distinct zones (inland hyporheic, nearshore hyporheic and river); (b) assembly processes that generated these patterns; (c) groups of organisms that corresponded to deterministic changes in the environment; and (d) correlations between these groups and hyporheic metabolism. All microbiomes remained dissimilar through time, but consistent presence of similar taxa suggested dispersal and/or common selective pressures among zones. Further, we demonstrated a pronounced impact of deterministic assembly in all microbiomes as well as seasonal shifts from heterotrophic to autotrophic microorganisms associated with increases in groundwater discharge. The abundance of one statistical cluster of organisms increased with active biomass and respiration, revealing organisms that may strongly influence hyporheic biogeochemistry. Based on our results, we propose a conceptualization of hyporheic zone metabolism in which increased organic carbon concentrations during surface water intrusion support heterotrophy, which succumbs to autotrophy under groundwater discharge. These results provide new opportunities to enhance microbially-explicit ecosystem models describing hyporheic zone biogeochemistry and its influence over riverine ecosystem function.",2017,19,10.1111/1462-2920.13720

This microdiversity, or closely related (> 97% similar 16S rRNA gene) but ecologically and physiologically distinct sub-taxonomic groups, appears to be an intrinsic property of microorganisms. However, the functional implications of microdiversity as well as its effects on microbial biogeography are poorly understood. Here, we present two theoretical models outlining the evolutionary mechanisms that drive the formation of microdiverse sub-taxa. Additionally, we review recent literature and reveal that microdiversity influences a wide range of functional traits across diverse ecosystems and microbes. Moving to higher levels of organization, we use laboratory data from marine, soil, and host-associated bacteria to demonstrate that the aggregated trait-based response of microdiverse sub-taxa modifies the fundamental niche of microbes. The correspondence between microdiversity and niche space represents a critical tool for future studies of microbial ecology. By combining growth experiments on diverse isolates with examinations of environmental abundance patterns, researchers can better quantify the fundamental and realized niches of microbes and improve understanding of microbial biogeography and response to future environmental change.",2017,9,10.1111/1758-2229.12523

This genetic variation was predominantly due to mutation rather than recombination. Phylogenetic analysis of the 11 concatenated genes showed a clear geographical isolation corresponding to the hydrothermal regions they originated from, suggesting limited dispersal. Genetic differentiation among Sulfurimonas populations was primarily influenced by geographical distance rather than gas composition of vent fluid or habitat, although in situ environmental conditions of each microhabitat could not be examined. Nevertheless, Sulfurimonas may possess a higher dispersal capability compared with deep-sea hydrothermal vent thermophiles.

The study section included portions of the Upper, Middle, and Lower Mississippi River, confluences with five tributaries draining distinct sub-basins, river cities, and extended stretches without major inputs to the Mississippi. The composition and proportional abundance of dominant bacterial phyla was distinct for free-living and particle associated cells, and constant along the entire reach, except for a substantial but transient disturbance near the city of Memphis, Tennessee. At a finer scale of taxonomic resolution (operational taxonomic units, OTUs), however, there were notable patterns in downriver variation in bacterial community alpha diversity (richness within a site) and beta diversity (variation in composition among sites). There was a strong and steady increase downriver in alpha diversity of OTUs on suspended particles, suggesting an increase in particle niche heterogeneity, and/or particle colonization. Relatively large shifts in beta diversity of free-living and particle-associated communities occurred following major tributary confluences and transiently at Memphis, while in long stretches between these points diversity typically varied more gradually. We conclude that the Mississippi River possesses a bacterioplankton microbiome distinct in diversity from other large river microbiomes in the Mississippi River Basin, that at major river confluences or urban point sources its OTU diversity may shift abruptly and substantially, presumably by immigration of distinct external microbiomes, but that where environmental conditions are more stable along the downriver gradient, micro biome diversity tends to vary gradually, presumably by a process of successional change in community composition.",2017,12,10.1371/journal.pone.0174890

As a result of numerous prior studies, we know that host genotypes and abiotic factors influence the composition of plant microbiomes. However, the high complexity of these communities challenges detailed studies to define experimentally the mechanisms underlying the dynamics of community assembly and the beneficial effects of such microbiomes on plant hosts. In this work, from the distinctive microbiota assembled by maize roots, through host-mediated selection, we obtained a greatly simplified synthetic bacterial community consisting of seven strains (Enterobacter cloacae, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Ochrobactrum pituitosum, Herbaspirillum frisingense, Pseudomonas putida, Curtobacterium pusillum, and Chryseobacterium indologenes) representing three of the four most dominant phyla found in maize roots. By using a selective culture-dependent method to track the abundance of each strain, we investigated the role that each plays in community assembly on roots of axenic maize seedlings. Only the removal of E. cloacae led to the complete loss of the community, and C. pusillum took over. This result suggests that E. cloacae plays the role of keystone species in this model ecosystem. In planta and in vitro, this model community inhibited the phytopathogenic fungus Fusarium verticillioides, indicating a clear benefit to the host. Thus, combined with the selective culture-dependent quantification method, our synthetic seven-species community representing the root microbiome has the potential to serve as a useful system to explore how bacterial interspecies interactions affect root microbiome assembly and to dissect the beneficial effects of the root microbiota on hosts under laboratory conditions in the future.",2017,114,10.1073/pnas.1616148114

Cell-cell communication might play an important role in modulating the physiologies of individual species, but evidence so far is limited. Results: Here we demonstrate that a pathogen of the oral cavity, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (A. act.), triggers expression of the quorum sensing (QS) regulon of Streptococcus mutans, a well-studied model organism for cariogenic streptococci, in dual-species biofilms grown on artificial saliva. The gene for the synthesis of the QS signal XIP is essential for this interaction. Transcriptome sequencing of biofilms revealed that S. mutans up-regulated the complete QS regulon (transformasome and mutacins) in the presence of A. act. and down-regulated oxidative stress related genes. A. act. required the presence of S. mutans for growth. Fimbriae and toxins were its most highly expressed genes and up-regulation of anaerobic metabolism, chaperones and iron acquisition genes was observed in co-culture. Metatranscriptomes from periodontal pockets showed highly variable levels of S. mutans and low levels of A. act.. Transcripts of the alternative sigma-factor SigX, the key regulator of QS in S. mutans, were significantly enriched in periodontal pockets compared to single cultures (log(2) 4.159, FDR <= 0.001, and expression of mutacin related genes and transformasome components could be detected. Conclusion: The data show that the complete QS regulon of S. mutans can be induced by an unrelated oral pathogen and S. mutans may be competent in oral biofilms in vivo.",2017,18,10.1186/s12864-017-3618-5

Seawater samples were prepared from seven different stations in the South Sea of Korea, the marginal sea in the western Pacific Ocean, and were divided into three groups according to distances from the coastline. The majority of 19,860 sequences were affiliated with Alphaproteobacteria (58.2%), Gammaproteobacteria (7.9%), and Bacteroidetes (13.9%). The bacterioplankton community at each station was highly diverse and varied among the samples. Major bacterial lineages showed different niche preferences among three locational groups. Alphaproteobacteria was the most abundant bacterial class, and it harbored the most frequently recorded operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in all sampling stations. However, dominant groups at the order levels showed a clear difference among the samples. The SAR11 clade was more abundant in coastal waters while the Roseobacter clade prevailed at stations far away from the coastline. Furthermore, members of Actinobacteria and Cyanobacteria also exhibited spatial variability. The OM1 clade in Actinobacteria constituted a predominant fraction in coastal samples, but it was essentially absent at the distal stations closer to open ocean. In contrast, Synechococcus was the predominant taxon in the distal samples, accounting for 7.1-19.5%, but was hardly detected in coastal waters, representing less than 0.7%. In Bacteroidetes, NS5 and NS9 groups tended to inhabit coastal waters while the genera Polaribacter and Ulvibacter were more abundant in distal stations. Clustering analysis and principle coordinates analysis based on OTU data indicated that bacterial communities in the studied area were separated into three groups that coincided with locational grouping. Statistical analysis showed that phosphate and dissolved oxygen concentration had a significant influence on the bacterial community composition.",2017,12,10.1371/journal.pone.0174159

In this study, we used a phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis to investigate the vertical distribution of the microbial community, and to identify the environmental factors that contributed to changes of the microbial community along a soil depth gradient. Samples were collected from the soil surface to 1 m in depth from three soil types of paddy fields in three regions. The results showed that total PLFAs and Shannons diversity index decreased significantly with increasing soil depth, and they exhibited relatively low values at soil depths less than 40 cm. In the paddy soil profile, the relative microbial abundance was in the order bacteria > actinomycetes > fungi. Generally, the relative abundances of bacteria and fungi significantly decreased at 0-40 cm depths and then increased at 40-100 cm depths; however, the relative abundance of actinomycetes usually increased at 0-40 cm depths, and then decreased significantly with increasing soil depth. The proportion of Gram-positive bacteria was higher than that of Gram-negative bacteria in deeper soils. Canonical correspondence analysis and Pearsons correlation analysis indicated that nutrient resources and soil water content were more closely correlated with the changes of the microbial community structures along the soil depth gradient than soil pH, elevation, and climate, and were the primary drivers of the microbial community composition along the soil depth gradient.

Their habitat are soda lakes which are dual extreme environments with a pH range from 9.5 to 11 and salt concentrations up to saturation. More than 100 strains of this genus have been isolated from various soda lakes all over the world, but only ten species have been effectively described yet. Therefore, the assignment of the remaining strains to either existing or novel species is important and will further elucidate their genomic diversity as well as give a better general understanding of this genus. Recently, the genomes of 76 Thioalkalivibrio strains were sequenced. On these, we applied different methods including (i) 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, (ii) Multilocus Sequence Analysis (MLSA) based on eight housekeeping genes, (iii) Average Nucleotide Identity based on BLAST (ANI(b)) and MUMmer (ANI(m)), (iv) Tetranucleotide frequency correlation coefficients (TETRA), (v) digital DNA: DNA hybridization (dDDH) as well as (vi) nucleotide-and amino acid-based Genome BLAST Distance Phylogeny (GBDP) analyses. We detected a high genomic diversity by revealing 15 new genomic species and 16 new genomic subspecies in addition to the ten already described species. Phylogenetic and phylogenomic analyses showed that the genus is not monophyletic, because four strains were clearly separated from the other Thioalkalivibrio by type strains from other genera. Therefore, it is recommended to classify the latter group as a novel genus. The biogeographic distribution of Thioalkalivibrio suggested that the different genomic species can be classified as candidate disjunct or candidate endemic species. This study is a detailed genome-based classification and identification of members within the genus Thioalkalivibrio. However, future phenotypical and chemotaxonomical studies will be needed for a full species description of this genus.",2017,12,10.1371/journal.pone.0173517

Unlike many other invertebrate hosts of chemosynthetic microbes, pliocardiin clams are found in every ocean in a variety of reducing habitats, including hydrothermal vents, cold seeps, organic falls and deep-sea fans. The global distribution of pliocardiin clams suggests historical gene flow between ocean basins. We focus on 3 pliocardiin genera Pliocardia I, Calyptogena and Abyssogena each of which has a pair of sister clades in the Atlantic and Pacific. Our work tests the hypothesis that historical gene flow between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans within these genera was interrupted by the closure of the Panamanian seaway and tests whether isolation between the ocean basins is the result of vicariance or past colonization. These questions are investigated in the context of fossil evidence, biogeography and phylogenetics. This study revealed a set of substitution rates consistent with other invertebrate studies (mu =0.8%/My/lineage), and a set consistent with much lower rates often attributed to deep-sea organisms (mu=0.3%/Myflineage). Among the Pacific/Atlantic sister pairs, Pilocardia I COI divergence per lineage is intermediate (2.5%), Calyptogena is the highest (6.1%) and Abyssogena the lowest (0.8%). The substitution rates suggest that Pliocardia I and Calyptogena have histories of at least 2.8 My in the Atlantic, with Calyptogena likely older. The slower rate, however, is inconsistent with both the maximum age of the family and several well studied fossils: leaving the faster rate preferred. With the faster rate, the Abyssogena southwardae Glade diverged from its Pacific sister Glade around 1 Mya, which likely post-dates the closure of the Isthmus of Panama and the opening of the Bering Strait. In light of this recent divergence, we test the previously proposed hypothesis that there is a high level of ongoing gene flow between Atlantic populations of A. southwardae. A. southwardae has colonized a broad geographic range of seep sites including the West Florida Escarpment, the Barbados Accretionary Prism, the Lobes of Congo, and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge north and south of the Romanche Transform Fault. Coalescent methods detect gene flow between Barbados and the Mid-Atlantic ridge; and between the West Florida Escarpment and the Lobes of Congo. All other comparisons failed to detect gene flow, contrary to prevailing interpretations of connectivity across the entire Atlantic Basin. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2017,137,

The distancedecay relationship is thought to be weak in habitats where dispersal is high, such as in the pelagic environment, where ocean currents facilitate microbial dispersal. Most studies of microbial community composition to date have observed little geographical heterogeneity on a regional scale (100 km). We present a study of microbial communities across a dynamic frontal zone in the southwest Indian Ocean and investigate the spatial structure of the microbes with respect to the different water masses separated by these fronts. We collected 153 samples of free-living microorganisms from five seamounts located along a gradient from subtropical to subantarctic waters and across three depth layers: (i) the sub-surface chlorophyll maximum (approx. 40 m), (ii) the bottom of the euphotic zone (approx. 200 m), and (iii) the benthic boundary layer (300-2000 m). Diversity and abundance of microbial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were assessed by amplification and sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene on an Illumina MiSeq platform. Multivariate analyses showed thatmicrobial communitieswere structured more strongly by depth than by latitude, with similar phyla occurring within each depth stratum across seamounts. The deep layer was homogeneous across the entire survey area, corresponding to the spread of Antarctic intermediate water. However, within both the sub-surface layer and the intermediate depth stratum there was evidence for OTU turnover across fronts. The microbiome of these layers appears to be divided into three distinct biological regimes corresponding to the subantarctic surface water, the convergence zone and subtropical. We show that microbial biogeography across depth and latitudinal gradients is linked to the water masses the microbes persist in, resulting in regional patterns of microbial biogeography that correspond to the regional scale physical oceanography.",2017,4,10.1098/rsos.170033
"Lester, PJ; Sebastien, A; Suarez, AV; Barbieri, RF; Gruber, MAM",Symbiotic bacterial communities in ants are modified by invasion pathway bottlenecks and alter host behavior,ECOLOGY,"Biological invasions are a threat to global biodiversity and provide unique -opportunities to study ecological processes. Population bottlenecks are a common feature of biological invasions and the severity of these bottlenecks is likely to be compounded as an invasive species spreads from initial invasion sites to additional locations. Despite extensive work on the genetic consequences of bottlenecks, we know little about how they influence microbial communities of the invaders themselves. Due to serial bottlenecks, invasive species may lose microbial symbionts including pathogenic taxa (the enemy release hypothesis) and/or may accumulate natural enemies with increasing time after invasion (the pathogen accumulation and invasive decline hypothesis). We tested these alternate hypotheses by surveying bacterial communities of Argentine ants (Linepithema humile). We found evidence for serial symbiont bottlenecks: the bacterial community richness declined over the invasion pathway from Argentina to New Zealand. The abundance of some genera, such as Lactobacillus, also significantly declined over the invasion pathway. Argentine ants from populations in the United States shared the most genera with ants from their native range in Argentina, while New Zealand shared the least (120 vs. 57, respectively). Nine genera were present in all sites around the globe possibly indicating a core group of obligate microbes. In accordance with the pathogen accumulation and invasive decline hypothesis, Argentine ants acquired genera unique to each specific invaded country. The United States had the most unique genera, though even within New Zealand these ants acquired symbionts. In addition to our biogeographic sampling, we administered antibiotics to Argentine ants to determine if changes in the micro--symbiont community could influence behavior and survival in interspecific interactions. Treatment with the antibiotics spectinomycin and kanamycin only slightly increased Argentine ant interspecific aggression, but this increase significantly decreased survival in interspecific interactions. The survival of the native ant species also decreased when the symbiotic microbial community within Argentine ants was modified by antibiotics. Our work offers support for both the enemy release hypothesis and that invasive species accumulate novel microbial taxa within their invaded range. These changes appear likely to influence invader behavior and survival.",2017,98,10.1002/ecy.1714

Conflicting spatial patterns observed across elevation gradients in soil bacterial community structure suggest that they are driven by various interacting factors at different spatial scales. Here, we investigated the relative impacts of non-resource (e. g. soil temperature, pH) and resource conditions (e. g. soil carbon and nitrogen) on the biogeography of soil bacterial communities across broad (i. e. along a 1500 m mountain elevation gradient) and fine sampling scales (i. e. along sunny and shady aspects of a mountain ridge). Our analysis of 16S rRNA gene data confirmed that when sampling across distances of < 1000 m, bacterial community composition was more closely related to the aspect of a site than its elevation. However, despite large differences in climate and resource-availability factors across elevation-and aspect-related gradients, bacterial community composition and richness were most strongly correlated with soil pH. These findings highlight the need to incorporate knowledge of multiple factors, including site aspect and soil pH for the appropriate use of elevation gradients as a proxy to explore the impacts of climate change on microbial community composition.",2017,93,10.1093/femsec/fiw253

In the present study, bacterial community structure was examined in epipelagic waters of a highly hydrodynamic area of the Southern Ocean to gain insight into the role that biogeochemical factors and water mass mixing (a proxy of dispersal) have on microbial biogeography. Four water masses that converge and mix around the South Shetland Islands (northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula) were investigated. Bacterioplankton communities were water-mass specific, and were best explained by dispersal rather than by biogeochemical factors, which is attributed to the relatively reduced environmental gradients found in these cold and nutrient rich waters. These results support the notionthat currents and water mixing may have a considerable effect in connecting and transforming different water bodies, and consequently, in shaping communities of microorganisms. Considering the multidimensional and dynamic nature of the ocean, analysis of water mass mixing is a more suitable approach to investigate the role of dispersal on the biogeography of planktonic microorganisms rather than geographical distance.",2017,19,10.1111/1462-2920.13538

Yet, empirical testing of metapopulation models on microbial communities is essentially lacking. We determined regional bacterioplankton dynamics from monthly transect sampling in the Baltic Sea Proper using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. A strong positive trend was found between local relative abundance and occupancy of populations. Notably, the occupancy-frequency distributions were significantly bimodal with a satellite mode of rare endemic populations and a core mode of abundant cosmopolitan populations (e.g. Synechococcus, SAR11 and SAR86 clade members). Temporal changes in population distributions supported several theoretical frameworks. Still, bimodality was found among bacterioplankton communities across the entire Baltic Sea, and was also frequent in globally distributed datasets. Datasets spanning waters with widely different physicochemical characteristics or environmental gradients typically lacked significant bimodal patterns. When such datasets were divided into subsets with coherent environmental conditions, bimodal patterns emerged, highlighting the importance of positive feedbacks between local abundance and occupancy within specific biomes. Thus, metapopulation theory applied to microbial biogeography can provide novel insights into the mechanisms governing shifts in biodiversity resulting from natural or anthropogenically induced changes in the environment.",2017,19,10.1111/1462-2920.13650

Recent research has shown that niche partitioning is critically involved in the assembly of Namib Desert edaphic communities. However, these studies have mainly focussed on the Domain Bacteria. Using microbial community fingerprinting, we compared the assembly of the bacterial, fungal and archaeal populations of microbial communities across nine soil niches from four Namib Desert soil habitats (riverbed, dune, gravel plain and salt pan). Permutational multivariate analysis of variance indicated that the nine soil niches presented significantly different physicochemistries (R-2 = 0.8306, P <= 0.0001) and that bacterial, fungal and archaeal populations were soil niche specific (R-2 >= 0.64, P <= 0.001).

However, the mechanisms underlying the assembly process of abundant and rare bacteria in plateau lakes are still poorly understood. In the present study, distribution of abundant and rare bacteria in 21 lakes on Yungui Plateau, China and the relative importance of deterministic and neutral factors to their biogeographic patterns were examined. Results surprisingly showed that similar biogeographic patterns of rare and abundant taxa were generally shaped via similar assembly mechanisms. For both bacterial groups, deterministic process strongly influenced the distribution, while neutral process was not at play. In addition, they both exhibited a weak distance-decay relationship. Nevertheless, environmental drivers of rare and abundant taxa and their importance were not exactly the same. Water physicochemical property was the most dominant driver shaping the biogeographic pattern of rare taxa, followed by lake morphology and watershed land-use, while for abundant taxa, watershed land-use was the most dominant driver and lake morphology did not play a significant role. This study suggested that rare bacteria in high-altitude aquatic ecosystems might experience equally low extinction risk and respond to environmental changes in a similar manner to abundant ones, but their ecological niches and functions were not identical.

Synechococcus sp. strain WH8102 is a motile Sargasso Sea isolate belonging to Clade III in subcluster 5.1. Non-flagellar motility in WH8102 depends upon two large cell surface proteins, SwmA and SwmB. In the marine plankton, Synechococcus can experience high rates of mortality from protist predators, suggesting strong selective pressure for the maintenance of anti-predation defenses. We used knockout mutants deficient in large cell surface proteins (SwmA- and SwmB-) to test the hypothesis that these proteins defend WH8102 against predation by ciliates and flagellates, important consumers of Synechococcus in aquatic ecosystems. Contrary to our hypothesis, we found that wild-type WH8102 were preyed upon at higher rates than SwmA- by ciliates and by two of three tested flagellate species. Thus the SwmA protein, constitutively produced by WH8102, made this strain more rather than less vulnerable to predation. SwmA proteins link to form the S layer, a cell coating known to promote adhesion in other microbial systems, suggesting the predation vulnerability arises from increased attachment between consumers and prey. Given the SwmA-related enhancement of predation rates, our findings suggest two possibilities for WH8102 and perhaps other Clade III Synechococcus: (1) factors other than protist predation select for production of the S layer; (2) ingestion actually increases fitness, by exposing digestion-resistant cells to beneficial conditions in the food vacuole.",2017,62,10.1002/lno.10460

Nonetheless, dynamics of bacterial fluxes between different terrestrial biomes and the atmosphere and their implications for terrestrial ecology are not well understood. This study examined how season and three different terrestrial biomes affect the abundance of culturable bacteria with three types of plant growth-promoting traits (PGPTs; phosphate-solubilization, siderophore-production, indoleacetic acid production) in the lower atmosphere. Air samples (180 L) were collected onto Petri dishes containing one of three different agar media for cultivating bacteria with the above-named PGPT in replicates of five above three distinct terrestrial biomes (aspen-forest, sagebrush-steppe, and suburban; Pocatello, ID, USA). Air was sampled once per week for three consecutive weeks during each of four seasons (autumn 2014 to summer 2015). Sequence libraries (16S rRNA gene) were also generated from air collected at each site during each sampling event. All three types of bacteria were present in the lower atmosphere above all terrestrial biomes during all seasons, but their abundance (P < 0.05) fluctuated with season, and the abundance of phosphate-solubilizers and siderophore-producers fluctuated with the interaction of biome and season (P < 0.05). Cultured bacteria with PGPTs represented 13 families; these families were also represented by 28.3-61.3 % of sequences in each of the 36-sequence libraries derived from air samples. Results of this first survey of airborne bacteria with PGPTs provide evidence that they may be ubiquitous in the lower atmosphere through which their transport to new habitats, particularly those in early successional stages, may impact ecosystem development.",2017,33,10.1007/s10453-016-9456-0

Further, previous studies focused mostly on species richness, while left understudied evenness, another important aspect of biodiversity. Here, we studied the elevational patterns in species richness and evenness of stream biofilm bacteria and diatoms in six mountains in Asia and Europe. We also reviewed published results for elevational richness patterns for soil and stream microbes in a literature analysis. Our results revealed that even within the same ecosystem type (that is, stream) or geographical region, bacteria and diatoms showed contrasting patterns in diversity. Stream microbes, including present stream data, tend to show significantly increasing or decreasing elevational patterns in richness, contrasting the findings for soil microbes that typically showed nonsignificant or significantly decreasing patterns. In all six mountains for bacteria and in four mountains for diatoms, species richness and evenness were positively correlated. The variation in bacteria and diatom richness and evenness were substantially explained by anthropogenic driven factors, such as total phosphorus (TP). However, diatom richness and evenness were also related to different main drivers as richness was mostly related to pH, while evenness was most explained by TP.

"Westcott, SL; Schloss, PD","OptiClust, an Improved Method for Assigning Amplicon-Based Sequence Data to Operational Taxonomic Units",MSPHERE,"Assignment of 16S rRNA gene sequences to operational taxonomic units (OTUs) is a computational bottleneck in the process of analyzing microbial communities. Although this has been an active area of research, it has been difficult to overcome the time and memory demands while improving the quality of the OTU assignments. Here, we developed a new OTU assignment algorithm that iteratively reassigns sequences to new OTUs to optimize the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), a measure of the quality of OTU assignments. To assess the new algorithm, OptiClust, we compared it to 10 other algorithms using 16S rRNA gene sequences from two simulated and four natural communities. Using the OptiClust algorithm, the MCC values averaged 15.2 and 16.5% higher than the OTUs generated when we used the average neighbor and distance-based greedy clustering with VSEARCH, respectively. Furthermore, on average, OptiClust was 94.6 times faster than the average neighbor algorithm and just as fast as distance-based greedy clustering with VSEARCH. An empirical analysis of the efficiency of the algorithms showed that the time and memory required to perform the algorithm scaled quadratically with the number of unique sequences in the data set. The significant improvement in the quality of the OTU assignments over previously existing methods will significantly enhance downstream analysis by limiting the splitting of similar sequences into separate OTUs and merging of dissimilar sequences into the same OTU. The development of the OptiClust algorithm represents a significant advance that is likely to have numerous other applications. IMPORTANCE The analysis of microbial communities from diverse environments using 16S rRNA gene sequencing has expanded our knowledge of the biogeography of microorganisms. An important step in this analysis is the assignment of sequences into taxonomic groups based on their similarity to sequences in a database or based on their similarity to each other, irrespective of a database. In this study, we present a new algorithm for the latter approach. The algorithm, OptiClust, seeks to optimize a metric of assignment quality by shuffling sequences between taxonomic groups. We found that OptiClust produces more robust assignments and does so in a rapid and memory-efficient manner. This advance will allow for a more robust analysis of microbial communities and the factors that shape them.",2017,2,10.1128/mSphereDirect.00073-17

Analyzing a single niche to categorize individuals does not enable researchers to comprehensively study the spatial variations of the microbiota. Therefore, characterizing the spatial community structures of the inflammatory bowel disease microbiome is critical for advancing our understanding of the inflammatory landscape of IBD. However, at present there is no universally accepted consensus regarding the use of specific sampling strategies in different biogeographic locations. In this review, we discuss the spatial distribution when screening sample collections in IBD microbiota research. Here, we propose a novel model, a three-dimensional spatial community structure, which encompasses the x-, y-, and z-axis distributions; it can be used in some sampling sites, such as feces, colonoscopic biopsy, the mucus gel layer, and oral cavity. On the basis of this spatial model, this article also summarizes various sampling and processing strategies prior to and after DNA extraction and recommends guidelines for practical application in future research.",2017,7,10.3389/fcimb.2017.00051

Despite their potential significance, the study of freshwater AAPs is in its infancy and limited to local investigations. Here, we explore the occurrence, diversity and distribution of AAPs in lakes covering a wide latitudinal gradient: Mongolian and German lakes located in temperate regions of Eurasia, tropical Great East African lakes, and polar permanently ice-covered Antarctic lakes. Our results show a widespread distribution of AAPs in lakes with contrasting environmental conditions and confirm that this group is composed of different members of the Alpha- and Betaproteobacteria. While latitude does not seem to strongly influence AAP abundance, clear patterns of community structure and composition along geographic regions were observed as indicated by a strong macro-geographical signal in the taxonomical composition of AAPs. Overall, our results suggest that the distribution patterns of freshwater AAPs are likely driven by a combination of small-scale environmental conditions (specific of each lake and region) and large-scale geographic factors (climatic regions across a latitudinal gradient).",2017,8,10.3389/fmicb.2017.00175

However, an accurate prediction is often very difficult not only because there are various types of food and contaminants, but also because the relationship between the diseases and the contaminants is highly complex and probabilistic. In this study, we use the deep denoising autoencoder (DDAE) to model the effect of food contamination on gastrointestinal infections, and thus provide a valuable tool for morbidity prediction. For effectively training the model with high-dimensional input data, we propose an evolutionary learning algorithm based on ecogeography-based optimization (EBO) in order to avoid premature convergence. Experimental results show that our evolutionary deep learning model obtains a much higher prediction accuracy than the shallow artificial neural network (ANN) model and the DDAE with other learning algorithms on a real-world dataset.",2017,226,10.1016/j.neucom.2016.11.018

These metabolites may defend the host sponge from potential predators. Variability in symbiont communities across the range of the host sponge could alter levels of chemical defense. To investigate the relationship between symbiont composition and chemical defense, the microbiomes and palatability of tissue samples from Ircinia campana were characterized from 5 sites along a latitudinal gradient spanning temperate (South Atlantic Bight, SAB) and tropical (Caribbean) regions. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and Illumina sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA genes revealed that I. campana from different locations contained significantly distinct microbiomes and exhibited a consistent relationship of lower symbiont similarity over greater geographic distance (i.e. distance-decay). However, crude organic extracts of all samples of I. campana were unpalatable to assay fish Thalassoma bifasciatum in laboratory assays, indicating no difference in chemical defense across locations. Distinct haplotypes of I. campana were detected in populations from the SAB and Caribbean, correlating with the observed patterns of latitudinal variation in microbial symbiont communities. Our findings indicate that I. campana is chemically defended from fish predators across the range of the species and that latitudinal variation occurs in the microbiome of I. campana, driven by a combination of host-specific factors and region-specific environmental filtering of symbiont communities.",2017,565,10.3354/meps12015

This approach revealed ecological and spatial-temporal variations in bacterioplankton community composition along the longitudinal axis. The community was dynamic and dominated by Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria phyla, encompassing 39.26% and 37.14% of all sequences, respectively, followed by Bacteroidetes (8.67%) and Cyanobacteria (3.90%).

These dormant populations of endospores are believed to accumulate in the seabed via passive dispersal by ocean currents followed by sedimentation from the water column. However, the magnitude of this process is poorly understood because the endospores present in seawater were so far not identified, and only the abundance of thermophilic sulfate-reducing endospores in the seabed has been quantified. We investigated the distribution of thermophilic fermentative endospores (TFEs) in water column and sediment of Aarhus Bay, Denmark, to test the role of suspended dispersal and determine the rate of endospore deposition and the endospore abundance in the sediment. We furthermore aimed to determine the time course of reactivation of the germinating TFEs. TFEs were induced to germinate and grow by incubating pasteurized sediment and water samples anaerobically at 50 degrees C. We observed a sudden release of the endospore component dipicolinic acid immediately upon incubation suggesting fast endospore reactivation in response to heating. Volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and H-2 began to accumulate exponentially after 3.5 h of incubation showing that reactivation was followed by a short phase of outgrowth before germinated cells began to divide. Thermophilic fermenters were mainly present in the sediment as endospores because the rate of VFA accumulation was identical in pasteurized and non-pasteurized samples. Germinating TFEs were identified taxonomically by reverse transcription, PCR amplification and sequencing of 16S rRNA. The water column and sediment shared the same phylotypes, thereby confirming the potential for seawater dispersal. The abundance of TFEs was estimated by most probable number enumeration, rates of VFA production, and released amounts of dipicolinic acid during germination. The surface sediment contained similar to 105-106 inducible TFEs cm(-3). TFEs thus outnumber thermophilic sulfate-reducing endospores by an order of magnitude. The abundance of cultivable TFEs decreased exponentially with sediment depth with a half-life of 350 years. We estimate that 6 X 109 anaerobic thermophilic endospores are deposited on the seafloor per m2 per year in Aarhus Bay, and that these thermophiles represent >10% of the total endospore community in the surface sediment.",2017,8,10.3389/fmicb.2017.00131

Despite substantial environmental differences, bacterial phyla were represented in similar proportions, with Acidobacteria and Proteobacteria the dominant phyla in all forests except one mangrove forest in Sarawak, although highly significant heterogeneity in frequency of individual phyla was detected among forests. In contrast, species diversity (alpha-diversity) differed to a much greater extent, being nearly six-fold higher in the mangrove forest (Chao index = 6,862) than in forests in Singapore and Sarawak (similar to 1,250). In addition, natural mixed dipterocarp forests had lower species diversity than acacia and oil palm plantations, indicating that aboveground tree composition does not influence soil bacterial diversity. Shannon and Chaol indices were correlated positively, implying that skewed operational taxonomic unit (OTU) distribution was associated with the abundance of overall and rare (singleton) OTUs. No OTUs were represented in all 28 forests, and forest -specific OTUs accounted for over 70% of all detected OTUs. Forests that were geographically adjacent and/or of the same forest type had similar bacterial species composition, and a positive correlation was detected between species divergence (beta-diversity) and direct distance between forests. Both alpha- and beta-diversities were correlated with soil pH. These results suggest that soil bacterial communities in different forests evolve largely independently of each other and that soil bacterial communities adapt to their local environment, modulated by bacterial dispersal (distance effect) and forest type. Therefore, we conclude that the biogeography of soil bacteria communities described here is non-random, reflecting the influences of contemporary environmental factors and evolutionary history.",2017,92,10.1266/ggs.16-00013

Leveraging the close proximity of forest, field and agricultural plots at the rare Charitable Research Reserve, we examined soil thaumarchaeotal biogeography at three different depths (0-15, 15-30 and 30-45 cm) from plots within areas of contrasting land usage. Data from high-throughput sequencing of thaumarchaeotal 16S rRNA gene sequences demonstrated that OTU richness was affected significantly by depth and land-use type. Specifically, thaumarchaeotal diversity was higher in soils from forest sites than from field sites, and lower within 0-15 cm soils than either 15-30 cm or 30-45 cm soils. Soil land-use type influenced the relative abundance of the Soil Crenarchaeota Group (SCG), with a lower relative abundance of SCG in forest sites compared to field sites. At the OTU level, thaumarchaeotal communities changed with increasing soil depth for agricultural soils, in contrast to homogeneous depth profiles generated from forest site samples. Soil pH was the strongest factor impacting thaumarchaeotal community composition and, importantly, the evenness of archaeal taxa.

A next-generation sequencing, phylogeographic analysis",MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION,"This work set out to shed light on the phylogeography of the SAR11 Glade of Alphaproteobacteria, which is probably the most abundant group of heterotrophic bacteria on Earth. In particular, we assessed the degree to which empirical evidence (environmental DNA sequences) supports the concept that SAR11 lineages evolve faster than they are dispersed thus generating vicariant distributions, as predicted by recent simulation efforts. We generated 16S rRNA gene sequences from surface seawater collected at the South West Atlantic Ocean and combined these data with previously published sequences from similar environments from elsewhere. Altogether, these data consisted in about 1e6 reads, from which we generated 355,306 high quality sequences of which 95,318 corresponded to SAR11. Quantitative phylogeographic analyses supported the existence of a spatially explicit distribution of SAR11 species and provided evidence in favor of the idea that dispersal limitations significantly contribute to SAR11 radiation throughout the worlds oceans. Likewise, pairwise phylogenetic distances between the communities studied here were significantly correlated with the genetic divergences predicted by a previously proposed neutral model. As discussed in the paper, these findings are compatible with the concept that the ocean surface constitutes a homogeneous environment for SAR11, in agreement with previous experimental data. We discuss the implications of this hypothesis in a global change scenario.

Yet, in many ways, microbes are more appropriate for testing this and other ecological theories due to their small size and short generation times that translate to an ease of replication. We used a natural experimental system of isolated host islands to test the generality of the theory of island biogeography. Specifically, we tested whether ectomycorrhizal fungal (EMF) richness increased with tree size and decreased with distance from forest in a subalpine basin in Yosemite National Park for two congeneric pine species, Pinus albicaulis and Pinus contorta. We determined EMF richness with next-generation sequencing, measured the size and age of each tree island (n = 40), and calculated geographic distances from each tree to the nearest forest edge. We found that EMF richness increased with island size (as measured by tree volume) and tree age for both pine species and decreased with distance from forest edge for P. albicaulis. Thus, we show the applicability of the theory to microbial symbionts in harsh, dry, and likely non-equilibrium systems. In addition, we found that despite the fact that our tree islands had a mean age of 65 yr, a pioneer community of EMF dominated. We interpret this as evidence that water stress interacts with succession to create a sustained period of early-stage fungi even in mature trees.",2017,8,10.1002/ecs2.1677

Oenococcus oeni is the main bacterial species involved in wine and cider making. It develops after the yeast-driven alcoholic fermentation and performs the malolactic fermentation, which improves the taste and aromatic complexity of most wines. Here, we have evaluated the diversity and specificity of O. oeni strains in six regions. A total of 235 wines and ciders were collected during spontaneous malolactic fermentations and used to isolate 3,212 bacterial colonies. They were typed by multilocus variable analysis, which disclosed a total of 514 O. oeni strains. Their phylogenetic relationships were evaluated by a second typing method based on single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis. Taken together, the results indicate that each region holds a high diversity of strains that constitute a unique population. However, strains present in each region belong to diverse phylogenetic groups, and the same groups can be detected in different regions, indicating that strains are not genetically adapted to regions. In contrast, greater strain identity was seen for cider, white wine, or red wine of Burgundy, suggesting that genetic adaptation to these products occurred. IMPORTANCE This study reports the isolation, genotyping, and geographic distribution analysis of the largest collection of O. oeni strains performed to date. It reveals that there is very high diversity of strains in each region, the majority of them being detected in a single region. The study also reports the development of an SNP genotyping method that is useful for analyzing the distribution of O. oeni phylogroups. The results show that strains are not genetically adapted to regions but to specific types of wines. They reveal new phylogroups of strains, particularly two phylogroups associated with white wines and red wines of Burgundy. Taken together, the results shed light on the diversity and specificity of wild strains of O. oeni, which is crucial for understanding their real contribution to the unique properties of wines.",2017,83,10.1128/AEM.02322-16

In addition, eucalyptus plantations (EP), used as shelter forests, were planted to protect the rubber plantations from typhoon hazards in the 1980s. To date, few studies have examined the effects on bacterial composition and diversity after secondary tropical forests (SF) have been converted into RP or EP. This study investigated the bacterial communities of RP, EP, and SF using an Illumina high-throughput sequencing analysis. Our findings revealed the following First, there were significant differences between RP, EP, and SF in bacterial compositions at both the phylum and family levels. Second, the Shannon indices of RP and EP were significantly higher than that of SF. The Simpson dominance index of SF was 0.012, which was significantly higher than those of RP and EP, indicating that the diversities of RP and EP were higher than that of SF. Abundance rank curves confirmed that the taxonomic compositions in EP and RP were relatively uniformly distributed compared with that in SF, which results in the higher diversities of RP and EP. Third, Soil nutrition (total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and total potassium), which explained 43.05% of the total variance of taxonomic composition, was the most important factor affecting the soil bacterial community structure in this region. In conclusion, soil nutrition has increased, mainly due to the application of fertilizers, after SF conversion to RP and EP, which, in turn, has resulted in significant changes in the bacterial community composition as well as a general increase in bacterial community diversity.",2017,63,10.5849/forsci.16-012

Pelagic ecosystems above the summits and flanks of seamounts have been observed to show different biological or biogeochemical properties to off-seamount areas, such as enhanced chlorophyll concentrations, a phenomenon referred to as the seamount effect. In addition, seamount biogeography has been hypothesised to be similar to islands where community structure differences in multiple organisms have been shown to change between seamounts and across frontal systems. We used elemental analysis, to measure particulate organic carbon (POC), and flow cytometry, to estimate abundance of microorganisms from above four seamounts (Coral, Melville, Middle of What and Atlantis) along the Southwest Indian Ridge (SWIR) from latitude 32.6 degrees S to 41.3 degrees S, longitude 57.1 degrees E to 42.7 degrees E. Samples were collected from the surface to the bottom using a CTD fitted with optical sensors. POC was predicted from models created from in-situ transmission (optical) data (c(p)). The high resolution predicted POC in the euphotic zone showed a heterogeneous distribution both above individual and between seamounts. The shallow penetration of two of the seamounts displayed an effect on the POC concentration in the euphotic zone depleting the layer around the summit. The transmission data showed higher concentrations of particles towards the surface, caused by primary production, and near to the seabed, probably resulting from re-suspension of sediments. The POC concentrations and microbial abundance were positively correlated to c(p) and fluctuated with particle abundance, with microorganisms accounting for similar to 50% of the observed POC. Based on non-metric multidimensional scaling it is clear that the microbial clusters strongly indicate three separate biological regimes associated with northeastern, central and southwestern zones of the section of the SWIR that was sampled. This biological zonation is associated with physical oceanographic boundaries represented by the Subtropical and Subantarctic Fronts, forming three distinct biogeographical regions.

Although bacterial communities were strongly influenced by depth across all sites, the magnitude of this influence was variable and demonstrated that land-use attributes also played a significant role in shaping soil bacterial communities. Soil pH exhibited a large gradient across samples and strongly influenced shifts in bacterial communities with depth and across different land-use systems, especially considering that physicochemical conditions showed generally consistent trends with depth. We observed significant (p <= 0.001) and strongly correlated taxa with depth and pH, with a strong predominance of positively depth-correlated OTUs without cultured representatives.

We test fundamental hypotheses of macroecological theories, showing that both taxonomic and functional classifications have distinct biogeographical variation across distance and environments depending on trophic composition. LocationStudies spanning the global oceans. MethodsTaxonomic and functional profiles were obtained from metagenomes and were compared across oceanographic regions and tested for patterns of co-occurrence. The influences of sampling method (filter size), environmental variables and geographical distribution were compared with distance-based linear models to test predictors of taxonomic and functional composition. Macroecological drivers were compared with bacterial community structure to test four biogeographical hypotheses: (1) no biogeographical patterns, (2) community structure reflects environmental dissimilarity, (3) community structure reflects distance, (4) community structure reflects environment and distance. ResultsBacterial families were clustered into four trophic groups - phototrophic, oligotrophic, eutrophic and copiotrophic - by changes in abundance across oceanographic regions and co-occurrence with core functions. Changes in community composition were best modelled by longitude for free-living communities and dissolved oxygen for mixed communities of free-living and particle-associated bacteria. Both microhabitat and community assignment had an impact on biogeographical patterns, with taxonomic compositions following our hypotheses 2 and 4 and functional gene compositions following hypotheses 3 and 4. Main conclusionsWe described four trophic groups adding to the current dichotomy of the classification of marine bacteria as oligotrophic or copiotrophic. Taxonomic composition of mixed communities reflected environmental differences but not geographical distance, whereas functional gene composition in free-living communities was independent of environmental dissimilarity and reflected geographical distance. Patterns of biogeography in bacterial communities differed depending on the description of taxa or function.

Here, we present a phylogeographic study of Oithona similis s.l. populations from the Arctic Ocean, the Southern Ocean and its northern boundaries, the North Atlantic and the Mediterrranean Sea. O. similis s.l. is considered as one of the most abundant species in temperate to polar oceans and acts as an important link in the trophic network between the microbial loop and higher trophic levels such as fish larvae. Two gene fragments were analysed: the mitochondria] cytochrome oxidase c subunit I (COI), and the nuclear ribosomal 28 S genetic marker. Seven distinct, geographically delimitated, mitochondria] lineages could be identified, with divergences among the lineages ranging from 8 to 24%, thus representing most likely cryptic or pseudocryptic species within O. similis s.l. Four lineages were identified within or close to the borders of the Southern Ocean, one lineage in the Arctic Ocean and two lineages in the temperate Northern hemisphere. Surprisingly the Arctic lineage was more closely related to lineages from the Southern hemisphere than to the other lineages from the Northern hemisphere, suggesting that geographic proximity is a rather poor predictor of how closely related the clades are on a genetic level.

The spatial distribution of bacterial community composition was examined by 16S rRNA gene using Illumina high-throughput sequencing in conjunction with sediment geophysicochemical variables and sampling geographical distance. Overall, Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Planctomycetes, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, Gemmatimonadetes, Bacteroidetes, Verrucomicrobia, Nitrospira and Thermomicrobia were the top ten dominant phyla. The bacterial communities from the same region exhibited similar composition pattern, but distinctive in each region. Statistical analysis (linear discriminant analysis effect size) showed Deltaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria were the distinct taxa in Chukchi Shelf, Slopes and Canadian Basin, respectively. Correspondingly, Desulfobacterales, Planctomycetales and Rhodospirillales were determined at order level. Canonical correspondence analysis demonstrated bacterial distribution was significantly correlated with sediment geophysicochemical factors and geographical distance. Furthermore, variance partitioning analysis confirmed that the combination of geophysicochemical factors, including sediment nutrients content, grain size, sampling site water depth and ice coverage, contributed more than geographical distance to the spatial distribution of bacterial communities across the western Arctic Ocean.

Growth and gene expression analysis of the vitamin B-12-requiring version of the methionine synthase enzyme, METH, and the B-1-independent version, METE, demonstrate that it is the presence of the METE gene which allows Fragilariopsis cylindrus to grow in the absence of B-12. Pseudo-nitzschia granifs lack of a functional METE gene means that it cannot survive without the vitamin. Through phylogenetic analysis, we further substantiate a lack of obvious grouping in METE presence among diatom clades. In addition, we also show how this trend may have a biogeographical basis, particularly in regions such as the Southern Ocean where B-12 concentrations may be consistently low. Our findings demonstrate the important role vitamins can play in diatom community dynamics within areas where vitamin supply may be variable and limiting. (C)2016 Elsevier GmbH.

Agriculture is a promising area for this exploration as soils harbor vast and diverse microbial communities. A better understanding of the drivers influencing microbial biogeographical patterns is necessary to properly exploit this resource. Here, we aimed to describe biogeographical patterns of bacterial communities across a broad spatial scale by sampling soils in 10 distinct farms (a total of 285 soil samples) located at the most important region for sugarcane production in Brazil. Bacterial communities were analyzed in terms of community structure and composition and further correlated with soil characteristics, agricultural practices and geographical distances. Distance decay patterns were found either at the bacterial community level (as determined by T-RFLP and sequencing analyses) and at the distribution of most bacterial phyla. Partial redundancy analysis revealed that soil characteristics (i.e., pH, granulometry, potassium and phosphorus contents) and agricultural practices (i.e., amendments of vinasse, charcoal and mechanical harvesting) explained the differential structuring of bacterial communities to a higher extend than did geographical distance. The co-occurrence/mutual-exclusion analysis suggested a role of biological connections in these assemblages, such as the co-occurrence of Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria, both negatively correlated with Actinobacteria. Our data constitute the broadest assessment of biogeographical patterns of bacterial communities across agricultural soils. Collectively, it indicates that these bacterial assemblages are suitable for management, what support the development of microbiome-based strategies in agricultural settings. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we compile evidence from three independent surveys in Hungary and Switzerland. First, we measured the weight and maturity of 2,656 T. aestivum fruit bodies from a three-day harvest in August 2014 in a highly productive orchard in Hungary. All specimens ranging between 2 and 755 g were almost evenly distributed through five maturation classes. Then, we measured the weight and maturity of another 4,795 T. aestivum fruit bodies harvested on four occasions between June and October 2015 in the same truffiere. Again, different maturation stages occurred at varying fruit body size and during the entire fruiting season. Finally, the predominantly unrelated weight and maturity of 81 T. aestivum fruit bodies from four fruiting seasons between 2010 and 2013 in Switzerland confirmed the Hungarian results. The spatiotemporal coexistence of 7,532 small-ripe and large-unripe T. aestivum, which accumulate to similar to 182 kg, differs from species-specific associations between the size and ripeness that have been reported for other mushrooms. Although size-independent truffle maturation stages may possibly relate to the perpetual belowground environment, the role of mycelial connectivity, soil property, microclimatology, as well as other abiotic factors and a combination thereof, is still unclear. Despite its massive sample size and proof of concept, this study, together with existing literature, suggests consideration of a wider ecological and biogeographical range, as well as the complex symbiotic fungus-host interaction, to further illuminate the hidden development of belowground truffle fruit bodies.",2017,12,10.1371/journal.pone.0170375

However, the fragmented spatial distribution and small area poses challenges for the dispersal of their microbial and faunal communities. Our study focused on the temporal dynamics and spatial distributions of sunken wood bacterial communities, which were deployed in the vicinity of different cold seeps in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Norwegian deep-seas. By combining fingerprinting of bacterial communities by ARISA and 454 sequencing with in situ and ex situ biogeochemical measurements, we show that sunken wood logs have a locally confined long-term impact (> 3y) on the sediment geochemistry and community structure. We confirm previous hypotheses of different successional stages in wood degradation including a sulphophilic one, attracting chemosynthetic fauna from nearby seep systems. Wood experiments deployed at similar water depths (1100-1700 m), but in hydrographically different oceanic regions harbored different wood-boring bivalves, opportunistic faunal communities, and chemosynthetic species. Similarly, bacterial communities on sunken wood logs were more similar within one geographic region than between different seas. Diverse sulphate-reducing bacteria of the Deltaproteobacteria, the sulphide-oxidizing bacteria Sulfurovum as well as members of the Acidimicrobiia and Bacteroidia dominated the wood falls in the Eastern Mediterranean, while Alphaproteobacteria and Flavobacteriia colonized the Norwegian Sea wood logs. Fauna and bacterial wood-associated communities changed between 1 to 3 years of immersion, with sulphate-reducers and sulphide -oxidizers increasing in proportion, and putative cellulose degraders decreasing with time. Only 6% of all bacterial genera, comprising the core community, were found at any time on the Eastern Mediterranean sunken wooden logs. This study suggests that biogeography and succession play an important role for the composition of bacteria and fauna of wood-associated communities, and that wood can act as stepping-stones for seep biota.",2017,12,10.1371/journal.pone.0169906

However, key questions related to what drives plant bacteriomes remain unanswered, among which is the impact of climate zones on plant-associated microbiota. This is particularly true for wild plants in arcto-alpine biomes. Here, we hypothesized that the bacterial communities associated with pioneer plants in these regions have major roles in plant health support, and this is reflected in the formation of climate and host plant specific endophytic communities. We thus compared the bacteriomes associated with the native perennial plants Oxyria digyna and Saxifraga oppositifolia in three arcto-alpine regions (alpine, low Arctic and high Arctic) with those in the corresponding bulk soils. As expected, the bulk soil bacterial communities in the three regions were significantly different. The relative abundances of Proteobacteria decreased progressively from the alpine to the high-arctic soils, whereas those of Actinobacteria increased. The candidate division AD3 and Acidobacteria abounded in the low Arctic soils. Furthermore, plant species and geographic region were the major determinants of the structures of the endophere communities. The plants in the alpine region had higher relative abundances of Proteobacteria, while plants from the low- and high-arctic regions were dominated by Firmicutes. A highly-conserved shared set of ubiquitous bacterial taxa (core bacteriome) was found to occur in the two plant species. Burkholderiales, Actinomycetales and Rhizobiales were the main taxa in this core, and they were also the main contributors to the differences in the endosphere bacterial community structures across compartments as well as regions. We postulate that the composition of this core is driven by selection by the two plants.",2017,8,10.3389/fmicb.2017.00012

Fifty-seven grape samples belonging to the Vitis vinifera grapevine cultivars Verdelho dos Acores (Verdelho), Arinto da Terceira (Arinto) and Terrantez do Pico (Terrantez) were collected in two consecutive years and 40 spontaneous fermentations were achieved. A total of 1710 yeast isolates were obtained from freshly crushed grapes and 1200 from final stage of fermentations. Twenty-eight species were identified, Hanseniaspura uvarum, Pichia terricola and Metschnikowia pulcherrima being the three most representative species isolated. Candida carpophila was encountered for the first time as an inhabitant of grape or wine-associated environments. In both sampling years, a higher proportion of H. uvarum in fresh grapes from Verdelho cultivar was observed, in comparison with Arinto cultivar. Qualitatively significant differences were found among yeast communities from several locations on five islands of the Archipelago, particularly in locations with distinctive agro-ecological compositions. Our results are in agreement with the statement that grape-associated microbial biogeography is non-randomly associated with interactions of climate, soil, cultivar, and vine training systems in vineyard ecosystems. Our observations strongly support a possible linkage between grape yeast and wine typicality, reinforcing the statement that different viti-cultural terroirs harbor distinctive yeast biota, in particular in vineyards with very distinctive environmental conditions.",2017,12,10.1371/journal.pone.0169883
"Hermans, SM; Buckley, HL; Case, BS; Curran-Cournane, F; Taylor, M; Lear, G",Bacteria as Emerging Indicators of Soil Condition,APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY,"Bacterial communities are important for the health and productivity of soil ecosystems and have great potential as novel indicators of environmental per-turbations. To assess how they are affected by anthropogenic activity and to determine their ability to provide alternative metrics of environmental health, we sought to define which soil variables bacteria respond to across multiple soil types and land uses. We determined, through 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, the composition of bacterial communities in soil samples from 110 natural or human-impacted sites, located up to 300 km apart. Overall, soil bacterial communities varied more in response to changing soil environments than in response to changes in climate or increasing geographic distance. We identified strong correlations between the relative abundances of members of Pirellulaceae and soil pH, members of Gaiellaceae and carbon-to-nitrogen ratios, members of Bradyrhizobium and the levels of Olsen P (a measure of plant available phosphorus), and members of Chitinophagaceae and aluminum concentrations. These relationships between specific soil attributes and individual soil taxa not only highlight ecological characteristics of these organisms but also demonstrate the ability of key bacterial taxonomic groups to reflect the impact of specific anthropogenic activities, even in comparisons of samples across large geographic areas and diverse soil types. Overall, we provide strong evidence that there is scope to use relative taxon abundances as biological indicators of soil condition. IMPORTANCE The impact of land use change and management on soil microbial community composition remains poorly understood. Therefore, we explored the relationship between a wide range of soil factors and soil bacterial community composition. We included variables related to anthropogenic activity and collected samples across a large spatial scale to interrogate the complex relationships between various bacterial community attributes and soil condition. We provide evidence of strong relationships between individual taxa and specific soil attributes even across large spatial scales and soil and land use types. Collectively, we were able to demonstrate the largely untapped potential of microorganisms to indicate the condition of soil and thereby influence the way that we monitor the effects of anthropogenic activity on soil ecosystems into the future.",2017,83,10.1128/AEM.02826-16

In the present study, we used isolation and molecular techniques to investigate the diversity of Cyanobacteria associated with the intertidal marine sponge host Hymeniacidon perlevis, collected along the coast of Portugal ( Northeast Atlantic). Cyanobacterial community profiling and comparison using 16S rRNA gene-sequence-based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) revealed different banding patterns between the sponge tissue and seawater. We succeeded in isolating Cyanobacteria belonging to the genera Synechococcus, Cyanobium, Synechocystis, Nodosilinea, Pseudanabaena and Phormidesmis from the sponge tissues. Chlorophyll a concentrations were very low, in spite of the diversity of cyanobacteria identified. DGGE analyses comparing sponge samples and ambient seawater further revealed the presence of Synechococcus, Acaryochloris and Prochlorococcus. Many of the isolated cyanobacteria show a high similarity with previously isolated free-living cyanobacteria from the coast of Portugal, highlighting the advantages of using sponges as a source for obtaining cyanobacteria present only in small amount in seawater.",2017,79,10.3354/ame01830

They also examined the relative effects of environmental filtering, dispersal limitations and seasonality on community assembly. Their results indicated that (i) in the surface layer, abundant taxa are primarily influenced by dispersal limitations and rare taxa are primarily influenced by environmental filtering, whereas (ii) in the subsurface layer, both abundant and rare sub-communities are only weakly influenced by environmental filtering but are strongly influenced by dispersal limitations. Moreover, (iii) abundant taxa exhibit stronger temporal variability than rare taxa. They also found that abundant and rare sub-communities display similar spatial richness patterns that are negatively correlated with latitude and chlorophyll a and positively correlated with temperature. In summary, environmental filtering and dispersal limitations have different effects on abundant and rare picoeukaryotic sub-communities in different layers. Thus, depth appears as an essential variable that governs the structuring patterns of picoeukaryotic communities in the oceans and should be thoroughly considered to develop a more comprehensive understanding of oceanic microbial assemblages.",2017,19,10.1111/1462-2920.13606

Ice worms were collected from two distinct glaciers in Alaska, Harding Icefield and Byron Glacier, and glacier surfaces were also sampled for comparison. Marked differences were observed in bacterial community structures between the ice worm and glacier surface samples. Several bacterial phylotypes were detected almost exclusively in the ice worms, and these bacteria were phylogenetically affiliated with either animal-associated lineages or, interestingly, clades mostly consisting of glacier-indigenous species. The former included bacteria that belong to Mollicutes, Chlamydiae, Rickettsiales, and Lachnospiraceae, while the latter included Arcicella and Herminiimonas phylotypes. Among these bacteria enriched in ice worm samples, Mollicutes, Arcicella, and Herminiimonas phylotypes were abundantly and consistently detected in the ice worm samples; these phylotypes constituted the core microbiota associated with the ice worm. A fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis showed that Arcicella cells specifically colonized the epidermis of the ice worms. Other bacterial phylotypes detected in the ice worm samples were also abundantly recovered from the respective habitat glaciers; these bacteria may be food for ice worms to digest or temporary residents. Nevertheless, some were overrepresented in the ice worm RNA samples; they may also function as facultative gut bacteria. Our results indicate that the community structure of bacteria associated with ice worms is distinct from that in the associated glacier and includes worm-specific and facultative, glacier-indigenous lineages.",2017,32,10.1264/jsme2.ME16158

Environmental conditions strongly shape the metabolic function of microbial communities; however, other processes such as biotic interactions, random demographic drift or dispersal limitation may also influence community dynamics. The relative importance of these processes and their effects on community function remain largely unknown. To address this uncertainty, here we examined bacterial and archaeal communities in replicate miniature aquatic ecosystem s contained within the foliage of wild bromeliads. We used marker gene sequencing to infer the taxonomic composition within nine metabolic functional groups, and shotgun environmental DNA sequencing to estimate the relative abundances of these groups. We found that all of the bromeliads exhibited remarkably similar functional community structures, but that the taxonomic composition within individual functional groups was highly variable. Furthermore, using statistical analyses, we found that non-neutral processes, including environmental filtering and potentially biotic interactions, at least partly shaped the composition within functional groups and were more important than spatial dispersal limitation and demographic drift. Hence both the functional structure and taxonomic composition within functional groups of natural microbial communities may be shaped by non-neutral and roughly separate processes.",2017,1,10.1038/s41559-016-0015

Most of the current understanding of these two subgroups is derived from studies in marine environments. In comparison, information on the spatial distribution of these two subgroups in freshwater environments is very limited. The present study analysed the biogeographical pattern of those two groups on a large-river scale (i.e. the Songhua River catchment, >1000 km). The results showed that the concentrations of LNA and HNA bacteria were distributed over a wide range from 5.45 x 10(4) to 4.43 x 10(6) cells mL(-1), and from 1.35 x 10(5) to 4.37 x 10(6) cells mL(-1) respectively. The two groups have almost equal proportions in the Songhua River, with the average contribution of LNA bacteria reaching 47.0%. In comparison, the abundance of LNA bacteria in the mainstream was significantly higher than in the tributaries. The cytometric expressions (green fluorescence and side scatter) within LNA and HNA were strongly covaried, which implies that these two subgroups are intrinsically linked. Multivariate redundancy analysis indicated that both the abundance and cytometric characteristics of co-occurring LNA and HNA bacteria were regulated differently in the Songhua River.

We predicted the biogeographic patterns of soil archaeal, bacterial, and fungal communities across 110 natural forest sites along a transect across four vegetation zones in Eastern China. The distance decay relationships demonstrated the distinct biogeographic patterns of archaeal, bacterial, and fungal communities. While historical processes mainly influenced bacterial community variations, spatially autocorrelated environmental variables mainly influenced the fungal community. Archaea did not display a distance decay pattern along the vegetation gradient. Bacterial community diversity and structure were correlated with the ratio of acid oxalate-soluble Fe to free Fe oxides (Feo/Fed ratio). Fungal community diversity and structure were influenced by dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and free aluminum (Ald), respectively. The role of these environmental variables was confirmed by the correlations between dominant operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and edaphic variables. However, most of the dominant OTUs were not correlated with the major driving variables for the entire communities. These results demonstrate that soil archaea, bacteria, and fungi have different biogeographic patterns and driving processes along this continental-scale natural vegetation gradient, implying different community assembly mechanisms and ecological functions for archaea, bacteria, and fungi in soil ecosystems. IMPORTANCE Understanding biogeographic patterns is a precursor to improving our knowledge of the function of microbiomes and to predicting ecosystem responses to environmental change. Using natural forest soil samples from 110 locations, this study is one of the largest attempts to comprehensively understand the different patterns of soil archaeal, bacterial, and fungal biogeography at the continental scale in eastern China. These patterns in natural forest sites could ascertain reliable soil microbial biogeographic patterns by eliminating anthropogenic influences. This information provides guidelines for monitoring the belowground ecosystems decline and restoration. Meanwhile, the deviations in the soil microbial communities from corresponding natural forest states indicate the extent of degradation of the soil ecosystem. Moreover, given the association between vegetation type and the microbial community, this information could be used to predict the long-term response of the underground ecosystem to the vegetation distribution caused by global climate change.",2017,2,10.1128/mSystems.00174-16

However, historical events, such as past environmental conditions or dispersal events, can be important as well. We provide a short summary of the processes that can lead to so-called legacy effects, where past biotic or abiotic factors influence the composition of present-day communities. Priority effects, which arise if early colonizers gain advantage over later-arriving species, can lead to persistent legacy effects. In contrast, time-lags in environmental selection can lead to transient legacy effects. Dispersal rates as well as factors that influence the adaptability of species to changing environmental conditions should be important factors that determine the relative importance of contemporary selection versus historical processes and whether legacy effects are likely to be permanent or temporary. Working with microbial communities offers the advantage of feasible time series studies and multi-generation experiments, and can therefore make important contributions to a novel systematic framework on how historical processes shape complex metacommunities in nature.",2017,79,10.3354/ame01816

The bacteria data analysis is linked to the researchers biological traits (sex, age, geographical area) and also other external factors which are the daily activities and any elements that familiar with the researcher lifestyle. The relationship and connection between the visual analysis of bacteria, photographs of researchers belongings in daily life, and text documents of diary is the conceptual idea of self-portrait that the researcher want to express and grasp through the production of final artwork. This research is manipulating science which is microbiology process in implementing the idea of self-portrait in such conceptual art way. It is hope that this study can contribute to the exploration of science through the art perspectives and scopes in Malaysia.",2017,23,10.1166/asl.2017.7238
"Nguyen, TT; Robertsen, EM; Landfald, B",Viral assemblage variation in an Arctic shelf seafloor,AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,"Spatial differences in microbial communities are observable even in habitats with moderate environmental variation, such as within the pelagic zone or seafloor of geographically finite regions of the oceans. Here we explore whether biogeographical variations are also manifested at this level in the structure of viral assemblages by comparing DNA viromes from the Barents Sea upper seafloor, collected at 5 geographically separated locations. Of the open reading frames, 27 to 44% showed significant similarity to genes of viral genomes in the Refseq database. The majority of the identified open reading frames, i.e. 86 to 95%, were affiliated with sequences of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) viruses, but the ssDNA virus genetic material was likely strongly overrepresented due to the use of phi29 DNA polymerase for amplifying viral DNA. The majority of ssDNA virus sequences originated from the Microviridae family of phages and the eukaryotic Circular Rep-encoding ssDNA (CRESS-DNA) viruses. The sediment virus assemblages showed higher overall similarity to counterparts from deep-sea sediment of the Pacific Ocean than to, e.g., Arctic Ocean pelagic viromes, supporting the presence of common compositional features in sediment viral assemblages across continental- scale geographical separations. The Barents Sea viromes grouped biogeographically in accordance with the south-north environmental division of this Arctic sea by the oceanic polar front, thereby mirroring a corresponding 16S rRNA gene-based biogeographical division of the bacterial communities. However, compositional differences in the eukaryotic virus assemblages rather than the bacteriophages appeared to be the primary basis for this spatial separation.",2017,78,10.3354/ame01808
"Evans, S; Martiny, JBH; Allison, SD",Effects of dispersal and selection on stochastic assembly in microbial communities,ISME JOURNAL,"Stochastic processes can play an important role in microbial community assembly. Dispersal limitation is one process that can increase stochasticity and obscure relationships between environmental variables and microbial community composition, but the relationship between dispersal, selection and stochasticity has not been described in a comprehensive way. We examine how dispersal and its interactions with drift and selection alter the consistency with which microbial communities assemble using a realistic, individual-based model of microbial decomposers. Communities were assembled under different environmental conditions and dispersal rates in repeated simulations, and we examined the compositional difference among replicate communities colonizing the same type of leaf litter (within-group distance), as well as between-group deterministic selection. Dispersal rates below 25% turnover per year resulted in high within-group distance among communities and no significant environmental effects. As dispersal limitation was alleviated, both within- and between-group distance decreased, but despite this homogenization, deterministic environmental effects remained significant. In addition to direct effects of dispersal rate, stochasticity of community composition was influenced by an interaction between dispersal and selection strength. Specifically, communities experiencing stronger selection (less favorable litter chemistries) were more stochastic, possibly because lower biomass and richness intensified drift or priority effects. Overall, we show that dispersal rate can significantly alter patterns of community composition. Partitioning the effects of dispersal, selection and drift based on static patterns of microbial composition will be difficult, if not impossible. Experiments will be required to tease apart these complex interactions between assembly processes shaping microbial communities.",2017,11,10.1038/ismej.2016.96
"Na, XF; Xu, TT; Li, M; Ma, F; Kardol, P",Bacterial diversity in the rhizosphere of two phylogenetically closely related plant species across environmental gradients,JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS,"Purpose Rhizosphere soil bacterial communities are crucial to plant growth, health, and stress resistance. In order to detect how bacterial communities associated with the rhizosphere of phylogenetically related plant species vary in terms of composition, function, and diversity, we investigated the rhizosphere bacterial community structure of two perennial shrub species, Caragana jubata and Caragana roborovskyi, under natural field conditions in northwest China and analyzed the influence of soil properties and environmental factors. Materials and methods Eighteen root samples, eight for C. jubata, and ten for C. roborovskyi, along with any adherent soil particles, were collected from multiple sites in northwest China. The rhizosphere soil was washed from the roots, and bacterial communities were analyzed using Illumina MiSeq sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons. Then, alpha-diversity and beta-diversity were calculated using QIIME. Results and discussion Across species, Proteobacteria (29 %), Actinobacteria (15 %), Chloroflexi (10 %), Acidobacteria (10 %), Bacteroidetes (8 %), Firmicutes (8 %), Planctomycetes (7 %), Gemmatimonadetes (4 %), and Verrucomicrobia (3 %) were themost abundant phyla in the rhizosphere of C. jubata and C. roborovskyi. However, principal co-ordinates analysis indicated strong interspecific patterns of bacterial rhizosphere communities. Further, the richness of Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Verrucomicrobia, Firmicutes, and Nitrospirae was significantly higher in the rhizosphere of C. jubata compared with C. roborovskyi, while the opposite was found for Actinobacteria and Cyanobacteria. However, the Shannon index showed no significant difference in alpha-diversity between C. jubata and C. roborovskyi. Distance-based redundancy analysis indicated that soil properties and environmental factors exerted strong influences on the structure of the rhizosphere bacterial community and explained 47 and 46 % of community variances between samples, respectively. Conclusions Our results showed strong interspecific clustering of the bacterial rhizosphere communities of C. roborovskyi and C. jubata. Altitude explained most of the variation in the composition of bacterial rhizosphere communities of C. roborovskyi and C. jubata, followed by soil pH, water content, organic matter content, total nitrogen content, and mean annual rainfall.",2017,17,10.1007/s11368-016-1486-2
"Ardley, J",Legumes of the Thar desert and their nitrogen fixing Ensifer symbionts,PLANT AND SOIL,"Background Nodulated legumes form a large component of the flora of desert regions, but comparatively few studies have characterised their symbiotic interactions, or their rhizobial microsymbionts. The Thar desert is a sub-tropical desert with infertile, alkaline soils in the northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent, which is home to a large number of legumes that provide food and fuel, or are of medicinal importance to the local people. In the latest in a series of studies on the nodulated legumes of the Thar desert and their associated rhizobia, Sankhla et al. (2016), this issue, have characterised strains of Ensifer rhizobia isolated from nodules of the native mimosoid legume shrub Vachellia (Acacia) jacquemontii. Scope These studies suggest that Ensifer rhizobia are the dominant microsymbionts of legumes native to the Thar desert and are particularly well-adapted to the arid conditions and alkaline soils found there. The Ensifer strains that nodulate V. jacquemontii may constitute a novel species, based on 16S rRNA and Multi Locus Sequence Analysis. Symbiotic adaptation of these rhizobia to local host legumes has involved horizontal gene transfer of symbiosis genes. Conclusions These findings provide further insights into the evolution of legume-rhizobia symbioses and how plants and rhizobia are adapted to and can survive in stressful conditions.",2017,410,10.1007/s11104-016-3125-5

Broad-leaved Korean pine mixed forest (Pinus koraiensis as an edificator) is the most representative zonal climax vegetation in the humid region of northeastern China; their vertical zonation is the most intact and representative on Changbai Mountain. In this study, we analyzed the composition and diversity of soil fungal communities in the Korean pine forest on Changbai Mountain at elevations ranging from 699 to 1177 m using Illumina High-throughput sequencing. We obtained a total 186,663 optimized sequences, with an average length of 268.81 bp. We found soil fungal diversity index was decreased with increasing elevation from 699 to 937 m and began to rise after reaching 1044 m; the richness and evenness indices were decreased with an increase in elevation. Soil fungal compositions at the phylum, class and genus levels varied significantly at different elevations, but with the same dominant fungi. Beta-diversity analysis indicated that the similarity of fungal communities decreased with an increased vertical distance between the sample plots, showing a distance-decay relationship. Variation partition analysis showed that geographic distance (mainly elevation gradient) only explained 20.53 % of the total variation of fungal community structure, while soil physicochemical factors explained 69.78 %.",2017,33,10.1007/s11274-016-2133-1
"Lengger, SK; Fromont, J; Grice, K","Tapping the archives: the sterol composition of marine sponge species, as determined non-invasively from museum-preserved specimens, reveals biogeographical features",GEOBIOLOGY,"Over 8600 species are currently recorded in the phylum Porifera (sponges). They produce a large diversity of biochemical compounds including sterols, with more than 250 different sterols identified. Some of these sterols are of great interest, due to their use for fingerprinting in ecological and biomarker (molecular fossil) studies. As a large number of identified extant species from biodiversity surveys are housed in museum collections, preserved in ethanol, these present a potentially rich source of identified specimens for comparative lipid analyses. Here, we show that, in at least one species, sterol distributions obtained from the ethanol used to preserve specimens of sponges were representative, and comparable to the sterol distribution obtained from wet-frozen and from freeze-dried tissue from the same species. We employed both GC-MS and two-dimensional gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GCxGC-TOFMS), with an improved signal-to-noise ratio for even minor constituents. Analysis of two additional specimens of the same species, but of different provenance, resulted in detection of marked differences in sterol composition, which could be attributed to variations in geography, environmental conditions, microbial communities, diet or cryptic speciation. The possibility of using ethanol from identified, preserved museum sponges could drastically increase the number of available samples. This could enable the study of their sterol complements, and the detailed investigation of differences due to geographical and oceanographic, phylogenetic, and other factors in unprecedented detail.",2017,15,10.1111/gbi.12206
"Baltar, F; Aristegui, J",Fronts at the Surface Ocean Can Shape Distinct Regions of Microbial Activity and Community Assemblages Down to the Bathypelagic Zone: The Azores Front as a Case Study,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,"Oceanic fronts are widespread features which separate distinct water masses. They are well known to control the distribution of microbial communities in surface waters, although there is scarce information on their role in delimiting critical functions that microbes perform, and on whether their effects can be translated down into the dark ocean. Here we carried out the first study on the variability of hydrolysis of organic matter (extracellular enzymatic activity; FEA) across a permanent front (the Azores Front), coupled with changes in microbial assemblage composition, from the surface down to the bathypelagic zone. The front separated the study area (enclosed into the North Atlantic Subtropical Gyral Province) into two distinct latitudinal sub-regions with sharp differences in the abundance of autotrophic and heterotrophic microbial assemblages, as well as in the extracellular enzymes activities of glucosidases, alkaline phosphatase, and leucine aminopeptidase. South of the front there was an abrupt decline in the abundance of picophytoplankton as well as in heterotrophic prokaryotes with high nucleic-acid content, but an increase in the abundance of prokaryotes with high side-scatter, an indication that cells were growing attached to particles. Concomitantly, there was also an increase in the aminopeptidase to glucosidase ratio, a proxy of higher degradation of proteinaceous material relative to carbohydrates. Interestingly, these sharp changes in microbial assemblages and enzymatic activities north and south of the front were translated down to the deep ocean. Our results suggest that permanent fronts, like the Azores Front, can act as ecological boundaries in the ocean (even within a biogeographical province), in terms of microbial community structure and biogeochemical cycling. Oriented studies on oceanic fronts down to the deep ocean will help to understand how the variability of these widely-extended hydrographic futures will impact microbial communities and carbon cycling in a future ocean affected by trends in global warming, de-oxygenation and acidification.",2017,4,10.3389/fmars.2017.00252
"Hoarfrost, A; Arnosti, C",Heterotrophic Extracellular Enzymatic Activities in the Atlantic Ocean Follow Patterns Across Spatial and Depth Regimes,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,"Heterotrophic microbial communities use extracellular enzymes to initialize degradation of high molecular weight organic matter in the ocean. The potential of microbial communities to access organic matter, and the resultant rates of hydrolysis, affect the efficiency of the biological pump as well as the rate and location of organic carbon cycling in surface and deep waters. In order to investigate spatial- and depth-related patterns in microbial enzymatic capacities in the ocean, we measured hydrolysis rates of six high-molecular-weight polysaccharides and two low-molecular-weight substrate proxies at sites spanning 38 degrees S to 10 degrees N in the Atlantic Ocean, and at six depths ranging from surface to bottom water. In surface to upper mesopelagic waters, the spectrum of substrates hydrolyzed followed distinct patterns, with hydrolytic assemblages more similar vertically within a single station than at similar depths across multiple stations. Additionally, the proportion of total hydrolysis occurring above the pycnocline, and the spectrum of substrates hydrolyzed in mesopelagic and deep waters, was positively related to the strength of stratification at a site, while other physichochemical parameters were generally poor predictors of the measured hydrolysis rates. Spatial as well as depth-driven constraints on heterotrophic hydrolytic capacities result in broad variations in potential carbon-degrading activity in the ocean. The spectrum of enzymatic capabilities and rates of hydrolysis in the ocean, and the proportion of organic carbon hydrolyzed above the permanent thermocline, may influence the efficiency of the biological pump and net carbon export across distinct latitudinal and depth regions.",2017,4,10.3389/fmars.2017.00200
"de Rezende, JR; Hubert, CRJ; Roy, H; Kjeldsen, KU; Jorgensen, BB",Estimating the Abundance of Endospores of Sulfate-Reducing Bacteria in Environmental Samples by Inducing Germination and Exponential Growth,GEOMICROBIOLOGY JOURNAL,"It is a challenge to quantitatively distinguish active from dormant microbial populations in environmental samples. Here we present an approach for estimating the abundance of dormant sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), present as viable endospores in environmental samples. This is achieved by inducing endospores to germinate and grow exponentially. We demonstrate this approach for thermophilic SRB in temperate sediment from Aarhus Bay, Denmark. The approach is based on measuring bulk sulfate reduction rates (SRRs) in pasteurized sediment and calculating associated cell-specific SRRs based on average values for SRB growth yield and cell size known from exponentially growing pure cultures. The method presented is a faster bioassay than most probable number enumerations and has the potential to distinguish between slow- and fast-growing SRB populations in the same sample. This bioassay is attractive given the challenges posed by endospores with respect to cell permeabilization and lysis, which are prerequisite in quantitative microscopy- and nucleic acid extraction-based strategies. These molecular approaches additionally rely on designing target-appropriate oligonucleotide probes, whereas the method presented here considers the trait of interest more broadly. This strategy thus presents a useful complement to other methods in ecological investigations of microbial biogeography and for specific industrial applications such as reservoir souring and corrosion risk assessments in the oil and gas sector.",2017,34,10.1080/01490451.2016.1190805
