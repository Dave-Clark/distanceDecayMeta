Marine and giant viruses as indicators of a marine microbial community in a riverine system	MICROBIOLOGYOPEN												Viral communities are important for ecosystem function as they are involved in critical biogeochemical cycles and controlling host abundance. This study investigates riverine viral communities around a small rural town that influences local water inputs. Myoviridae, Siphoviridae, Phycodnaviridae, Mimiviridae, Herpesviridae, and Podoviridae were the most abundant families. Viral species upstream and downstream of the town were similar, with Synechoccocus phage, salinus, Prochlorococcus phage, Mimivirus A, and Human herpes 6A virus most abundant, contributing to 4.9-38.2% of average abundance within the metagenomic profiles, with Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus present in metagenomes as the expected hosts for the phage. Overall, the majority of abundant viral species were or were most similar to those of marine origin. At over 60km to the river mouth, the presence of marine communities provides some support for the Baas-Becking hypothesis everything is everywhere, but, the environment selects. We conclude marine microbial species may occur more frequently in freshwater systems than previously assumed, and hence may play important roles in some freshwater ecosystems within tens to a hundred kilometers from the sea.																	2045-8827					DEC	2016	5	6					1071	1084		10.1002/mbo3.392						WOS:000390567300014	27506856

The isolates were recovered from 10 different sites, trapped each time with the local cultivar grown in the same field. Four loci were sequenced in order to characterize the isolates, including two housekeeping genes (recA and glnII), one plasmidic symbiotic gene (nodC) and one locus from another plasmid (prL11). In several isolates, two different copies of glnII were detected and sequenced, suggesting a unique duplication event, which has never been reported previously. There was no correlation between the genetic differentiation among cultivars and among bacteria, showing that the evolution of the bacterial population was independent, at least partially, from the host plant. By placing the haplo-types-in a wide-ranging phylogenetic reconstruction, it was shown that the diversity detected in Morocco was spread throughout the different clades detected worldwide. The differentiation between areas relied on frequency variations of haplotypes rather than a presence/absence pattern. This finding raises new questions concerning bacterial genetic resource preservation, and confirms the old tenet everything is everywhere but the environment selects. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

An interesting approach is to use lignocellulose-degrading microbial communities by using different environmental sources of microbial inocula. However, it remains unclear whether the inoculum source matters for the degradation process. Here, we addressed this question by verifying the lignocellulose degradation potential of wheat (Triticum aestivum) straw by microbial consortia generated from three different microbial inoculum sources, i.e., forest soil, canal sediment and decaying wood. We selected these consortia through ten sequential-batch enrichments by dilution-to-stimulation using wheat straw as the sole carbon source. We monitored the changes in microbial composition and abundance, as well as their associated degradation capacity and enzymatic activities. Overall, the microbial consortia developed well on the substrate, with progressively-decreasing net average generation times. Each final consortium encompassed bacterial/fungal communities that were distinct in composition but functionally similar, as they all revealed high substrate degradation activities. However, we did find significant differences in the metabolic diversities per consortium: in wood-derived consortia cellobiohydrolases prevailed, in soil-derived ones beta-glucosidases, and in sediment-derived ones several activities. Isolates recovered from the consortia showed considerable metabolic diversities across the consortia. This confirmed that, although the overall lignocellulose degradation was similar, each consortium had a unique enzyme activity pattern. Clearly, inoculum source was the key determinant of the composition of the final microbial degrader consortia, yet with varying enzyme activities. Hence, in accord with Beyerincks, everything is everywhere, the environment selects the source determines consortium composition.

J	Li, LW; Ma, ZS				Li, Lianwei; Ma, Zhanshan (Sam)			Testing the Neutral Theory of Biodiversity with Human Microbiome Datasets	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												The human microbiome project (HMP) has made it possible to test important ecological theories for arguably the most important ecosystem to human health-the human microbiome. Existing limited number of studies have reported conflicting evidence in the case of the neutral theory; the present study aims to comprehensively test the neutral theory with extensive HMP datasets covering all five major body sites inhabited by the human microbiome. Utilizing 7437 datasets of bacterial community samples, we discovered that only 49 communities (less than 1%) satisfied the neutral theory, and concluded that human microbial communities are not neutral in general. The 49 positive cases, although only a tiny minority, do demonstrate the existence of neutral processes. We realize that the traditional doctrine of microbial biogeography Everything is everywhere, but the environment selects first proposed by Baas-Becking resolves the apparent contradiction. The first part of Baas-Becking doctrine states that microbes are not dispersal-limited and therefore are neutral prone, and the second part reiterates that the freely dispersed microbes must endure selection by the environment. Therefore, in most cases, it is the host environment that ultimately shapes the community assembly and tip the human microbiome to niche regime.																	2045-2322					AUG 16	2016	6								31448	10.1038/srep31448						WOS:000392117800001	27527985

Deep-sea planktonic communities are almost completely dependent upon organic carbon sinking from the productive surface, forming a vital component of global biogeochemical cycles. However, despite their importance, viruses from the deep ocean remain largely unknown. Here, we describe the first complete genomes of deep-sea viruses assembled from metagenomic fosmid libraries. Candidatus Pelagibacter (SAR11) phage HTVC010P and Puniceispirillum phage HMO-2011 are considered the most abundant cultured marine viruses known to date. Remarkably, some of the viruses described here recruited as many reads from deep waters as these viruses do in the photic zone, and, considering the gigantic scale of the bathypelagic habitat, these genomes provide information about what could be some of the most abundant viruses in the world at large. Their role in the viral shunt in the global ocean could be very significant. Despite the challenges encountered in inferring the identity of their hosts, we identified one virus predicted to infect members of the globally distributed SAR11 cluster. We also identified a number of putative proviruses from diverse taxa, including deltaproteobacteria, bacteroidetes, SAR11, and gammaproteobacteria. Moreover, our findings also indicate that lysogeny is the preferred mode of existence for deep-sea viruses inhabiting an energy-limited environment, in sharp contrast to the predominantly lytic lifestyle of their photic-zone counterparts. Some of the viruses show a widespread distribution, supporting the tenet everything is everywhere for the deep-ocean virome. IMPORTANCE The deep sea is among the largest known habitats and a critical cog in biogeochemical cycling but remains under-explored in its microbiology. Even more than is the case for its prokaryotic community, our knowledge of its viral component has remained limited by the paucity of information provided by studies dependent upon short sequence fragments. In this work, we attempt to fill this existing gap by using a combination of classical fosmid libraries with next-generation sequencing and assembly to recover long viral genomic fragments. We have sequenced ca. 6,000 fosmids from two metagenomics libraries made from prokaryotic biomass from the deep Mediterranean Sea and recovered twenty-eight complete viral genomes, all of them novel and quite distinct from all previously described viral genomes. They are preferentially found in deeper waters and are widely distributed all over the oceans. To our knowledge, this is the first report on complete and cosmopolitan viral genomes from the bathypelagic habitat.

Every Gene Is Everywhere but the Environment Selects: Global Geolocalization of Gene Sharing in Environmental Samples through Network Analysis	GENOME BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												The spatial distribution of microbes on our planet is famously formulated in the Baas Becking hypothesis as everything is everywhere but the environment selects. While this hypothesis does not strictly rule out patterns caused by geographical effects on ecology and historical founder effects, it does propose that the remarkable dispersal potential of microbes leads to distributions generally shaped by environmental factors rather than geographical distance. By constructing sequence similarity networks from uncultured environmental samples, we show that microbial gene pool distributions are not influenced nearly as much by geography as ecology, thus extending the Bass Becking hypothesis from whole organisms to microbial genes. We find that gene pools are shaped by their broad ecological niche (such as sea water, fresh water, host, and airborne). We find that freshwater habitats act as a gene exchange bridge between otherwise disconnected habitats. Finally, certain antibiotic resistance genes deviate from the general trend of habitat specificity by exhibiting a high degree of cross-habitat mobility. The strong cross-habitat mobility of antibiotic resistance genes is a cause for concern and provides a paradigmatic example of the rate by which genes colonize new habitats when new selective forces emerge.

Experimental demonstration of an Allee effect in microbial populations	BIOLOGY LETTERS												Microbial populations can be dispersal limited. However, microorganisms that successfully disperse into physiologically ideal environments are not guaranteed to establish. This observation contradicts the Baas-Becking tenet: Everything is everywhere, but the environment selects. Allee effects, which manifest in the relationship between initial population density and probability of establishment, could explain this observation. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that small populations of Vibrio fischeri are subject to an intrinsic demographic Allee effect. Populations subjected to predation by the bacterivore Cafeteria roenbergensis display both intrinsic and extrinsic demographic Allee effects. The estimated critical threshold required to escape positive density dependence is around 5, 20 or 90 cells ml(-1) under conditions of high carbon resources, low carbon resources or low carbon resources with predation, respectively. This work builds on the foundations of modem microbial ecology, demonstrating that mechanisms controlling macroorganisms apply to microorganisms, and provides a statistical method to detect Allee effects in data.

A widening of this perspective to include evolutionary considerations has been increasingly developed in response to the rising rates of genetic change in both pathogen populations and tree populations due to human activities. Aims Here, five topics for which the evolutionary perspective is especially relevant are highlighted. Results The first relates to the evolutionary diversity of fungi and fungal-like organisms, with issues linked to the identification of species and their ecological niches. The second theme deals with the evolutionary processes that allow forest pathogens to adapt to new hosts after introductions or to become more virulent in homogeneous plantations. The third theme presents issues linked to disease resistance in tree breeding programs (e.g., growth-defense trade-offs) and proposes new criteria and methods for more durable resistance. The last two themes are dedicated to the biotic environment of the tree-pathogen system, namely, hyperparasites and tree microbiota, as possible solutions for health management. Conclusion We conclude by highlighting three major conceptual advances brought by evolutionary biology, i.e., that (i) not everything is everywhere, (ii) evolution of pathogen populations can occur on short time scales, and (iii) the tree is a multitrophic community. We further translate these into a framework for immediate policy recommendations and future directions for research.

In the present study, we performed data-mining for 18S rDNA sequences of glomeromycotan fungi in order to test this hypothesis. 18S rDNA sequences targeted using AM1-NS31 fragments were retrieved from GenBank, with a total of 1768 sequences collected from 34 sites worldwide. In total, 229, 330 and 518 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were defined based on 97, 98 and 99 % similarity, respectively. The 97 % OTUs showed a limited geographical range of glomeromycotan fungi. Among the OTUs, 58.1 % were endemic, and 17.9 % and 9.2 % were found in two and three sites, respectively. The most widespread OTU was shared by 17 sites. Phylogenetic structure analysis demonstrated that most local communities (26 of 34) were clustered. OTUs with larger host breadth had wider geographic ranges. A significant distance-decay relationship was revealed that was independent of habitat. Cluster analysis showed that fungal composition was not related to habitat, while Fast UniFrac analysis indicated that the distribution of Glomeromycota was affected by temperature. Taken together, these results suggest that glomeromycotan fungi were not randomly distributed under natural conditions; rather, they were affected by host plants, dispersal ability and temperature. Thus, the distribution of glomeromycotan fungi argues against the hypothesis that everything is everywhere..																	1590-4261	1869-2044				MAR	2016	66	1					361	371		10.1007/s13213-015-1116-z						WOS:000370078700034

Antarctic bdelloid rotifers: diversity, endemism and evolution	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Antarctica is an isolated continent whose conditions challenge the survival of living organisms. High levels of endemism are now known in many Antarctic organisms, including algae, tardigrades, nematodes and microarthropods. Bdelloid rotifers are a key, widespread and abundant group of Antarctic microscopic invertebrates. However, their diversity, regional distribution and endemism have received little attention until recently. We provide the first authoritative review on Antarctic Bdelloidea, based on published data and new collections. Our analysis reveals the extreme levels of bdelloid endemism in Antarctica. Sixty-six bdelloid morphospecies are now confirmed from the continent, and 83-91 putative species are identified using molecular approaches (depending on the delimitation method used). Twelve previously unknown species are described based on both morphology and molecular analyses. Molecular analyses indicate that only two putative species found in Antarctica proved to be truly cosmopolitan. The level of endemism based on the available data set (95%) is higher than that in any other continent, with many bdelloid species occurring only in maritime or continental Antarctica. These findings are consistent with the long-term presence of Bdelloidea in Antarctica, with their considerable isolation facilitating intraregional radiation, providing further evidence that does not support the microbial global ubiquity hypothesis that everything is everywhere..

It therefore presents a unique model system to address ecological questions regarding niche adaptation and Baas Beckings long standing hypothesis of everything is everywhere, but the environment selects. Here, we present the first assessment of the microbial diversity in these lakes. We sampled the lakes in August and December and used 454 pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA amplicons to analyze the microbial diversity. The diversity patterns between lakes and seasons were compared and the bacterial community composition was correlated with key chemical and physical parameters. Distinct patterns of bacterial diversity only emerged at the level of individual OTUs (operational taxonomic units), but not at the level of the major bacterial phyla. This emphasizes the high functional and physiological diversity among bacterial species within a phylum and calls for analysis of biodiversity at the level of OTUs in order to understand fine scale biogeography. We were able to identify a number of cosmopolitan OTUs as well as specialist OTUs that were restricted to certain lakes or seasons, suggesting adaptation to specific ecological niches.

J	Kraemer, SA; Kassen, R				Kraemer, Susanne A.; Kassen, Rees			Patterns of Local Adaptation in Space and Time among Soil Bacteria	AMERICAN NATURALIST												Our understanding of microbial biogeography has been governed by the dictum Everything is everywhere, but the environment selects. In other words, the distribution of microbes is thought to occur in a regime of extensive dispersal and strong selection, generating local adaptation. However, direct tests of these assumptions are rare. Here, we investigate the extent of local adaptation in space and time of a collection of soil-derived microbial isolates, most belonging to the genus Pseudomonas, across a growing season from a deciduous forest in western Quebec, Canada, using a reciprocal transplant design. Average performance of all clones varied substantially in both space and time, in line with the expectation of strong selection in both dimensions. The behavior of genotype-by-environment variance in fitness and its components, responsiveness and inconsistency, in space and through time suggests that the strength of divergent selection increases as sites become more distant from each other in both dimensions. However, divergent selection was not strong enough to maintain different specialized types across the environments studied, which suggests that Pseudomonas and their close relatives are not locally adapted to the prevailing conditions of growth.

Current models of marine microbial systems and biogeochemical cycles do not reflect this fundamental organizing principle. Here, we investigate the evolutionary adaptive potential of marine microbial systems under environmental change and introduce explicit Darwinian adaptation into an ocean modelling framework, simulating evolving phytoplankton communities in space and time. To this end, we adopt tools from adaptive dynamics theory, evaluating the fitness of invading mutants over annual timescales, replacing the resident if a fitter mutant arises. Using the evolutionary framework, we examine how community assembly, specifically the emergence of phytoplankton cell size diversity, reflects the combined effects of bottom-up and top-down controls. When compared with a species-selection approach, based on the paradigm that Everything is everywhere, but the environment selects, we show that (i) the selected optimal trait values are similar; (ii) the patterns emerging from the adaptive model are more robust, but (iii) the two methods lead to different predictions in terms of emergent diversity. We demonstrate that explicitly evolutionary approaches to modelling marine microbial populations and functionality are feasible and practical in time-varying, space-resolving settings and provide a new tool for exploring evolutionary interactions on a range of timescales in the ocean.

The niche of an invasive marine microbe in a subtropical freshwater impoundment	ISME JOURNAL												Growing attention in aquatic ecology is focusing on biogeographic patterns in microorganisms and whether these potential patterns can be explained within the framework of general ecology. The long-standing microbiologists credo Everything is everywhere, but, the environment selects suggests that dispersal is not limiting for microbes, but that the environment is the primary determining factor in microbial community composition. Advances in molecular techniques have provided new evidence that biogeographic patterns exist in microbes and that dispersal limitation may actually have an important role, yet more recent study using extremely deep sequencing predicts that indeed everything is everywhere. Using a long-term field study of the invasive marine haptophyte Prymnesium parvum, we characterize the environmental niche of P. parvum in a subtropical impoundment in the southern United States. Our analysis contributes to a growing body of evidence that indicates a primary role for environmental conditions, but not dispersal, in the lakewide abundances and seasonal bloom patterns in this globally important microbe.

ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												According to recent research, bacteria contribute as recurrent associates to the lichen symbiosis. Yet, the variation of the microbiomes within species and across geographically separated populations remained largely elusive. As a quite common dispersal mode, lichens evolved vertical transmission of both fungal and algal partners in specifically designed mitotic propagules. Bacteria, if co-transmitted with these symbiotic propagules, could contribute to a geographical structure of lichen-associated microbiomes. The lung lichen was sampled from three localities in eastern Austria to analyse their associated bacterial communities by bar-coded pyrosequencing, network analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization. For the first time, bacteria were documented to colonize symbiotic propagules of lichens developed for short-distance transmission of the symbionts. The propagules share the overall bacterial community structure with the thalli at class level, except for filamentous Cyanobacteria (Nostocophycideae), and with Alphaproteobacteria as predominant group. All three sampling sites share a core fraction of the microbiome. Bacterial communities of lichen thalli from the same sampling site showed higher similarity than those of distant populations. This variation and the potential co-dispersal of a microbiome fraction with structures of the host organism contribute new aspects to the everything is everywhere hypothesis.

The genera Centropyxis (10 taxa), Plagiopyxis (6), Trinema (5), Cyclopyxis (5) and Euglypha (5) were most diverse. The majority of the recorded species belonged to the group of soil- or litter- inhabiting testate amoebae with cosmopolitan distribution. Some rare species with restricted geographical distribution of the Gondwanan Tropical group have also been found (e.g. Apodera vas, Centropyxis stenodeflandriana, Lamtopyxis callistoma, Plagiopyxis bathystoma and Planhoogenraadia media). The analysis of the distribution of the genus Lamtopyxis demonstrates that, similarly to Apodera vas, the species of this genus may also be used as an example that not everything is everywhere in free-living microbial eukaryotes.																	0324-0770					DEC	2014	66	4					469	476								WOS:000347269100004

We examined variation in the structure of fungal and bacterial communities in boreal streams along large local environmental gradients (e.g. stream size, acidity and nutrients) at intermediate spatial extent. Owing to the intermediate spatial extent of our study area and high dispersal rates of microbes, we expected that local environmental factors would structure stream fungal and bacterial communities. LocationA set of 30 streams was sampled along a geographical transect from western to eastern Finland. MethodsLeaf packs were used as sampling units in each stream. Fungal and bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were determined using pyrosequencing in the laboratory. Species accumulation curves were used to assess how well the regional species pools were sampled. Partial redundancy analysis and partial linear regression were used to determine the relative contributions of environmental and spatial variables to community structure and OTU richness, respectively. ResultsWe found that environmental control was important in structuring fungal and bacterial communities, yet much of the variation was attributable to the shared effects of environmental and spatial predictors, or remained unexplained. The composition of fungal and bacterial communities was most strongly related to water chemistry variables (i.e. pH, aluminium and total phosphorus), whereas habitat variables (i.e. riparian deciduous trees, moss cover, substratum particle size and stream width) were clearly less important. We also found that fungal richness was negatively related to water iron concentration, whereas bacterial richness showed only a weak relationship with water pH. Main conclusionsThe composition and richness of stream microbial communities are mostly related to water chemistry variables at the spatial extent studied, emphasizing an important role for species sorting. This finding supports the traditional perspective that local environmental conditions are important drivers of variation in microbial communities. However, much of the variation in fungal and bacterial communities remained unexplained, suggesting that drivers of these communities are likely to be complex and not yet fully understood.

For microorganisms, a traditional prevailing hypothesis states that everything is everywhere, but the environment selects. Although the bacterial community in floral nectar may be affected by both atmosphere (air-borne bacteria) and animals as dispersal vectors, the environmental and geographic factors that shape microbial communities in floral nectar are unknown. We studied culturable bacterial communities in Asphodelus aestivus floral nectar and in its typical herbivorous bug Capsodes infuscatus, along an aridity gradient. Bacteria were sampled from floral nectar and bugs at four sites, spanning a geographical range of 200 km from Mediterranean to semi-arid conditions, under open and bagged flower treatments. In agreement with the niche assembly hypothesis, the differences in bacterial community compositions were explained by differences in abiotic environmental conditions. These results suggest that microbial model systems are useful for addressing macro-ecological questions. In addition, similar bacterial communities were found in the nectar and on the surface of the bugs that were documented visiting the flowers. These similarities imply that floral nectar bacteria dispersal is shaped not only by air borne bacteria and nectar consumers as previously reported, but also by visiting vectors like the mirid bugs.

J	Aguilar, M; Fiore-Donno, AM; Lado, C; Cavalier-Smith, T				Aguilar, Maria; Fiore-Donno, Anna-Maria; Lado, Carlos; Cavalier-Smith, Thomas			Using environmental niche models to test the everything is everywhere hypothesis for Badhamia	ISME JOURNAL												It is often discussed whether the biogeography of free-living protists is better explained by the everything is everywhere(EiE) hypothesis, which postulates that only ecology drives their distribution, or by the alternative hypothesis of moderate endemicity in which geographic barriers can limit their dispersal. To formally test this, it would be necessary not only to find organisms restricted to a geographical area but also to check for their presence in any other place with a similar ecology. We propose the use of environmental niche models to generate and test null EiE distributions. Here we have analysed the distribution of 18S rDNA variants (ribotypes) of the myxomycete Badhamia melanospora (belonging to the protozoan phylum Amoebozoa) using 125 specimens from 91 localities. Two geographically structured groups of ribotypes congruent with slight morphological differences in the spores can be distinguished. One group comprises all populations from Argentina and Chile, and the other is formed by populations from North America together with human-introduced populations from other parts of the world. Environmental climatic niche models constructed separately for the two groups have significant differences, but show several overlapping areas. However, only specimens from one group were found in an intensively surveyed area in South America where both niche models overlap. It can be concluded that everything is not everywhere for B. melanospora. This taxon constitutes a complex formed by at least two cryptic species that probably diverged allopatrically in North and South America.

In the microbial world, the concept that everything is everywhere is widely accepted. However, it is much debated whether microbes are easily dispersed globally or whether they, like many macro-organisms, have historical biogeographies. Biogeography can be defined as the science that documents the spatial and temporal distribution of a given taxa in the environment at local, regional and continental scales. Speciation, extinction and dispersal are proposed to explain the generation of biogeographic patterns. Cyanobacteria are a diverse group of microorganisms that inhabit a wide range of ecological niches and are well known for their toxic secondary metabolite production. Knowledge of the evolution and dispersal of these microorganisms is still limited, and further research to understand such topics is imperative. Here, we provide a compilation of the most relevant information regarding these issues to better understand the present state of the art as a platform for future studies, and we highlight examples of both phylogenetic and biogeographic studies in non-symbiotic cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins.

J	Fontaneto, D; Hortal, J				Fontaneto, Diego; Hortal, Joaquin			At least some protist species are not ubiquitous	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												Body size is one of the main regulators of the ecological characteristics of living organisms, including their biogeography. The ubiquity hypothesis for microorganisms states that they are widely distributed, if not cosmopolitan, due to their small size that allows passive dispersal, in contrast to large organisms that are limited by geographical barriers in their active dispersal. Such idea, summarized in the tenet Everything is everywhere, but the environment selects, has driven most of the research in biogeography for microscopic organisms in the last decades, spurring a debate on whether there are fundamental differences in the biogeography of small and large organisms or not (Fenchel & Finlay 2004; Foissner 2008; Hortal 2011). The strong focus on the ubiquity hypothesis may have been often abused to provide a rationale for otherwise descriptive work on the spatial distribution of microscopic organisms; nevertheless, such focus also provides a framework to understand the mechanisms originating and maintaining biodiversity in space. The reliability of the analyses on unknown and understudied organisms is improving, and Heger etal. (2013) is a splendid example on small unicellular eukaryotes of what should be done to overcome the major problems and ambiguities that heated the debate on the ubiquity hypothesis.

Without biogeography, it would be difficult to study the diversity of microorganisms because there would be no way to visualize patterns in variation. Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the wine yeast, is the most important species involved in alcoholic fermentation, and in vineyard ecosystems, it follows the principle of everything is everywhere. Agricultural practices such as farming (organic versus conventional) and floor management systems have selected different populations within this species that are phylogenetically distinct. In fact, recent ecological and geographic studies highlighted that unique strains are associated with particular grape varieties in specific geographical locations. These studies also highlighted that significant diversity and regional character, or terroir, have been introduced into the winemaking process via this association. This diversity of wild strains preserves typicity, the high quality, and the unique flavor of wines. Recently, different molecular methods were developed to study population dynamics of S. cerevisiae strains in both vineyards and wineries. In this review, we will provide an update on the current molecular methods used to reveal the geographical distribution of S. cerevisiae wine yeast.

Body-size distribution and biogeographical patterns in non-marine ostracods (Crustacea: Ostracoda)	BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY												The idea that free-living minute organisms have ubiquitous distributions has been recently revitalized, causing significant controversy. The ubiquitous model predicts that a threshold where ubiquity leaves room to biogeography might exist somewhere along the animal body-size range. In the present study, such a prediction is tested by analysing body-size frequency distribution, species distribution, and local-to-global species ratio at the scale of biogeographical realms in cypridoidean non-marine ostracods, a group with a body-size range in the ubiquitybiogeography (U-B) boundary. Data were gathered for all described extant cypridoidean ostracod species (N=1761), with body-size recorded for 1134 of them. Although local-to-global species ratios show significant over-dispersal of small-body ostracods for the Palaearctic and the Australasian regions, there are explanations alternative to the Everything is Everywhere model that can account for such a result. Indicators of taxonomic structure do not support the hypothesis of a random distribution of cypridoidean species among realms. Nevertheless, the strong biogeography signal occurring at a large scale vanishes at the local scale (country-level within the Palaearctic), and suggests wide dispersion within biogeographical realms. Additional factors, including inconsistent taxonomic criteria for species recognition, uneven sampling effort, and an excess of single-report occurrences, have been identified too as potential distorters of the observed patterns. Taxonomic harmonization, open databases of biogeographical data, and better ecological information are suggested as critical goals that need to be achieved for further understanding of ostracod global distribution patterns.(c) 2013 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2013, 109, 409423.

Marine bacteria exhibit a bipolar distribution	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												The microbial cosmopolitan dispersion hypothesis often invoked to explain distribution patterns driven by high connectivity of oceanographic water masses and widespread dispersal ability has never been rigorously tested. By using a global marine bacterial dataset and iterative matrix randomization simulation, we show that marine bacteria exhibit a significantly greater dispersal limitation than predicted by our null model using the everything is everywhere tenet with no dispersal limitation scenario. Specifically, marine bacteria displayed bipolar distributions (i.e., species occurring exclusively at both poles and nowhere else) significantly less often than in the null model. Furthermore, we observed fewer taxa present in both hemispheres but more taxa present only in a single hemisphere than expected under the null model. Each of these trends diverged further from the null expectation as the compared habitats became more geographically distant but more environmentally similar. Our meta-analysis supported a latitudinal gradient in bacterial diversity with higher richness at lower latitudes, but decreased richness toward the poles. Bacteria in the tropics also demonstrated narrower latitudinal ranges at lower latitudes and relatively larger ranges in higher latitudes, conforming to the controversial macroecological pattern of the Rapoport rule. Collectively, our findings suggest that bacteria follow biogeographic patterns more typical of macroscopic organisms, and that dispersal limitation, not just environmental selection, likely plays an important role. Distributions of microbes that deliver critical ecosystemservices, particularly those in polar regions, may be vulnerable to the same impacts that environmental stressors, climate warming, and degradation in habitat quality are having on biodiversity in animal and plant species.

J	Aguilar, M; Lado, C				Aguilar, Maria; Lado, Carlos			Ecological niche models reveal the importance of climate variability for the biogeography of protosteloid amoebae	ISME JOURNAL												Habitat availability and environmental preferences of species are among the most important factors in determining the success of dispersal processes and therefore in shaping the distribution of protists. We explored the differences in fundamental niches and potential distributions of an ecological guild of slime moulds-protosteloid amoebae-in the Iberian Peninsula. A large set of samples collected in a north-east to south-west transect of approximately 1000 km along the peninsula was used to test the hypothesis that, together with the existence of suitable microhabitats, climate conditions may determine the probability of survival of species. Although protosteloid amoebae share similar morphologies and life history strategies, canonical correspondence analyses showed that they have varied ecological optima, and that climate conditions have an important effect in niche differentiation. Maxent environmental niche models provided consistent predictions of the probability of presence of the species based on climate data, and they were used to generate maps of potential distribution in an everything is everywhere scenario. The most important climatic factors were, in both analyses, variables that measure changes in conditions throughout the year, confirming that the alternation of fruiting bodies, cysts and amoeboid stages in the life cycles of protosteloid amoebae constitutes an advantage for surviving in a changing environment. Microhabitat affinity seems to be influenced by climatic conditions, which suggests that the micro-environment may vary at a local scale and change together with the external climate at a larger scale.

FUNGAL BIOLOGY												Aspergillus flavus is one of the most common fungal eukaryotes on the planet. It is notorious for production of aflatoxins, for causing aspergillosis in humans and animals, and as an opportunistic pathogen of animals and plants. Its role in marine habitats is unclear. Until now, little phylogeographic structure has been detected for the species, except at very local scales, and it appears to fit the classic dictum of microbial biogeography: Everything is everywhere. Here we use genetic relationships among isolates to determine phylogeographic structure, mating types, and differences in preferences for: marine vs. terrestrial habitats, various substrates, and clinical vs. nonclinical environments. Phylogenetic relationships among isolates were estimated using amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) and mating types were determined for a worldwide sample of A. flavus isolates from diverse substrates and geographic locations. All isolates composed a single population, with no significant differentiation of marine us. terrestrial isolates, clinical vs. environmental isolates, or association with substrate or geographic origin. There was evidence for local dominance of a single clade, probably clonal in origin and short-lived. The proportion of mating types was 1:1, supporting the hypothesis of recombination in natural populations. However, a high proportion of clinical isolates were MAT1-1 (85 %), suggesting that a gene linked to the MAT1-1 idiomorph could play a role in pathogenicity. This study suggests that a more appropriate description of the phylogeography of A. flavus is everything is everywhere, but not all the time. (C) 2012 The British Mycological Society.

S	Pedros-Alio, C		Carlson, CA; Giovannoni, SJ		Pedros-Alio, Carlos			The Rare Bacterial Biosphere	ANNUAL REVIEW OF MARINE SCIENCE, VOL 4	Annual Review of Marine Science											All communities are dominated by a few species that account for most of the biomass and carbon cycling. On the other hand, a large number of species are represented by only a few individuals. In the case of bacteria, these rare species were until recently invisible. Owing to their low numbers, conventional molecular techniques could not retrieve them. Isolation in pure culture was the only way to identify some of them, but current culturing techniques are unable to isolate most of the bacteria in nature. The recent development of fast and cheap high-throughput sequencing has begun to allow access to the rare species. In the case of bacteria, the exploration of this rare biosphere has several points of interest. First, it will eventually produce a reasonable estimate of the total number of bacterial taxa in the oceans; right now, we do not even know the right order of magnitude. Second, it will answer the question of whether everything is everywhere. Third, it will require hypothesizing and testing the ecological mechanisms that allow subsistence of many species in low numbers. And fourth, it will open an avenue of research into the immense reserve of genes with potential applications hidden in the rare biosphere.

Significant habitat effects influence protist fitness: evidence for local adaptation from acidic mining lakes	ECOSPHERE												It is currently controversially discussed if the same freshwater microorganisms occur worldwide wherever their required habitats are realized, i.e., without any adaptation to local conditions below the species level. We performed laboratory experiments with flagellates and ciliates from three acidic mining lakes (AML, pH similar to 2.7) to investigate if similar habitats may affect similar organisms differently. Such man-made lakes provide suitable ecosystem models to test for the significance of strong habitat selection. To this end, we analyzed the growth response of three protist taxa (three strains of the phytoflagellate Chlamydomonas acidophila, two isolates of the phytoflagellate Ochromonas and two species of the ciliate genus Oxytricha) by exposing them to lake water of their origin and from the two other AML in a cross-factorial design. Population growth rates were measured as a proxy for their fitness. Results revealed significant effects of strain, lake (= habitat), and strain X habitat interaction. In the environmentally most adverse AML, all three protist taxa were locally adapted. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that (1) the same habitat may affect strains of the same species differently and that (2) similar habitats may harbor ecophysiologically different strains or species. These results contradict the everything is everywhere paradigm.																	2150-8925					DEC	2011	2	12							UNSP 134	10.1890/ES11-00157.1						WOS:000208811300006

Location Marine environments, globally. Methods Studies on geographic variation in all marine eukaryotes smaller than 1 mm and all marine copepods were compiled from the literature and incorporated in multiple binomial regressions to analyse the effect of body size, lifestyle, environmental isolation and taxonomic affinity on the probability of different regions being reciprocally monophyletic. Sample size was also analysed, because a negative relationship between sample size and probability of being reciprocally monophyletic would indicate biases due to undersampling in the original studies. Separate analyses were performed for three potential types of barriers to gene flow for marine organisms (the water barrier of the middle of the oceans, the temperature barrier of the equator, and the land barrier of the continents). Results Environmental isolation was the only variable in the best-fitting model for the probability of populations from each side of an ocean being reciprocally monophyletic. The estimated importance of body size was quite large and the lack of this variable in the best-fitting model may be a power issue due to the small sample size (n = 40). Both environmental isolation and body size were important for the probability of monophyletic populations in different hemispheres. The analysis of isolation between different oceans did not produce clear results. The relationship between sample intensity and probability of being reciprocally monophyletic was positive for the isolation between different oceans and non-existent for the two other analyses. Main conclusions The results showed that body size was an important factor governing the potential for geographic variation but not the only important factor by far. These results clearly weaken the everything is everywhere hypothesis as they showed that microscopic organisms may have geographic variation, albeit to a lesser degree than larger organisms.				; Funch, Peter/B-7437-2009	Faurby, Soren/0000-0002-2974-2628; Funch, Peter/0000-0002-0184-1552												1466-822X	1466-8238				MAY	2011	20	3					475	485		10.1111/j.1466-8238.2010.00609.x						WOS:000289297300010

No biogeographical pattern for a root-associated fungal species complex	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim The biogeography of microbes is poorly understood and there is an open debate regarding if and how microbial biodiversity is structured. At the beginning of the 20th century, Baas Becking laid the foundations for the biogeography of microbes by stating that Everything is everywhere, but the environment selects (the EisE hypothesis). This hypothesis remained dogma for almost a century. However, the recognition that microbial species are often assemblages of reproductively isolated lineages challenged the EisE hypothesis, leading to the now common assumption that microbial communities possess cryptic biogeographic structures. We tested the presence of a cryptic biogeographical structure for a well-characterized fungal species complex (the Phialocephala fortinii s.l.-Acephala applanata species complex, PAC) using precise molecular species resolution. In addition, we analysed factors that could govern PAC community assembling. Locations Forty-four study sites in temperate and boreal forests across the Northern Hemisphere were included. Methods (1) The distance-decay relationship among PAC communities was calculated and a resampling procedure was applied to analyse the effect of sampling intensity and geographic distances among PAC communities. (2) Factors shaping PAC communities (e.g. climatic factors and tree species composition) were studied. (3) We tested PAC communities for random composition. Results We found that the similarity of species assemblages did not decrease with increasing geographical distance. Moreover, species diversity did not increase by expanding the area sampled. Instead, species diversity increased by increasing the sampling effort. Community composition correlated neither with tree species composition nor climate, and no association among species was observed. Main conclusions We could not discover any cryptic biogeographic structure even after applying refined species assignment but we demonstrate the importance of sampling effort for understanding the biogeography of microorganisms. Moreover, we show that primarily stochastic effects are responsible for the species composition of PAC communities.

J	Locey, KJ				Locey, Kenneth J.			Synthesizing traditional biogeography with microbial ecology: the importance of dormancy	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY												The discovery of biogeographical patterns among microbial communities has led to a focus on the empirical evaluation of the importance of dispersal limitation in microbial biota. As a result, the spatial distribution of microbial diversity has been increasingly studied while the synthesis of biogeographical theory with microbial ecology remains undeveloped. To make biogeographical theory relevant to microbial ecology, microbial traits that potentially affect the distribution of microbial diversity need to be considered. Given that many microorganisms in natural environments are in a state of dormancy and that dormancy is an important microbial fitness trait, I provide a first attempt to account for the effects of dormancy on microbial biogeography by treating dormancy as a fundamental biogeographical response. I discuss the effects of dormancy on the equilibrium theory of island biogeography and on the unified neutral theory of biodiversity and biogeography, and suggest how the equilibrium theory of island biogeography can produce predictions approaching those of the Baas-Becking hypothesis (i.e. everything is everywhere, but the environment selects).

Since then, species abundance patterns were determined for several environments, but temporal changes in species composition were not studied to the same level of resolution. Using massively parallel sequencing on the 454 GS FLX platform we identified a highly dynamic turnover of the seasonal abundance of protists in the Austrian lake Fuschlsee. We show that seasonal abundance patterns of protists closely match their biogeographic distribution. The stable predominance of few highly abundant taxa, which previously led to the suggestion of a low global protist species richness, is contrasted by a highly dynamic turnover of rare species. We suggest that differential seasonality of rare and abundant protist taxa explains the-so far-conflicting evidence in the everything is everywhere dispute. Consequently temporal sampling is basic for adequate diversity and species richness estimates.

J	Thurber, RV				Thurber, Rebecca Vega			Current insights into phage biodiversity and biogeography	CURRENT OPINION IN MICROBIOLOGY												Phages exert tremendous ecological and evolutionary forces directly on their bacterial hosts. Phage induced cell lysis also indirectly contributes to organic and inorganic nutrient recycling. Phage abundance, diversity, and distribution are therefore important parameters in ecosystem function. The assumption that phage consortia are ubiquitous and homogenous across habitats (everything is everywhere) is currently being re-evaluated. New studies on phage biogeography have found that some phages are globally distributed while others are unique and perhaps endemic to specific environments. Furthermore, advances in technology have allowed scientists to conduct experiments aimed at analyzing phage consortia over temporal scales, and surprisingly have found reoccurring patterns. This review discusses currents in the field of phage ecology with particular focus on efforts to characterize phage diversity and biogeography across various spatial and temporal scales.																	1369-5274					OCT	2009	12	5					582	587		10.1016/j.mib.2009.08.008						WOS:000271563200017	19811946	
J	Guil, N; Sanchez-Moreno, S; Machordom, A				Guil, Noemi; Sanchez-Moreno, Sara; Machordom, Annie			Local biodiversity patterns in micrometazoans: Are tardigrades everywhere?	SYSTEMATICS AND BIODIVERSITY												The aim of this paper was to assess the relationships between habitat type and diversity indices, richness and abundance of terrestrial tardigrade communities. Our analyses are based on results from a survey performed in Sierra de Guadarrama, in the centre of the Iberian Peninsula. We performed a multi-habitat intensive sampling in terrestrial environments (mosses and lichens on rocks, tree trunks and leaf litter), to test if local biodiversity patterns for tardigrades exist, to test the everything is everywhere hypothesis, and if distributions can be attributed exclusively to environmental properties (as proposed for protists), or to a combination of historical and environmental events (as proposed for larger metazoans). Our analyses of richness, diversity indices and abundance of tardigrade communities revealed habitat-dependent patterns on these community descriptors. Leaf litter habitats showed high species richness and low abundances, rock habitats (mosses and lichens) showed intermediate species richness scores and high abundances, and trunk habitats (mosses and lichens) showed low numbers of both richness and abundances. Besides, common tardigrade species, and not scarce ones, determined the difference on tardigrade community composition between different habitats. We also describe two opposite patterns in tardigrade assemblages characterised by Heterotardigrada vs. Eutardigrada species; while Heterotardigrada-based communities presented low species richness and large tardigrade numbers, Eutardigrada-based assemblages showed high species richness and low abundances. in conclusion, tardigrade local biodiversity across habitats exhibited patterns closer to larger animals than to unicellular microorganisms even when environmental and biological conditions (small size, dispersal forms) are closer to these last organisms. Implications of these findings are discussed.

Enrichment and identification of polycyclic aromatic compound-degrading bacteria enriched from sediment samples	BIODEGRADATION												The degradation of polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs) has been widely studied. Knowledge of the degradation of PACs by microbial populations can be utilized in the remediation of contaminated sites. To isolate and identify PAC-degrading bacteria for potential use in future bioremediation programmes, we established a series of PAC enrichments under the same experimental conditions from a single sediment sample taken from a highly polluted estuarine site. Enrichment cultures were established using the pollutants: anthracene, phenanthrene and dibenzothiophene as a sole carbon source. The shift in microbial community structure on each of these carbon sources was monitored by analysis of a time series of samples from each culture using 16S rRNA polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). Significantly, our findings demonstrate that shifts in the constituent species within each degradative community are directly attributable to enrichment with different PACs. Subsequently, we characterized the microorganisms comprising the degradative communities within each enrichment using 16S rRNA sequence data. Our findings demonstrate that the ability to degrade PACs is present in five divisions of the Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria. By determining the precise identity of the PAC-degrading bacterial species isolated from a single sediment sample, and by comparing our findings with previously published research, we demonstrate how bacteria with similar PAC degrading capabilities and 16S rRNA signatures are found in similarly polluted environments in geographically very distant locations, e.g., China, Italy, Japan and Hawaii. Such a finding suggests that geographical barriers do not limit the distribution of key PAC-degrading bacteria; this finding is in accordance with the Baas-Becking hypothesis everything is everywhere; the environment selects and may have significant consequences for the global distribution of PAC-degrading bacteria and their use in bioremediation.																	0923-9820					JUL	2009	20	4					521	531		10.1007/s10532-008-9241-z						WOS:000266644100006	19132328

Molecular evidence for broad-scale distributions in bdelloid rotifers: everything is not everywhere but most things are very widespread	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												The Baas-Beckings hypothesis, also known by the term everything is everywhere (EisE), states that microscopic organisms such as bacteria and protists are globally distributed and do not show biogeographical patterns, due to their high dispersal potential. We tested the prediction of the EisE hypothesis on bdelloid rotifers, microscopic animals similar to protists in size and ecology that present one of the best cases among animals for the plausibility of global dispersal. Geographical range sizes and patterns of isolation by distance were estimated for global collections of the genera Adineta and Rotaria, using different taxonomic units: (i) traditional species based on morphology, (ii) the most inclusive monophyletic lineages from a cytochrome oxidase I phylogeny comprising just a single traditional species, and (iii) genetic clusters indicative of independently evolving lineages. Although there are cases of truly cosmopolitan distribution, even at the most finely resolved taxonomic level, most genetic clusters are distributed at continental or lower scales. Nevertheless, although everything is not everywhere, bdelloid rotifers do display broad distributions typical of those of other microscopic organisms. Broad dispersal and large population sizes might be factors lessening the evolutionary cost of long-term abstinence from sexual reproduction in this famous group of obligate parthenogens.

GENE												Marine phytoplanktons are highly dispersed with large population sizes and are often considered to be homogenous over their entire range. Thus, using this definition, one would predict that everything is everywhere for these microbes. However, recent molecular analyses have shown both spatial and temporal compartmentalisation in phytoplankton communities, thus calling into question the idea that everything is everywhere, especially if they do not share a global gene pool. Examples are present to document the range of biogeography that has been reported in the phytoplankton and a hypothesis as to how this relates to species evolution on a geological time scale is provided.

Not all free-living microorganisms have cosmopolitan distributions - the case of Nebela (Apodera) vas Certes (Protozoa : Amoebozoa : Arcellinida)	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim To review and critically assess the evidence that the testate amoeba species Nebela vas does not have a cosmopolitan distribution, in contradiction to the paradigm of microbial distribution that everything is everywhere. Location Terrestrial and wetland habitats world-wide. Methods Relevant data were assembled on the morphology, ecology and global geographical distribution of N. vas from a comprehensive literature review of published original records. The data were collated, analysed and summarized. The roles of long-term and short-term agents of dispersal are discussed. Results A clear and repeated pattern has been elucidated of a microbial species, with a distinctive and unmistakeable morphology, that inhabits acid, damp terrestrial and wetland habitats in the southern cool-temperate and sub-Antarctic zones - including similar high-altitude habitats in the Tropics. It is almost entirely confined to the Gondwanaland continents and Southern Hemisphere islands. It is definitively absent from Holarctic regions. It is proposed that the continental distribution of N. vas is a consequence of continental drift following its original speciation in the Mesozoic or earlier, whereas its distribution on sub-Antarctic islands (glaciated in the Pleistocene) has been effected by dispersal from South America by wind around the Southern Ocean. Main conclusion Nebela vas is a proven instance of a microbial species that does not have a cosmopolitan distribution.																	0305-0270					OCT	2007	34	10					1822	1831		10.1111/j.1365-2699.2007.01733.x						WOS:000249663300014

One prevailing idea is that everything is everywhere, and the environment selects, implying that all types of bacteria are present in all environments where their growth requirements are met. We tested this hypothesis using actinomycete communities and type II polyketide synthase (PKS) genes found in soils collected from New Jersey and Uzbekistan (n = 91). Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis using actinomycete 16S rRNA and type II PKS genes was employed to determine community profiles. The terminal fragment frequencies in soil samples had a lognormal distribution, indicating that the majority of actinomycete phylotypes and PKS pathways are present infrequently in the environment. Less than 1% of peaks were detected in more than 50% of samples, and as many as 18% of the fragments were unique and detected in only one sample. Actinomycete 16S rRNA fingerprints clustered by country of origin, indicating that unique populations are present in North America and Central Asia. Sequence analysis of type II PKS gene fragments cloned from Uzbek soil revealed 35 novel sequence clades whose levels of identity to genes in the GenBank database ranged from 68 to 92%. The data indicate that actinomycetes are patchily distributed but that distinct populations are present in North American and Central Asia. These results have implications for microbial bioprospecting and indicate that the cosmopolitan actinomycete species and PKS pathways may account for only a small proportion of the total diversity in soil.

Allopatric divergence, secondary contact and genetic isolation in wild yeast populations	CURRENT BIOLOGY												In plants and animals, new biological species clearly have arisen as a byproduct of genetic divergence in allopatry. However, our understanding of the processes that generate new microbial species remains limited [1] despite the large contribution of microbes to the worlds biodiversity. A recent hypothesis claims that microbes lack biogeographical divergence because their population sizes are large and their migration rates are presumably high [2, 3]. In recapitulating the classic microbial-ecology dictum that everything is everywhere, and the environment selects [4, 5], this hypothesis casts doubt on whether geographic divergence promotes speciation in microbes. To date, its predictions have been tested primarily with data from eubacteria and archaebacteria [6-8]. However, this hypothesiss most important implication is in sexual eukaryotic microbes, where migration and genetic admixture are specifically predicted to inhibit allopatric divergence and speciation [9]. Here, we use nuclear-sequence data from globally distributed natural populations of the yeast Saccharomyces paradoxus to investigate the role of geography in generating diversity in sexual eukaryotic microbes. We show that these populations have undergone allopatric divergence and then secondary contact without genetic admixture. Our data thus support the occurrence of evolutionary processes necessary for allopatric speciation in sexual microbes.																	0960-9822					MAR 6	2007	17	5					407	411		10.1016/j.cub.2006.12.047						WOS:000244817000022	17306538

Do geographically separated populations of micro-organisms diverge independently, or does their structure fit the often quoted Bass-Becking description everything is everywhere; the environment selects? Aided by high-resolution genetic and genomic tools, the search for microbial marsupials has revealed that in fact both are true; some species of micro-organisms demonstrate allopatric divergence, while others do not. This discovery opens the door for comparative analyses, where questions about the differences in evolutionary and ecological mechanisms that drive divergence and speciation in different microbial species can begin to be explored. Investigating these differences in evolutionary mechanisms will greatly enhance interest in, and understanding of, the dynamic processes that create and maintain the vast diversity of the microbial world.																	0962-8436					NOV 29	2006	361	1475					1975	1984		10.1098/rstb.2006.1927						WOS:000241920600009	17062415

TRENDS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Estimates of the order of magnitude for the total number of microbial species on Earth range from 10(3) to 10(9). Despite global dispersal of microorganisms, this number is probably rather large. The total biodiversity of an ecosystem is composed of two elements: first, a set of abundant taxa that carry out most ecosystem functions, grow actively and suffer intense losses through predation and viral lysis. These taxa are retrievable with molecular techniques but are difficult to grow in culture. Second, there is a seed bank of many rare taxa that are not growing or grow extremely slowly, do not experience viral lysis and predation is reduced. Such taxa are seldom retrieved by molecular techniques but many can be grown in culture, which explains the dictum everything is everywhere.

J	Foissner, W				Foissner, Wilhelm			Biogeography and dispersal of micro-organisms: A review emphasizing protists	ACTA PROTOZOOLOGICA												This review summarizes data on the biogeography and dispersal of bacteria, microfungi and selected protists, such as dinoflagellates, chrysophytes, testate amoebae, and ciliates. Furthermore, it introduces the restricted distribution and dispersal of mosses, ferns and macrofungi as arguments into the discussion on the postulated cosmopolitism and ubiquity of protists. Estimation of diversity and distribution of micro-organisms is greatly disturbed by undersampling, the scarcity of taxonomists, and the frequency of misidentifications. Thus, probably more than 50% of the actual diversity has not yet been described in many protist groups. Notwithstanding, it has been shown that a restricted geographic distribution of micro-organisms occurs in limnetic, marine, terrestrial, and fossil ecosystems. Similar as, in cryptogams and macrofungi about, 30% of the extant supragenefic taxa, described and undescribed, might be morphological and/or genetic and/or molecular endemics. At the present state of knowledge, micro-organism endemicity can be proved/disproved mainly by flagship species, excluding sites (e.g., university ponds) prone to be contaminated by invaders. In future, genetic and molecular data will be increasingly helpful. The wide distribution of many micro-organisms has been attributed to their small size and their astronomical numbers. However, this interpretation is flawed by data from macrofungi, mosses and ferns, many of which occupy distinct areas, in spite of their minute and abundant means of dispersal (spores). Thus, I suggest historic events (split of Pangaea etc.), limited cyst viability and, especially, time as major factors for dispersal and provinciality of micro-organisms. Furthermore, the true number of species and their distribution can hardly be estimated by theories and statistics but require reliable investigations on the number of morphospecies in representative ecosystems. Generally, the doubts on Beijerincks famous metaphor in micro-organisms everything is everywhere can be focussed on a simple question: If the world is teeming with cosmopolitan unicells, where is everybody?																	0065-1583	1689-0027				MAY	2006	45	2					111	136								WOS:000237675700001

Until 1980 it was assumed that there are no freshwater-specific bacteria and that the total number of bacterial species is low. The advent of molecular tools over the last ten years revealed that there is a bacterial freshwater assemblage which is phylogenetically different from soil and marine bacteria; secondly, it became obvious that the total number of cultured bacterial species (similar to 5900) underestimates bacterial diversity by several orders of magnitude. The current debate centres on 1) how to define a bacterial species and 2) if there is a microbial biogeography. The latter relates to the issue of ubiquity and cosmopolitanism, which is controversially discussed primarily in relation to eukaryotic microorganisms, namely ciliates. Although solid evidence is scarce, many microbial ecologists assume, in accordance with Baas Beckings famous 70-year old dictum - everything is everywhere, the environment selects - that freshwater microorganisms are easily dispersed and, therefore, potentially cosmopolitan. This review focuses on the often neglected second part of Baas Beckings metaphor. Evidence is accumulating rapidly that the environment does not simply act as a filter sensu Gleasons individualistic concept for widely dispersed microbes. Rather, prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms have adapted to their specific habitat and perform better in this environment than newly invading congeners. There is an enormous ecophysiological diversity among closely related freshwater microbes which is neither obvious at the morphospecies level nor at the level of evolutionarily conserved genes, such as the small ribosomal RNA gene. Although this large diversity has been demonstrated for various groups of bacteria and protists, there is currently no measure available to compare microbial biodiversity across prokaryotic and eukaryotic domains. The current challenge is to link genetic divergence to ecophysiological diversity in the major taxa.																	1505-2249						2006	54	4					633	652								WOS:000243236300008

Our analyses of genetic variation in ciliate morphospecies isolated from ephemeral environments (freshwater ponds and tide pools) redefine this debate. In 2 different clades of oligotrich ciliates (in the genera Halteria/Meseres and Strombidium), we found both high levels of diversity and evidence of high gene flow as indicated by the presence of identical haplotypes across broad geographic ranges. Five recognizable morphospecies of Halteria/Meseres were found to be composed of 7 different clades, differing by as much as 7.6% sequence divergence at the ITS locus (ITS 1, ITS2 and 5.8S rDNA). Two recognizable morphospecies of Strombidium (S. oculatum and S. stylifer) resolved into 10 distinct clades, differing by as much as 15.7% at the same locus. For both groups of ciliates, the genetic divergence underlying these morphospecies may be related to cycles of isolation in their ephemeral habitats (freshwater lakes and ponds for Halteria/Meseres and tide pools for Strombidium). By comparison, there is both low diversity and high gene flow in published data on ciliates from open coastal water (Laboea strobila and several species of tintinnids), a more stable environment over evolutionary time-scales. Our analyses indicate that models of microbial diversity must test for ecologically driven patterns in the interactions of gene flow and species richness to account for observed patterns of high dispersal and high gene flow.

The ubiquity of microorganisms in close association with all living things and biogeochemical processes on Earth predicates that they must also play a critical role in maintaining the viability of human life in space. Even though bacterial populations exist as locally adapted ecotypes, the abundance of individuals in microbial species is so large that dispersal is unlikely to be limited by geographical barriers on Earth (i.e., for most environments everything is everywhere given enough time). This will not be true for microbial communities in space where local species richness will be relatively low because of sterilization protocols prior to launch and physical barriers between Earth and spacecraft after launch. Although community diversity will be sufficient to sustain ecosystem function at the onset, richness and evenness may decline over time such that biological systems either lose functional potential (e.g., bioreactors may fail to reduce BOD or nitrogen load) or become susceptible to invasion by human-associated microorganisms (pathogens) over time. Research at the John F. Kennedy Space Center has evaluated fundamental properties of microbial diversity and community assembly in prototype bioregenerative systems for NASA Advanced Life Support. Successional trends related to increased niche specialization, including an apparent increase in the proportion of nonculturable types of organisms, have been consistently observed. In addition, the stability of the microbial communities, as defined by their resistance to invasion by human-associated microorganisms, has been correlated to their diversity. Overall, these results reflect the significant challenges ahead for the assembly of stable, functional communities using gnotobiotic approaches, and the need to better define the basic biological principles that define ecosystem processes in the space environment.																	0095-3628	1432-184X				FEB	2004	47	2					137	149		10.1007/s00248-003-1060-5						WOS:000221223100006	14994179	
J	Lachance, MA				Lachance, MA			The Phaff school of yeast ecology	INTERNATIONAL MICROBIOLOGY					19th National Congress of Microbiology	SEP 21-25, 2003	SANTIAGO COMPOSTE, SPAIN	Spanish Soc Microbiol, Ramon Areces Fdn				Herman Jan Phaffs legacy includes pioneering work on the yeast cell envelope and the application of molecular approaches to yeast systematics. Clearly, his interest and knowledge spanned the whole gamut of yeast biology. Yet, his most original and most heartfelt contribution was to our understanding of the position occupied by yeasts in nature. This view developed through the juxtaposition of his childhood exposure to industrial fermentations and his training in the tradition of Beijerincks Delft School of Microbiology. Through sonic of Phaffs recent writings, I have attempted to formulate the themes or principles that were implicit to his ecological thinking. Six focal points emerge. (1) Yeasts in themselves are a sufficient object of study. (2) A clear idea of a yeast community cannot be obtained unless the yeast species are correctly identified. (3) Ecologically meaningful conclusions require an adequate sample size. (4) The bacteriological dictum everything is everywhere is a poor account of yeast distributions. (5) The habitat is the cornerstone of yeast ecology. (6) Ecology is the most exciting aspect of yeast biology.																	1139-6709					SEP	2003	6	3					163	167		10.1007/s10123-003-0129-9						WOS:000186379900003	12884059	
J	Fenchel, T; Esteban, GF; Finlay, BJ				Fenchel, T; Esteban, GF; Finlay, BJ			Local versus global diversity of microorganisms: cryptic diversity of ciliated protozoa	OIKOS												Microbial species diversity both global and local, is still poorly understood. III this study all species of ciliated protozoa were recorded microscopically from similar to 1 cm(2) sediment collected from a small lake and item a marine shallow-water bay. Additional adjacent sediment samples (together representing < 50 cm(2)) were then incubated under a variety of culture conditions to reveal cryptic species that are present as resting cysts or are too rare to be found microscopically. About 85 and 57% of the total number of observed species from the limnic and marine sediment, respectively, were such cryptic species. In both cases the number of species found in < 50 cm(2) of sediment represented about 75% of all ciliate species ever recorded from these two previously well-studied habitats, and about 8% of all named free-living ciliates. These observations support the assumption thar in the case of microorganisms everything is everywhere and that their global species diversity is relatively limited.
