Please find further details about how data relating to each variable was collected below.

title: The publication title from which each distance-decay relationship was obtained.
year: The year of publication for each distance-decay relationship.
journal: The journal within which each distance-decay relationship was published.
method: The method by which microbial communities were characterised. Abbreviated methods are defined as follows: TRFLP = Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism; ARISA = Automated Ribosomal Intergenic Spacer Analysis; DGGE = Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis; PLFA = Phospholipid Fatty Acid analysis; Sanger = Sanger sequencing of cloned phylogenetically informative genes).
markerGene: The specific genetic locus that was amplified and sequenced for amplicon sequencing-based studies/
nSamples: The number of samples each distance-decay relationship was based on, including replicate samples.
seqDepth: This refers to the sequencing depth in sequencing-based studies, or number of individuals counted in morphology-based studies, per sample. For sequencing studies, we recorded the number of sequences after rarefaction, or if this was not given, the average number of sequences per sample. As there is no comparable measure of coverage for fingerprinting studies, we excluded them from analyses of community coverage.
simIndex: The dissimilarity index used to calculate each distance-decay relationship. Recorded dissimilarity indices were then categorised as quantitative (Bray-Curtis, Horn-Morisita, Euclidean, Hellinger, Theta), qualitative (Jaccard, Raup-Crick, Sørensen, Simpson, βsim), or phylogenetic (weighted or unweighted Unifrac, Rao, β-mean nearest taxon distance, β-mean pairwise distance).
otuDefinition: The sequence similarity threshold at which operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were defined, if used.
taxa: Each distance-decay relationship was binned into the following broad taxonomic categories based on the taxonomy of the focal organisms (Archaea, Bacteria, Fungi, or other microbial Eukarya), or combination of these categories if a relationship was based on multiple taxa (for example due to using sequencing primers that detect both Archaea and Bacteria). Fungi grouped separately from other micro-Eukaryotes due to their distinct reproductive strategy (e.g. spore-production) and the fact the they are frequently targeted using distinct molecular approaches (e.g. via taxon-specific primer sets), in contrast to most other studies of micro-Eukarya.
habitat: The type of environmental material that the sampled communities occupied. We categorised distance-decay relationships as: air, host-associated, sediment, snow, soil, water.
environment: We broadly categorised distance-decay relationships based on the type of environment (agriculture, air, aquifer, coastal wetlands/intertidal, desert, dune, forest, glacier, grassland, lake, marine, coastal marshes, mine, river, snow, urban) within which they were sampled. Whilst these categories are not mutually exclusive, we categorised each study based on which environment best represented the environmental context in which each study was undertaken. For studies on lakes, we also recorded whether relationships originated from a single lake, or across multiple lakes.
within_lake: For studies based on lake communities, within indicates that all sampled communities came from a single lake, whereas between indicates that communities derived from across multiple lakes.
spatialExtent: This is the maximum distance separating communities in km. If this was not stated in text or provided in supplementary material (e.g. in a geographic distance matrix), it was calculated from given geographic coordinates, estimated from a plot of the distance-decay relationship, or estimated from scaled maps.
mantelR: The extracted Mantel Correlation Coefficient.
pValue: The P-value associated with each Mantel Correlation coefficient.
correlation: Where stated, the specific correlation metric used to calculate the Mantel correlation coefficient.
